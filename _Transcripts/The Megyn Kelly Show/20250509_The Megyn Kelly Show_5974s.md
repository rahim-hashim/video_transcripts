# Meghan Pretends She's a Founder, "Famedigger" Hilaria, and Launching "Spot On," with Link Lauren
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=0.0s)]
*  Okay, can I just tell you something before we get started? You know what I did this morning? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4.4s)]
*  I did the best thing. The best, best thing. It was a talent show at our daughter's middle school. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=8.08s)]
*  She's finishing eighth grade. And so it was all the girls in this middle school doing their thing. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=16.0s)]
*  I am such a sucker for this stuff. Guys, I cried like five times. I just like not like the ugly cry, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=21.92s)]
*  but cried. I mean like actual tears over what? Kids, I do not know. Like some random [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=28.72s)]
*  child getting up there and singing. You know, some amazing, some not that amazing. Didn't matter. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=35.6s)]
*  Just like the, just the risk of it. You know, just these little girls getting up there and like [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=43.76s)]
*  standing alone in front of a microphone, looking out at a full audience and singing. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=49.519999999999996s)]
*  That takes guts. That's ballsy. And then other girls do it was like everything from like one [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=56.96s)]
*  girl did the Irish, you know, step dancing. That was great. And another girl played the violin, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=63.6s)]
*  another girl, she was sleeper, a sleeper candidate came out there with a guitar. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=70.0s)]
*  She played the first couple of chords. I was like, okay, let's see if she can play. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=73.84s)]
*  And then she started singing. She's a voice of an angel. It was like brought down the house. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=77.04s)]
*  My daughter and her dear, dear friend have done the same thing. I think all four years of middle [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=82.8s)]
*  school in our town. It goes fifth through eighth, where they put on an enormous animal costume and [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=88.4s)]
*  do a dance to get like last year. I think they were a horse. And this year, I don't know what [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=95.6s)]
*  the custom was this year. It was a dog. It was an unidentifiable. So all of it, it just makes me cry [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=100.64s)]
*  because it's like risk taking a moment in the spotlight. And here's the other thing I loved [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=107.12s)]
*  about it. I loved that these girls, you know how we talk about mean girls. And that's, that's a [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=112.96000000000001s)]
*  thing. That's for sure. That's a thing. Well, here's the great thing about girls that you [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=119.44s)]
*  probably aren't going to see at the all boys assembly. All of them, like with their arms up [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=126.0s)]
*  for the listening audience, I'm waving like hands left to right and with every girl singing, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=132.48s)]
*  with every girl's piano solo, you know, the whole auditorium and like shouting out the girls, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=137.67999999999998s)]
*  like total support, solidarity, sisterhood, not a hint of mean girl action, not a hint of it, [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=145.28s)]
*  just total support and like clicks for their fellow middle schoolers. It was so uplifting. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=152.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't know how they managed to make middle school pleasant, but they did. My daughter had [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=159.04s)]
*  a great time in it. I watched it happen with her and her friends and congrats to all these, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=163.44s)]
*  all these girls who are trying to do middle school in a different way. And to these girls who got up [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=168.79999999999998s)]
*  on stage today and sat in the front row of their life. Love it. Absolutely love it. Okay. We right [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=173.92s)]
*  here have a great show lined up for you. It's not going to have Irish step dancing, but it is going [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  to have link Lauren, which is, I mean, almost as good. He's the latest member of our MK media [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=185.84s)]
*  team and his podcast launches on Monday. He's a former senior advisor to RFKJ, which is perfect [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=192.16s)]
*  because there is so much maha drama happening right now. And link is ready to spill the tea. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=201.04s)]
*  As they say, there's plenty to get to, including the continued media storm around the nomination [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=207.44s)]
*  of Casey means to surge in general, but it kind of goes beyond that. And there's new reporting [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=212.88s)]
*  today on the relationship between 73 year old Bill Belichick and 24 year old Jordan Hudson. Is [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  she banned from the university of North Carolina? Link is going to tell us why he's team Jordan. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=223.04s)]
*  What he is the host of the new podcast spot on with link Lauren. It launches Monday. Here's a preview. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=230.48s)]
*  Take a look. It's 2025. The Democrats are in free fall, stumping for gang members and men and [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=238.32s)]
*  women's sports. Disney is tanking Dylan Mulvaney's writing memoirs. It's a crazy world. We're living [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  in my name is link Lauren, and I'm here to guide you through it all, but make no mistake. This is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=251.2s)]
*  not a safe space. And if Kamala Harris, if it were her cocaine, she probably would have been a lot [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=256.8s)]
*  more productive as a vice president. They didn't think it was a threat to democracy. Having a [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=261.6s)]
*  brain dead president, Joe Biden for the last four years, tired of people just getting James [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=266.08s)]
*  Carville his flowers because he's our elder. I'm not going to just respect my elders. He is a swamp [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=270.56s)]
*  creature. My new show spot on with link Lauren officially launches Monday, May 12th with MK media. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=276.24s)]
*  I'm a content creator and political commentator who built trust with my audience by calling it [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  like I see it. That's not changing. You might know me from Tik TOK TV, the Kennedy campaign, [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=286.71999999999997s)]
*  and some of you might not know me at all. With spot on, we're going to dive into the swampy [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=293.52s)]
*  waters of Washington, DC, the woke cesspool of Hollywood and everything in between. Let the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=297.91999999999996s)]

*  so sweet and even a little good. Cannot imagine life without them. They have a great life, [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=321.36s)]
*  but some dogs are not so lucky. And this is why I'm so glad to tell you about Delta rescue. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=327.28000000000003s)]

*  Megan. I'm so grateful to you. I told you this privately. I have no shame in saying this [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=400.32s)]
*  for years. One of my top career goals was just to even come on the Megan Kelly show. I was like, [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=405.04s)]
*  if Megan would know that I exist someday, I want to go on Megan and I want to go on Bill Maher. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=410.08s)]
*  Those are my two goals. So for years I would hit you guys up. I'd ask people if they knew who [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=414.56s)]
*  booked your show, maybe I could get on Megan Kelly. So for now to have this deal and to have your [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=419.28000000000003s)]
*  blessing. It's like such a God is good, surreal moment. And it's also just a full circle moment [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=424.72s)]
*  for my audience too, because I don't say this with hubris or anything. I know I've worked to earn [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=430.8s)]
*  every single viewer that I have. I turned out thousands of viewers, stay up late, filming, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=435.92s)]
*  editing, giving up time with family just to churn out those videos for them. And so for you giving [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=440.8s)]
*  me a seat at the table, I feel like I've left the side door open for them to come in with me. And [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=445.12s)]
*  I'm just a conduit for what they're interested in and their issues. So we're all so grateful to [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=449.52000000000004s)]
*  Megan and her entire team. So thank you. Thank you. I'm having a Megan Markle moment. Like I [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=453.92s)]
*  have people on the podcast who are just going to say nice things about me. I swear that's not [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=458.8s)]
*  what's happening here. No, I know you hate that. I know you hate that. But I have to. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=462.32s)]
*  Thank you for that. Honestly, we're lucky to have you. You're a total rising star. And in a year, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=467.36s)]
*  everybody's going to be like, Oh my God, why didn't we try harder and get link? And I'm going to look [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=472.0s)]
*  at them all and say too bad and too late. It was very obvious the first time we saw you that you're [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=475.76s)]
*  a special talent and you have a special way of communicating. Not everybody has it. There's a [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=480.8s)]
*  special ingredient list that goes into really connecting with an audience. And even people [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=484.96000000000004s)]
*  who I really respect and who are very charming to me personally don't always have the right combo, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=489.84000000000003s)]
*  at least in my eyes, to really succeed as an independent host in a podcast. And you've got [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=496.16s)]
*  those qualities in Spades Link. Lauren can't wait to watch your numbers go through the roof. Okay. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=502.32s)]
*  Let's get right to it. Yes. Let's get in. And you have a great guest who is Callie Means. Hello. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=508.32s)]
*  Talk about like perfect timing. But before we show a clip from Callie Means, let's talk about [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=515.2s)]
*  Callie Means. Callie Means is the brother of Casey Means. Casey Means is now our nominee for surgeon [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=520.72s)]
*  general. The other woman, Janet Neshawat has been turfed. She's going to take some random job within [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=525.36s)]
*  HHS. My information is it was an RFKJ move all the way. He didn't know or want Janet Neshawat. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=530.16s)]
*  He knew and wanted Casey Means. That makes perfect sense to me because Casey's integral [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=537.6s)]
*  to the whole Maha movement. With all due respect to Janet, she wasn't. She's not really even a part [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=542.88s)]
*  of it. So of course he would want one of his like main gurus, lieutenants. I think she's both to him [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=547.6800000000001s)]
*  right at the helm of his own messaging on health. But my God, this is like the Maha people are, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=554.4s)]
*  they love drama. They're very dramatic, Link. I love them, but this is a lot of drama over [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=561.6s)]
*  the surgeon general pick. I love Casey, but we're treating this like it's the national security [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=569.4399999999999s)]
*  advisor or the secretary of state. So what the hell is happening? Give us your 30,000 foot view. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=577.84s)]
*  You worked for RFKJ, so you know this world and these people very well. And what's happening here? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=584.48s)]
*  Uh-huh. I know way too much. One thing about me is I am known for having no drama, not in a [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=588.32s)]
*  Switzerland way. I never bring drama online. I'm very diplomatic. It's my people in politics know [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  they can trust me. I have seen some things I will never say. I can say with unequivocal certainty, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=600.64s)]
*  I support Casey Means as surgeon general. And I would request that anybody who is contesting [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  Casey, can you name any other surgeon general? Right? All these people online who are upset. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=610.88s)]
*  Is surgeon general some big role that we have followed? No, the fact that we're even talking [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=615.76s)]
*  about it now is a huge win. And I also, I don't say this because I sat down with Callie Means. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=619.8399999999999s)]
*  We taped our interview last week before all of this, but Casey and Callie are some of the most [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=624.8s)]
*  effective surrogates for the maha movement, right? They have been talking about ultra processed foods [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=629.76s)]
*  and food dyes and getting chemicals out of our water for years, far before it was popular in [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  the mainstream. And so I think a lot of these maha folks need to remember a year ago, you couldn't [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=639.12s)]
*  even get the mainstream media to cover these issues. So the fact that they're talking about [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=644.24s)]
*  them now, look how far we've come. And also there's this narrative that Casey and Callie Means, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=647.84s)]
*  they must be Manchurian candidates because they're so skilled on air. They're just so talented [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=653.2s)]
*  and polished. That's who you want in the Trump administration. Howard Lutnick said during the [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=658.32s)]
*  transition when they were nominating people, they would put clips of Scott Besson up on the screen, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=663.52s)]
*  Pam Bondi speaking, and that's how they would decide who to put in the cabinet. They wanted [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=668.0s)]
*  folks who could be effective surrogates. So wouldn't you put Casey in that role? The next [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=672.32s)]
*  thing I'll say is this, from a political calculus standpoint, I think Casey is a genius move. I know [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=676.32s)]
*  Trump is already thinking about the midterms. He's doing tons of MAGA Inc. fundraisers. He's [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=682.08s)]
*  gone to Virginia several times to do fundraisers. Everybody's thinking about the midterms and what [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=686.5600000000001s)]
*  could happen. We have Bobby in there who's a huge maha voice, but to grow the maha MAGA coalition, [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  elevating a strong woman's voice like Casey, who's effective on air and on camera, is such [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=696.96s)]
*  a smart move moving forward. And that's why I support it. Totally. I agree with you on all [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=702.64s)]
*  fronts, but man, oh man, are they trying to take her down? It is the weirdest collective hit. Now, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=708.48s)]
*  listen, without casting these aspersions on any individual, I will say there's no question in my [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=714.08s)]
*  mind that Big Pharma doesn't want her and Big Ag probably doesn't want her. And so she's going [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=719.6s)]
*  to have some very powerful enemies. And we saw this, again, I'm not talking about any individual [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=725.52s)]
*  person, but I guarantee you some collection of the attacks on her that we're seeing on X are bought [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=730.8s)]
*  and paid for. Because we saw this. Remember when they were pushing to not have SNAP benefits include [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=735.6s)]
*  the ability to buy Coca-Cola? And then it came out that some of these people who are going to be [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=743.84s)]
*  hurt by these revisions were trying to pay, like the lobbyists for these groups, were trying to pay [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=749.36s)]
*  random influencers to be like, oh, this is Big Daddy legislation. Conservatives to try to speak [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=754.72s)]
*  to conservatives to try to turn the MAGA group against this reform. And there's no question, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=760.48s)]
*  they're not going to lie down and let somebody like Casey Means become the messenger. They already [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=766.08s)]
*  have to deal with RFKJ. They're pissed off enough about that. So these are very deep pocketed [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=771.28s)]
*  people. And I'm sure there are some online right now who are being paid by them. I'd love to find [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=776.1600000000001s)]
*  out for sure. And then there are others who have legitimate, you know, honest, like questions about [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=781.52s)]
*  Casey. And that's fine. That's politics. Hello. But here's an example of some of the stuff we're [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=786.48s)]
*  hearing. So Callie Means versus Nicole Shanahan. We didn't get to this yesterday. Nicole Shanahan, [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=790.8s)]
*  RFKJ's running mate, can't stand Callie and Casey. I didn't know this, but she came out. I don't have [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=799.36s)]
*  the tweet in front of me. But man, did she lay into them. She called them like Manchurian assets [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=807.92s)]
*  and said, I was promised that if I supported RFKJ in his Senate confirmation for the HHS role, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=816.0799999999999s)]
*  that these two wouldn't come anywhere near HHS or government. So did Bobby lie to me? [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=823.68s)]
*  Or what? Because they, to me, are so weird and aggressive. This is Nicole Shanahan, [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=831.28s)]
*  that they seem like Manchurian assets. Now, Brett Baer asked Bobby Kennedy about that. He had like [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=836.88s)]
*  a health panel of the top health officials last night. And here's what happened. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=845.68s)]
*  She was the top of her, the very top of her medical class at Stanford. She is in every, [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=851.76s)]
*  during her residency, she won every award that she could win. She walked away from traditional [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=857.52s)]
*  medicine because she was not curing patients. She couldn't get anybody within her profession [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=862.56s)]
*  to look at the nutrition contributions to illness. And she said, if we're really going to heal people, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=869.1199999999999s)]
*  if we're healers, we can't just be making our life about billing new procedures. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=875.3599999999999s)]
*  We actually have to figure out new approaches to medicine. Your former running mate weighed in today [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=881.76s)]
*  saying that she wasn't happy about this and said that you're somehow being controlled. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=886.9599999999999s)]
*  Your decisions are being controlled. That's what she, she posted. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=892.32s)]
*  Listen, you guys sitting here, four people who were all canceled during COVID. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=895.28s)]
*  Of these people, you've got an entire leadership of this agency is renegades who are juggernauts [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=901.2s)]
*  against convention and who are trying to look for truth no matter what the cost. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=911.12s)]
*  So nobody's controlling you. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=915.2s)]
*  Among those. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=916.7199999999999s)]
*  So it's interesting. He didn't, you know, he didn't take on is somebody controlling me, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=919.68s)]
*  but he's basically saying everybody up here is a renegade and kind of uncontrollable for the record. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=923.52s)]
*  He was with Dr. J Bhattacharya, who was canceled during COVID, Dr. Marty McCary of Johns Hopkins, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=927.28s)]
*  who now runs FDA and Dr. Mehmet Oz, who's going to be overseeing Medicare. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=931.76s)]
*  And of course, RRKJ, go ahead, link your thoughts. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=936.7199999999999s)]
*  Well, I can tell you, he certainly cannot be bought or controlled. Bobby would probably be [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=939.36s)]
*  much wealthier if he could be. And as for Nicole Shanahan, I'm going to say something that I know [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=944.24s)]
*  she would agree with. Bobby would agree with. They keep saying Bobby's running mate says this. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=949.36s)]
*  RFK's running mate, Nicole Shanahan says this. This isn't a Trump-bant situation where they were [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=954.5600000000001s)]
*  out campaigning together and making tons of decisions together. Besides our March 26th [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=960.08s)]
*  announcement in Oakland at the Henry J. Kaiser Center, which several of us helped to plan. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=964.8s)]
*  I think Bobby and Nicole were in the same room together twice. I think they saw each other get [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=969.2s)]
*  in person two times maybe. So these journalists who are writing, like Nicole is some close advisor, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=973.84s)]
*  an ally of Bobby, who's turned around and shanked him. That's just not the case. Bobby's career [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=979.0400000000001s)]
*  went on. He got the nomination to HHS. He's been killing it at HHS and accomplishing more in the [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=983.44s)]
*  first hundred days than I think any of us ever expected. So this narrative that, oh, his close [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=989.44s)]
*  ally and friend and Nicole has turned on him is just anathema to reality. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=994.48s)]
*  Okay. But she doesn't seem to be in his camp anymore. I mean, that tweet- [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=999.2s)]
*  My team just sent it to me. She writes, this is what she wrote when the Casey Means news broke [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1004.16s)]
*  late on 5-7, so two days ago. This doesn't make any sense. I was promised that if I supported him [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1009.52s)]
*  in his Senate confirmation, neither of these siblings would be working under HHS or in an [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1015.4399999999999s)]
*  appointment and that people much more qualified would be. I don't know if RFK very clearly lied [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1019.36s)]
*  to me or what's going on. It's been clear in recent conversations that he is reporting to [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1024.32s)]
*  someone regularly who is controlling his decisions and it isn't President Trump. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1028.56s)]
*  Then she says the part about the siblings being artificial and aggressive and Manchurian. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1033.44s)]
*  So she's turned on him. There's no question in my mind reading that tweet. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1037.04s)]
*  There's no love lost between these two. We don't know why. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1041.12s)]
*  Well, my point I'm making is that it's not a turn on him situation. I don't think they were super [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1042.6399999999999s)]
*  simpatico 12 months ago. That's the point I'm trying to make. They're painting this narrative [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1048.72s)]
*  that, oh, his close ally, they've turned on each other. This is the Maha Civil War. She's been [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1053.04s)]
*  doing her own thing since kind of the start of the campaign when she joined us in Oakland. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1057.68s)]
*  Like I said, they only appeared together, I believe, twice for events. So Bobby's been [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1062.24s)]
*  doing his own thing. And like I said, he's the one with the pedigree. He is the face of Maha. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1066.64s)]
*  He's the head of Maha. Casey and Callie have been instrumental to Maha. Like I said, they were Maha [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1071.3600000000001s)]
*  before that was even coined as a term. And I'm not knocking Nicole whatsoever, but it is convenient [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1075.92s)]
*  that she has a new contract with the Blaze and her new show she's promoting. And now she's [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1081.1200000000001s)]
*  generating tons of media and press off of this when she kind of hasn't had anything to do with [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1085.36s)]
*  HHS since January 20th at the inauguration. Here she is speaking of her show with on the Blaze. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1090.24s)]
*  She gave an interview to Glenn Beck yesterday following up on this tweet. And here's what she [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1096.08s)]
*  said. Maha had had, you know, any movement. Maha had this issue too, of infiltration by different [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1099.1999999999998s)]
*  groups that are more self-serving than they are for the movement itself. And so just one example, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1107.76s)]
*  Casey Means is a founder of a company that does biometric harvesting. She's very close [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1117.68s)]
*  with many of the big data biometric harvesting companies in Silicon Valley. And this, I know [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1126.3200000000002s)]
*  several of these people, you do not want them running in a government position that is responsible [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1135.04s)]
*  for everybody equally. Our job is to continue to seek the best possible people for government that [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1140.32s)]
*  are truly putting the principles of this country first, the principles of American sovereignty [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1147.76s)]
*  first. Thoughts on that? So I want to tell you what I told Nicole last year. Nicole ended up [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1154.8799999999999s)]
*  buying a house five minutes from me, five minutes from where I sit right now. We went to dinner a [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1163.52s)]
*  few times. We've hung out a few times. She was very open about her miscarriage. I remember being at [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1167.68s)]
*  the house and her telling me she was pregnant with her partner, Jacob. It was a beautiful moment. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1171.84s)]
*  But for Nicole, I told her last year, if you are passionate about staffing or certain people you [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1176.24s)]
*  want in the administration, call Trump's scheduler and set up a lunch or a meeting. Fly to Mar-a-Lago [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1181.76s)]
*  and go have dinner with them on the patio and say, here are some names I think you should consider. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1187.36s)]
*  Even right now, if she's upset, it's fine that she's at home tweeting. I'm happy she has a strong [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1191.36s)]
*  Wi-Fi connection. Set up a dinner. Trump will meet with you. President Trump is the most accessible [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1195.6s)]
*  president. He wants to hear from a wide range of people and make decisions that way. So if Nicole [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1200.1599999999999s)]
*  is so passionate and worried about these things, sitting at home tweeting isn't going to change it. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1204.8799999999999s)]
*  Hop on a flight. I told her that last year, last fall, go talk to President Trump. Go talk to Suzy [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1209.28s)]
*  Wiles. Go talk to Sergio Gore, who's in charge of personnel. But it's easy to sit at home and tweet. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1214.8s)]
*  It's a lot harder to get in the arena and actually make change. It's easier to sit at home and write [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1219.28s)]
*  checks than to get in there and do it. I have not seen her sit, get on a plane and go see President [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1223.52s)]
*  Trump. And it's now been 12 months. So I thought it was good advice. He would so meet with her. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1228.24s)]
*  He would so meet with her. I told her that during the nominations. I said, if you want to be part [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1233.92s)]
*  of this administration, the train's moving along without you. You probably aren't going to be part [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1237.76s)]
*  of it. If you don't go, set up lunch at Mar-a-Lago. Go meet with them. Every other business leader and [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1241.76s)]
*  wealthy person was flying to Mar-a-Lago after November 5th. Heads of state were flying to [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1247.04s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago. I know people might not remember. Zuckerberg was flying to Mar-a-Lago. I told Nicole, [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1251.44s)]
*  the train's going to leave you behind. Hop on a plane. Hop on a plane and go see the guy and [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1256.08s)]
*  plead your case of who you want. That has yet to happen. So we're tweeting. Well, here's the thing. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1260.8799999999999s)]
*  So you're right. Bobby Kennedy is at the heart of Maha. I mean, he's been living Maha for decades [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1264.8s)]
*  without it having that name. And that's the whole reason he threw his hat into the presidential [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1270.96s)]
*  ring. Not the whole reason. He's got a lot of issues with how government is being run. Things [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1275.84s)]
*  like the military industrial complex too bother him. He's got a lot of great issues that resonate, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1279.4399999999998s)]
*  but this is at the core of how he's lived his life as an environmental lawyer. But what happened with [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1284.32s)]
*  Maha, to my memory, I'm sure people will correct me, but what happened with Maha was Bobby was [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1289.04s)]
*  running his race. Then he got kicked out of the Democratic party and he obviously wasn't going to [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1296.0s)]
*  win that nomination. And there was a question about whether he was going to endorse Kamala or [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1300.96s)]
*  Trump. And the Kamala team turned their back on him. They were so stupid and short-sighted, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1306.88s)]
*  they wouldn't even talk to him. But he has this huge contingent of people who really connected [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1313.2s)]
*  with him. And Trump was like, yes, I will talk to you. So that happened. And at the same time, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1318.08s)]
*  Tucker had on Casey and Callie Means together. And it was an episode that went totally viral. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1324.16s)]
*  She's sold 1.5 million copies of this book, which is huge. She wrote it, but with Callie's help. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1332.0s)]
*  And he's a similar crusader in that he worked for Coca-Cola and then he kind of became like [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1340.64s)]
*  a whistleblower on how these industries corrupt us. And they worked together to get RFKJ [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1345.6000000000001s)]
*  to endorse Trump and Tucker was part of it. And the next thing we knew he did, [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1353.92s)]
*  that partnership was born. And when they did that dual announcement, refresh my memory if I'm wrong, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1360.32s)]
*  Link, but that's where they coined the phrase, make America healthy again. When their partnership, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1364.0s)]
*  Trump and Kennedy came together and the Means were in on it. And so they're right at the center of [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1369.44s)]
*  Maha. They're not satellite to it. They're not Johnny-come-lately's to it. They've been [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1375.92s)]
*  pushing this from long before Tucker found them. That's all these years of experiences are in good [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1382.32s)]
*  energy, the book. So it makes perfect sense to me why Bobby Kennedy would trust them and say, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1388.8s)]
*  this is the person to be the spokesman for what we're doing. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1394.64s)]
*  Absolutely. I think Maha was coined at the arena in Glendale back in August of 2024. I mean, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1398.56s)]
*  one of the most iconic political moments in history and shout out to President Trump's team [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1403.52s)]
*  for putting that together with the fire and the pyrotechnics and the Foo Fighters music. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1408.48s)]
*  I mean, that is going to go down in history. I love production value. Trump is the consummate [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1412.72s)]
*  producer. But yeah, this Maha Civil War to me is just so silly because we all want the same things. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1418.0800000000002s)]
*  We want healthy kids. We want chemicals out of our food. We want people eating less ultra processed [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1423.2800000000002s)]
*  foods. We all want the same things. So stop tweeting, pick up the phone and call each other, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1428.8000000000002s)]
*  you adults. Hop on planes and go have meetings with each other. Why have I been saying this [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1433.44s)]
*  now for over a year? But yeah, no, Cali has been at the forefront and Casey as well of Maha. I spoke [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1438.16s)]
*  to Cali about this when I interviewed him before we went on air. I said, you and I go back to way [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1443.6000000000001s)]
*  before Maha days. We were in group text and on emails during the campaign when he was advising [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1447.92s)]
*  our campaign. Well before Make America Healthy Again was coined, trademarked, copyrighted, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1452.64s)]
*  all of that. So to say that they should not be a part of the administration as conduits for Maha, [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1457.76s)]
*  I think is just really silly. And this isn't a knock to Nicole. Nicole and I forged a friendship. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1462.8000000000002s)]
*  I like Nicole. I am much closer to Bobby. I spoke to him a few weeks ago about family and some other [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1467.28s)]
*  things. I'm close with some of his kids. Just got dinner with one of his kids a few weeks ago as well. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1472.0s)]
*  I love Bobby. He changed my life working on that campaign. I don't think people understand. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1476.32s)]
*  I was making videos about the campaign and their head of tele fundraising called and said, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1481.12s)]
*  do you want to come out to the house on June 23rd in LA and meet Bobby? I said, I'm going to be in [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1484.96s)]
*  LA. I wasn't. I lied. So no, they really changed my entire life. And for that reason, I have nothing [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1489.36s)]
*  but kind words to say. And there's no one else who could be in Bobby's position or Casey's and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1495.92s)]
*  Callie's and take the hits and keep going because they're so strong in their convictions. You'd be [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1501.44s)]
*  hard pressed to find someone. That's how Doug Brunt, my husband, met me too. We were set up on [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1505.76s)]
*  a blind date. And when we had our first call about like whether we'd go out or we'd meet for a drink, [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1512.0s)]
*  he was living in New York and I was living in DC. And he said, oh, I'm going to be in DC, you know, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1516.8000000000002s)]
*  next weekend or two weekends. And of course, that was a lie. He just came down to see me and it worked [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1521.44s)]
*  out. No, this is my advice to all young people. This is what I tell young people all the time. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1525.6s)]
*  Show up. I don't care if you have to fly in the back of economy, if you have to stay in a crappy [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1530.0s)]
*  hotel, if there's a potential for a job or to level up in your career, show up. I said, of course, [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1533.76s)]
*  I'm going to be in LA on that date. They gave me an address. I Ubered over to the house. Security [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1539.76s)]
*  patted me down. They introduced me to Bobby. He gave me a cell number and said, my social media [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1544.08s)]
*  is F'ed. We need help with our social media. And I started texting him, you know, every couple of [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1548.7199999999998s)]
*  days with ideas. I put together little strategy memos. I would just email unsolicited. And finally, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1553.68s)]
*  his daughter-in-law called and said, well, I guess we should hire you to work on the campaign. And [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1558.72s)]
*  the rest is history. So show up people, show up young people. I couldn't agree more with that. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1563.2s)]
*  You either have that attitude or you don't. Like I'm now been at this job for, I don't know, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1567.52s)]
*  I've been in the professional working arena for longer than I care to say, actually, if I start [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1571.52s)]
*  doing math, I can count on like two fingers link the number of times I have not gone to work. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1575.2s)]
*  I literally have to be actively in the middle of vomiting to not show up. It's just who I am. I will [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1582.3200000000002s)]
*  crawl over hot coals to get to do my job because I just feel like that's the commitment that I've [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1588.48s)]
*  made. And by the way, even that presidential debate where Donald Trump and I tussled, I'd been [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1593.8400000000001s)]
*  violently vomiting all day long. I mean it, which is why, I mean, this is probably not great for me [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1600.24s)]
*  as a boss, but I don't have such an employee right now, just for the record. But if I had somebody [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1606.72s)]
*  who was like constantly calling out sick or like, oh, I can't be there or don't know, I can't make [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1611.6s)]
*  it, I'd get rid of them. It's like, I'm sorry, but like either you have this crusher work ethic [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1615.12s)]
*  or you don't. And I'm not in a job where that can even be abused. Journalism, it's not like, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1621.28s)]
*  well, I'll take all 24 of your hours, all of them. This is like, at worst you're going to be giving [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1625.9199999999998s)]
*  like nine hours, like shut up and do it. Sorry, that's how I feel. Well, that's what happened [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1631.4399999999998s)]
*  with the White House too. I said, you know, I don't have a press pass. I don't know if I can get in. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1637.52s)]
*  And my friends at the White House, they said, just show up. Showing up is half the job. I showed up, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1641.52s)]
*  had no idea what was going to happen that day. I said, you think there's a chance I could be [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1645.84s)]
*  included in this event? Let me see. Yeah, you can be included. Then I got to talk to President Trump [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1649.92s)]
*  and ask him a question. That's where the magic happens. Show up and go on that blind faith and [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1654.6399999999999s)]
*  work your ass off. All the young people listening and all the moms, tell your kids, okay? Show up. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1658.96s)]
*  Yes. Wait, so that's the one where he was like, I don't know who the hell is this guy, but I love him. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1662.8799999999999s)]
*  Exactly. There was a really small group that was going to be covering that NASCAR event [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1667.44s)]
*  and I went in and I said, I have no idea what the difference is between this pool and this press pool [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1671.36s)]
*  or the swimming pool, but if you guys would include me, I would be honored to be included. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1676.24s)]
*  I'm so grateful. It's an auspicious place. I don't take it for granted being here. The woman in the [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1680.6399999999999s)]
*  office said, let me go check. She comes back and says, yeah, you can come and be included in that [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1685.6s)]
*  event. So there are probably six or seven of us and President Trump came walking out and he kept [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1689.6799999999998s)]
*  looking at me. I think President Trump thought I was going to be some super liberal he was going [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1694.3999999999999s)]
*  to spar with. He was sort of looking at me going, oh, I'm going to eat this guy alive. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1698.0s)]
*  And then he ended up liking me and said, I love this guy. Who the hell are you? And so that is [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1702.08s)]
*  where the magic happens. Show up people, even if you're not actually going to be their lie. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1706.32s)]
*  Before he knows your name very, very well. So let's talk about you a little bit. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1711.36s)]
*  I think he does now. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1714.96s)]
*  I want to hear more about how Linkloren came into this world and was raised [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1716.4s)]
*  and how you got to be conservative. So talk to us about your background. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1721.12s)]
*  So it's interesting. I think people have this narrative that I was somehow super liberal and [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1726.3999999999999s)]
*  then I switched over the last few years and made a hard right turn. That's really not the case. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1730.24s)]
*  I grew up in Dallas, Texas. I went to an all boys school where we wore uniforms. It was a very [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1734.9599999999998s)]
*  conservative environment, but growing up, I was always super involved in politics. From the time [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1739.28s)]
*  I was 14, I would put together these town halls with kids from different schools in our area. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1744.24s)]
*  And we would talk about hot button issues, gender, race, news items that were going on. And I'd get a [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1749.12s)]
*  chaperone. I get pizza. I collect money for the pizza and kids would come once a month and we [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1754.32s)]
*  would discuss these issues. From there, I got invited to go to all these leadership conferences [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1758.32s)]
*  in high school. I got to go to DC and speak on Capitol Hill to advocate for some of the issues [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1762.6399999999999s)]
*  in my hometown. Kids who weren't getting accommodations, they were promised. Cause any [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1767.52s)]
*  parent out there who has a kid with special needs or learning disabilities, the public schools might [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1771.04s)]
*  not have the resources, the private schools, they aren't obligated to help you in any way. [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1775.4399999999998s)]
*  So I was in DC advocating for that as a teenager. And then I decided for some dumb reason to go to [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1779.04s)]
*  NYU. So I wanted to move to New York because there weren't a lot of people like me. I knew one other [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1785.2s)]
*  gay person. I just wanted to go to New York and I loved New York and grew up watching any shows I [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1791.76s)]
*  could about New York. So I went to NYU and it was a super liberal environment. Like the teachers are [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1796.3999999999999s)]
*  wearing Birkenstocks with rainbow leggings, utter calamity. Just so people know, Barron Trump is [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1802.1599999999999s)]
*  going through this same experience right now. Keep going. Yes. One of my biggest videos, part of the [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1807.68s)]
*  reason some of the Trump people started following me, I did a video last year on Barron going to [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1812.64s)]
*  NYU and some advice I had for him and it went bonkers. So I pray for Barron every single day [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1816.16s)]
*  at NYU, but I think he's a pretty strong kid. So NYU, I worked all through there. I was an assistant [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1821.44s)]
*  to someone in the music industry and he would have like Bon Jovi come over for dinner. I remember [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1827.44s)]
*  Valerie from Ashford and Simpson came over and would play piano and sing. And so I was always [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1832.16s)]
*  working as an assistant, fetching coffee, making copies, then going to class during the day. And [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1836.64s)]
*  then COVID hit and my degree was useless. I studied music business, entertainment. I studied a little [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1842.3200000000002s)]
*  bit of entertainment law and there was no entertainment industry really during COVID. The [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1847.44s)]
*  music industry was dead and a lot of my friends had sort of moved home. They had fallen into [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1853.0400000000002s)]
*  bad habits and there was this app called TikTok. So I was not going to do those silly dances on [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1857.92s)]
*  TikTok. That would be social suicide. I decided to start posting about politics and news and I did [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1863.6799999999998s)]
*  that and then in May of 2023 is when my video started to take off. In June of 2023, the Kennedy [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1869.1999999999998s)]
*  campaign said, we see these videos you're doing on the campaign. How can we get a list of the people [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1875.28s)]
*  who are commenting? I said, there's no way to export a list of these people who are commenting [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1879.9199999999998s)]
*  because young people were saying, who the heck is this RFK guy? Is he JFK Jr.? Who is this? They [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1884.32s)]
*  didn't really know. And the campaign said, we want to capitalize on that. And I said, well, why don't [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1889.04s)]
*  I film something with Bobby and do a whole thing on him? And that, you know, the rest is sort of [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1892.88s)]
*  history. Wow. So you, you lean more right because you grew up in Texas and are your parents [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1897.1200000000001s)]
*  conservative? How did, how did your politics get formed? So my mom is, my mom says she's an [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1902.8000000000002s)]
*  independent, which is code for, she loves Trump. But my dad is a conservative. My brother drives [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1908.16s)]
*  a big pickup truck and handles heavy machinery. And he's always now, now that I travel and I go [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1914.5600000000002s)]
*  to these events with hot conservative women, my brother's always like, got any babes? You set me up, [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1919.04s)]
*  hook your brother up, you know, tell him your brother with a truck wants a date. So yeah, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1923.52s)]
*  I did go probably a little more left when I went to NYU because it's all being shoved down [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1927.6s)]
*  your throat. And there wasn't a ton of alternative media. The podcast space wasn't really popping off [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1932.24s)]
*  at that time. Megan, you didn't even have your podcast yet. You weren't in the independent space. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1937.6s)]
*  Tucker wasn't in the independent space. And so I was basically consuming mainstream news and [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1941.52s)]
*  mainstream news. And my classmates at NYU said Trump is the boogeyman. Trump's going to destroy [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1945.52s)]
*  democracy. Hillary was robbed. You know, they're still crying over that night at the Javits Center. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1950.16s)]
*  And I just started looking around going, I don't know, this really isn't me. And then when my TikTok [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1955.12s)]
*  took off, I paid for myself. I flew to Iowa. I got on a bus and I went to all of these primary [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1960.24s)]
*  events. And that's how I connected with the Rama Swami campaign. I would show up at events. And I [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1965.44s)]
*  remember asking, you know, if Nikki Haley had 60 seconds to film a video with me, she said, no, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1969.28s)]
*  I would never film a TikTok. I remember waiting out in the hot sun at the Reagan Library for hours [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1973.44s)]
*  to film something with Pence because I was trying to get all the primary candidates. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1977.92s)]
*  Pence did not want to film with me, even though I submitted submitted questions ahead of time. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1980.88s)]
*  And they were softballs. And so I would just show up at events on my own dime, hoping to film a TikTok [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1984.88s)]
*  video. And at the time Trump wasn't on TikTok. They were like, this is the CCP. We're not going [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1990.4s)]
*  to film with you. And I would kind of just be shut out of events. And so when people say now I'm [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=1995.3600000000001s)]
*  gushing over Caroline Levitt at the White House, I'm not gushing over anyone. I'm just so grateful [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2000.08s)]
*  that new media is included at the White House because you guys don't know what it was like for me [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2004.56s)]
*  traveling through Iowa and New Hampshire and being shut out by comms directors and press secretaries [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2009.28s)]
*  who wouldn't let me film 60 seconds. I was doing millions of views a week on TikTok. Maybe you guys [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2014.24s)]
*  should have tried to reach my young people, Nikki Haley and Mike Pence. And so I just, that's why I'm [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2019.04s)]
*  so grateful for new media at the White House. You know, I'm not sycophantic. I really am that grateful [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2023.9199999999998s)]
*  to be there. I'm happy to be there. No, it's so stupid and short-sighted not to take advantage [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2029.12s)]
*  of this person who has a big presence on a very relevant, yes controversial, but very relevant app [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2033.36s)]
*  where millions of young Americans go religiously every day, multiple times a day. I mean, multiple [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2039.1999999999998s)]
*  times a day. So it's so short-sighted of them. In the month of May, when I really popped off was [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2047.36s)]
*  May of 2023, I did 32 million views on TikTok alone. That's over a million views a day. My [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2053.52s)]
*  videos were going crazy because I was the only one with really my perspective. Nobody who looked [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2058.4s)]
*  like me had my perspective. I was talking about men and women's sports, the immigration crisis, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2062.7200000000003s)]
*  East Palestine, Ohio, all of these things, the train derailment. Nobody looked like me was [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2068.2400000000002s)]
*  giving this perspective on TikTok. So my page was going crazy and I couldn't understand why folks [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2072.08s)]
*  like Pence and Haley and other primary candidates I won't name wouldn't even give me 30 seconds. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2077.12s)]
*  And I film with my phone. I pull out and ask them a fun silly question. For me, it's just getting [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2082.08s)]
*  them in front of my audience. A lot of my audience didn't know who Nikki Haley was, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2086.64s)]
*  so I couldn't understand them shutting me out when I'm doing more views a day. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2090.24s)]
*  Huge views in the Target demo that all these shows want. I am doing about a million views a day in [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2094.64s)]
*  the Target demo and you guys don't have 30 seconds for me. And I wish them well now. I think I'm doing [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2099.92s)]
*  okay. This is how I feel about TMZ. TMZ will catch up with me at random wherever sometimes [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2106.7999999999997s)]
*  I am. And I always talk to those guys. These are not bad guys. They're there. The shooter's [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2113.2s)]
*  going to get a couple of dollars if you give them some tape, answer a couple of questions. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2118.48s)]
*  If I were a politician and I saw some young guy just wanting to ask me who doesn't have a snarky [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2122.7200000000003s)]
*  way in, he's not being an asshole. Of course, that's the name of the game. That's why Trump [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2128.4s)]
*  will talk to anybody because he gets that. Absolutely. I would be in a suit and tie [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2134.0s)]
*  looking preppy. I was not there to cause any drama. I would get the emails of the press [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2138.72s)]
*  secretaries ahead of time and I would send my stats. Some of them would even say, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2144.0s)]
*  oh, we'll meet you here. And then they take one look at you and then they say, [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2147.9199999999996s)]
*  we're good. We're good. We're busy. And it was like, oh, does Mike Pence not want to be standing [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2151.6s)]
*  next to me on camera because I'm gay, because of the way I look? I have no clue. But I just [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2155.2s)]
*  remember being shut out of things. And it's funny now. That's why I'm so grateful and why I'm such [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2159.7599999999998s)]
*  a champion of new media because it was 18 months before Trump joined Tik Tok. So it was pretty [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2164.16s)]
*  cold desert out here. How was it? I mean, I've talked to a lot of gay conservatives. I feel like [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2168.7999999999997s)]
*  every gay conservative man is a friend of mine. I just feel like I know so many of them. We understand [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2173.92s)]
*  you. Well, I do. Well, as the guy who helps me with my costumes, because everybody knows I love [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2180.0s)]
*  my costume parties, as he said to Abby, behind every great woman is a strong gay man. I love that. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2185.12s)]
*  And I think it's true. But anyway, was it weird? Can you speak to what it was like? How old are you? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2193.52s)]
*  You're young. I'm 27 now. All right. So how is it? How was it growing up in that time frame as a gay [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2198.72s)]
*  man who leans conservative in Texas? Well, it wasn't even so much conservative. I mean, I was [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2205.2s)]
*  bullied relentlessly. When I say I was a loser growing up, I was never invited to a party. I [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2210.88s)]
*  would be at home on the weekends with my mom. I live with my mom. And so now it's such a effervescent [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2216.32s)]
*  personality. I know. Well, it's funny. Now I think people get me. But I think when kids are growing [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2222.48s)]
*  up, if you're a little different, they just don't know how to take you, right? They can't go throw [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2227.28s)]
*  the ball with you. They don't know, you know, how to take you. And so I was just bullied constantly. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2231.28s)]
*  I got the shit beat out of me. I had to have my front teeth redone. I had to get stitches. My car [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2235.52s)]
*  got vandalized. I was just bullied relentlessly. And I don't say, well, as me, I'm not looking for [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2239.92s)]
*  sympathy. I'm tough as nails. But it's just interesting now the past two years to be in such [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2244.64s)]
*  a great place. People say all the time, you're too happy. I was told by someone in conservative [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2249.92s)]
*  media, you're too cutesy and happy all the time. It's annoying. I am so happy to be here and to be [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2254.0s)]
*  working and that anyone likes what I do and to have a voice in the discourse at all. And so I'm [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2260.08s)]
*  never going to apologize for being eager and happy and excited because it's been a literal long hellish [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2265.6000000000004s)]
*  journey to get to the past two years. You know what I'm saying? Did you have like a natural, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2271.6000000000004s)]
*  sunny disposition before the bullying? Oh, I was always happy. I mean, I used to spike my hair and [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2276.56s)]
*  I was into theater and music and all of that. I always say- Pictures didn't happen. We'll lay [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2284.08s)]
*  them in after. Oh, I have tons of pictures. But yeah, no, I always say I'm a recovering theater kid. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2287.7599999999998s)]
*  But you know, I was always happy and fun. And what's so crazy is like, even though the kids [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2292.64s)]
*  would treat me like shit, I'd get like beat up on a Monday. I would come back to school on Tuesday [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2295.92s)]
*  and be like, can we help plan the spring fling dance? Can we do this? I was involved in community [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2299.36s)]
*  service. So I always tell kids literally get back up and keep going. You cannot stop. Right? And so [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2304.24s)]
*  it's why now I think a lot of these liberal journalists who are just, there's been a barrage [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2310.64s)]
*  of horrible hit pieces on me the last week and even one yesterday in the spectator, they were [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2315.7599999999998s)]
*  kind of coming for me. I think these journalists underestimate how comfortable I am in my own skin. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2321.2s)]
*  I am very secure and very confident in exactly who I am. Nothing a liberal journalist can say is ever [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2325.8399999999997s)]
*  going to knock me off my game whatsoever. Yeah, honestly. And they have absolutely no power over [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2332.56s)]
*  you. So you can relate to what I was saying at the top of the show that I witnessed in these young [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2338.16s)]
*  girls coming out to the microphone, you know, talented to the ears or working on it. It takes [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2342.32s)]
*  a lot of guts to do that to stand in front of a microphone or on a stage in front of your peers [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2349.04s)]
*  and just let it go. Like, let's see if they love me or hate me. Absolutely. I mean, I've gotten, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2355.2799999999997s)]
*  I got up to sing in front of the school a million times. I was in every show. I was the star of the [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2361.92s)]
*  choir. I was telling your producer in March of 22, I auditioned for this show at Carnegie Hall with [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2365.92s)]
*  Vanessa Williams. It was going to be sort of a Stephen, Stephen Sondheim retrospective in tribute [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2370.96s)]
*  and I ended up getting cast in the show. So I got to work with her. The show was sold out at Carnegie [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2375.36s)]
*  Hall. I was about to vomit before going out on stage, but I'm so glad I did it. So I can send in [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2379.6s)]
*  pictures of that as well. But yeah, no, it takes guts to get out there. Singing in said show. I [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2384.8s)]
*  want that too. Yeah, I will find, I will find. I'll go through my phone and I'll find all this [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2389.28s)]
*  and send it. But yeah, no, I think that's why now I'm not that nervous, especially the past few years [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2393.0400000000004s)]
*  getting to go on cable and go on shows. It's like, hello, I was in front of thousands of people about [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2396.96s)]
*  to vomit. This is fun. I can do this. But it does take guts. And I think it takes guts for young [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2402.0s)]
*  people to be authentic and stand in their truth, which sounds so Meghan Markle. I'm sounding so [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2406.8s)]
*  liberal and Meghan Markle right now, but it's just the truth, you know? And if you don't feel [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2411.1200000000003s)]
*  comfortable now, I always say the way you feel today, if you're watching this in your hometown, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2414.72s)]
*  if you're feeling left out, if you don't fit in, it's hard to see the forest for the trees when [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2419.3599999999997s)]
*  you're like a teenager. The way you feel today is not how you're going to feel forever. Okay? Your [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2422.9599999999996s)]
*  life is going to get exponentially better. Yeah. I mean, you forget that this is one of the things [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2427.04s)]
*  I love about you, Link, is that I feel like you take the important messaging that we have so much [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2432.16s)]
*  in common on and you bring it to a whole new generation. You resonate. I mean, I knew, I knew [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2437.52s)]
*  of you and you'd been on the show and you were a star and I was a big fan, but thank you. A [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2441.84s)]
*  friend's teenager, one of my dear friends, I was talking to her teenager and he was like, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2447.6800000000003s)]
*  you know who your favorite guest is of mine, Link Lauren. And he listed all the many reasons why he [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2452.48s)]
*  loves you. And it really was at that point that I was like, I actually needed seriously consider [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2457.52s)]
*  Link because for this new thing that we were launching, because I really think you're the [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2462.0s)]
*  voice of like the next generation. You're going to be able to speak to these young people in a [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2466.32s)]
*  way that, you know, yours truly might not be able to talk or might not be able to like, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2470.4s)]
*  you've got something and you've kind of been through things that they've been through more [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2474.64s)]
*  recently. They need somebody like you. Thank you. Well, thank you for saying that. And I have a ton [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2478.56s)]
*  of dudes who follow me. Straight guys are always like, you're the only gay guy I like. Well, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2483.92s)]
*  thank you. So I mean, my audience really runs the gamut. And I always say the only thing I'm [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2488.32s)]
*  beholden to, the only thing I'm beholden to is common sense. I've never taken a dollar from the [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2492.8s)]
*  RNC or Trump, no matter what these journalists say, have never taken a dollar from the DNC, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2497.12s)]
*  not that they offered. I'm just beholden to common sense. And it just so happens right now, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2501.6s)]
*  Trump and his administration are on the 80% of all of these 80 20 issues. And President Trump [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2505.7599999999998s)]
*  is our strongest defense and bulwark against the woke insanity on the left. So I am going to come [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2511.44s)]
*  out and speak up. I don't want another Lake and Riley, Jocelyn and Gary situation. I don't want [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2516.88s)]
*  MS, MS 13 and gang members running a muck on the street like a Bray go Garcia, right? I don't want [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2521.04s)]
*  men and women's sports. If that makes me some right wing such and such, I don't give a rat's [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2526.24s)]
*  ass because I'm going to speak up for common sense. And there's a reason overwhelming majority [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2530.4799999999996s)]
*  of the country agrees with me on these issues. You and Cali means discussed. President Trump, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2534.7999999999997s)]
*  who you both, he knows him a bit and you've been following him for quite some time and had a funny [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2541.68s)]
*  moment. I want to play that side. It's number four. President Trump looks great. I mean, [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2546.4799999999996s)]
*  he looks younger than ever. President Trump looks amazing. President Trump is aging in reverse. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2552.24s)]
*  He's losing weight. Bobby put him on a carnivore diet. Well, his medical report came out. It was [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2556.24s)]
*  not listed. I'm actually not. We're in the White House and I'm just, I'm saying this for real. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2564.16s)]
*  His biomarkers, his, his cholesterol and blood sugar and all those levels is top 5% for American [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2569.68s)]
*  age. He's lost weight. So, so, so it's common sense solutions. President Trump's cut out some [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2576.3199999999997s)]
*  carbs. He's eating more whole food. I mean, there's a real revolution happening in this country. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2581.12s)]
*  That's A, charming B, big news and C going to come as a crushing blow to the left. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2587.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh, Trump looks so good. Trump I really think is like Benjamin Button. He is aging in reverse. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2593.3599999999997s)]
*  I also have this theory that these woke liberals, they look so gaunt and gray and emaciated and [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2599.44s)]
*  anemic. These liberals who have Trump deranged- Like Vera Wang? [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2605.04s)]
*  Yes, like Vera Wang. They do not look healthy. And I know I'm the last person to talk about being pale [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2608.08s)]
*  because I'm white as Casper, but I will say these liberals literally are just, their cheeks are [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2612.56s)]
*  hollowing out. Well, that might be the, you know, buckle fat removal, but no, these liberal TDS [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2618.0s)]
*  celebrities, they don't look good. They look gray. President Trump, he looks friendly and vibrant [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2622.8s)]
*  and avuncular to use an SAT word. Everybody in the Trump administration is glowing and healthy. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2628.8s)]
*  And on the left, it's not great. They need maha. President Trump has definitely lost some weight. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2634.24s)]
*  He's slimming down and I'm glad to hear that Bobby Kennedy stepped in with a carnivore diet. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2638.3999999999996s)]
*  That's something president Trump could get behind. I don't see him going vegan, [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2642.7999999999997s)]
*  but I can see him going like, maybe we can have him switching to like the Big Mac without the buns. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2645.9199999999996s)]
*  Like that could be real progress. I think. Oh, that's a tough one. Not sure that would be [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2650.64s)]
*  Bobby approved, but that was great. And then you asked Callie about something very much in the news [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2654.56s)]
*  because of the controversy around his sister Casey, not knowing that this was about to hit, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2658.3999999999996s)]
*  but you got into the pushing of trans on our children and Callie and Casey are very close. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2663.2s)]
*  I told the audience this yesterday. I've spoken to Casey directly. Casey is where I am on the [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2670.72s)]
*  children and the trans thing. She will not push puberty blockers. She doesn't back. She doesn't [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2676.3999999999996s)]
*  believe in them for children. She doesn't believe in cross-sex hormones. She doesn't believe in [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2680.96s)]
*  surgical procedures in the trans lane for minors because she's a normal person. Okay. And neither [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2685.52s)]
*  does Callie. You and he discussed it a bit in South three kids transitioning. And I've talked [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2692.16s)]
*  about that a lot because people say you're gay. You should support kids transitioning. I'm gay, [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2697.2799999999997s)]
*  not brain dead. I have common sense. Is there a medical lobby pushing kids to transition and [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2701.68s)]
*  take these drugs and these gender hormones? Unrelenting. Okay. Unrelenting. So I think you [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2707.2s)]
*  have to understand that the blob of special interests looks for issues where you can call [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2712.8799999999997s)]
*  someone racist, homophobic, transphobic, sexist, what have you. They love those issues. And this [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2721.36s)]
*  child trans issue was a beautiful one. These institutions just lose their way. And at the core [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2730.8s)]
*  of this berating of the American people to support gender transition or else was a lot of corporate [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2738.0s)]
*  money because there are billions and billions of dollars. President Trump has just been stop it. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2746.1600000000003s)]
*  We're going to have common sense. And he's called it demonic in the past too. So this is all by the [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2750.4s)]
*  way, so that for the listening audience going to premiere on links, premiere episode is part of the [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2756.96s)]
*  MK media network. Go subscribe now wherever you get your podcast for free. It's called spot on with [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2761.6s)]

*  the YouTube and all that. But what did you make of Callie and even the notion that frankly, either [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2772.4s)]
*  Callie or Casey is pro the trans thing of children. So first off, I'm incredibly grateful to the [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2778.72s)]
*  White House and their entire team for setting this up. I do not take it for granted being there. And [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2784.72s)]
*  I thank you guys for helping me get the videographer because like I said, I barely know anyone in this [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2789.4399999999996s)]
*  business. So I was grateful to be there. I didn't know I was interviewing Callie until he showed up [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2793.52s)]
*  and was coming down the hall. And he said, Hey, I got 10 minutes. Let's do an interview. And I said, [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2798.08s)]
*  great, because I'm in the sea of all these new people and a high stakes environment. I haven't [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2802.56s)]
*  slept. I'm nervous. So seeing a familiar face and someone you're friends with coming down the [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2806.56s)]
*  hall made me so happy. I love Callie. I know I could pick up the phone and call him and say, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2810.4s)]
*  I need your advice on this and that health issue. And he would be there. I know the character [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2814.56s)]
*  of these people. And I can tell you with unequivocal certainty, they do not support the trans thing of [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2819.12s)]
*  kids whatsoever. They are with me on that. They're with you on that. They're on the 80% of this 80 20 [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2824.08s)]

*  the clip. Here is the other thing we talked about your we began the hour with my daughter on the [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2834.64s)]
*  stage and our little schoolmates on stage. We talked a bit about your acting background. We didn't [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2840.24s)]
*  talk about your latest starring role. Here's a bit for people who missed link, which I know none of [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2845.68s)]
*  you did in the blonde origin world. One week ago today, here he is. Watch. I just spoke to a source [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2850.64s)]
*  in Connecticut that said Megan's husband Douglas Brunt just took out a massive life insurance policy [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2859.52s)]
*  on her this morning. But I'm sure that is not suspicious whatsoever. These three women are [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2864.4s)]
*  proving once and for all, there's nothing a woman can't do that a man can as long as it's for a few [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2868.56s)]
*  minutes and they don't have to operate any heavy machinery. What is this meant to you as someone [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2873.52s)]
*  who's covered space launches for, I don't know, 20 minutes. I am just overcome with emotion. I am [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2877.52s)]
*  incredibly proud of these three women for everything they went to and the lead up to the launch for [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2884.4s)]
*  surviving zero gravity and making it back down to earth safe and sound. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2889.04s)]
*  Link, you nailed it. You made that so much funnier. And then we talked about it last [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2899.6s)]
*  Friday. If you haven't seen blonde origin, everybody go to youtube.com slash maybe telling [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2904.64s)]
*  it's still there. What was it like for you starring in your latest film? [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2908.32s)]
*  Oh, I was sick as a dog. I look terrible and we have nothing on the screen. So Mark and I [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2911.92s)]
*  were just kind of going for it. I think your team, they were like, oh, links not in the zone [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2918.96s)]
*  today. But I think we got some good lines. I had some other jokes that were probably a little more [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2922.88s)]
*  off color that my boyfriend said, you can't do that. You can't say that. I said, I think Megan [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2927.04s)]
*  would like it, but you know, I'll play it safe till the show launches. But yeah, I'm grateful to be [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2931.2s)]

*  audience you are not done with this amazing acting team. Yes, we're all world class actors now. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2950.16s)]
*  From Maureen and Sarah to link and Mark, I think we are all on board for a part two. The only [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2956.0s)]

*  trouble is just beginning. If you miss the April 15th deadline or still owe back taxes, the IRS [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2991.4399999999996s)]
*  is ramping up enforcement. You should know every day you wait might make things worse. With over [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=2998.16s)]
*  5,000 new tax liens filed daily and tools like property seizures, bank levies and wage garnishments, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3004.4s)]
*  the IRS is applying pressure at levels we haven't seen in years. The good news, there is still time [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3010.7999999999997s)]
*  for Tax Network USA to help self employed or a business owner. Even if your books are a mess, [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3016.0s)]

*  April 15th, but you haven't run out of options. Let Tax Network USA help before the IRS makes [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3047.6s)]
*  the next move. Let's talk about the Pope for a minute because we've learned a lot about our [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3053.7599999999998s)]
*  newly elected Pope since this time yesterday when the news broke. He was Cardinal Robert Francis [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3059.8399999999997s)]
*  provost and now he's Pope Leo the 14th. And he's from Chicago. He's born in Chicago as I was calling [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3065.6s)]
*  him yesterday online, the Pope. Kind of fun from Chicago like the bears. And then he went, he was [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3072.72s)]
*  sent by Pope Francis over to Peru. I think it was Pope Francis and I, but the Pope at the time sent [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3083.12s)]
*  him over to Peru where he spent a long time and he actually became a dual citizen of America and [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3088.96s)]
*  Peru. And then he wasn't made a Cardinal until 2023, but he's then since then been the guy in [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3093.12s)]
*  charge of like finding new bishops and elevating priests up to the bishop position. So obviously [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3100.0s)]
*  he had some friends inside the conclave and it worked for him yesterday. Now we had somebody [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3106.0s)]
*  from the Catholic channel join us and he was saying no one really, almost no one was predicting [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3113.6800000000003s)]
*  that this would be the guy. And that really is true. And if you look back at the articles, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3118.64s)]
*  like leading up to this, he was not mentioned by virtually anybody except these two people. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3122.7200000000003s)]
*  The first one that I want to show you is the man who conducted the christening [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3130.3999999999996s)]
*  of all three of my children, Father Jonathan Morris, who later left the priesthood. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3137.6s)]
*  And now instead of calling him FJ, we have to call him FFJ as in former Father Jonathan. But he says [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3144.48s)]
*  my kids' christenings are still legit. They still count. But here he was three days before the [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3150.48s)]
*  conclave in Rome. We're talking about Papabile, the next, the candidates to be the next pope. [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3157.44s)]
*  And today I would like to talk to you about two American names who are actually in the mix, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3164.96s)]
*  which has not really been the case in recent conclaves. The first one, you might not know him, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3170.2400000000002s)]
*  his name is Robert Prevost, P-R-E-V-O-S-T. He's an Augustinian priest. So he's part of a religious [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3176.56s)]
*  order who was called by Pope Francis to Rome in just 2023 to be a head of a very powerful [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3184.72s)]
*  department of the Vatican in charge of naming bishops or proposing to the pope names of bishops [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3193.12s)]
*  throughout the world. But he's really an enigma to many, not only cardinals, but American cardinals. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3200.8799999999997s)]
*  That's because although he's from Chicago, 69 years old, he spent most of his life outside [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3207.9199999999996s)]
*  of the United States as a missionary and then as a missionary bishop in Peru. Certainly he's in [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3213.6s)]
*  line with Pope Francis or at least Pope Francis was convinced of that because he called to take [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3221.04s)]
*  over a very important department, but he's also known as a pragmatist. Okay, one more credit where [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3227.52s)]
*  it's due. Piers Morgan had Steve Bannon. Steve Bannon, he's predicted so much accurately on his [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3235.36s)]
*  show a week ago and here's Steve Bannon. I do think one of the dark horses, and I think, [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3244.1600000000003s)]
*  unfortunately, he's one of the most progressive, is Cardinal Prevost. I don't think he's getting [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3249.6s)]
*  enough play. He's certainly on the short list. Prevost is one of the ones closest to Francis [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3253.52s)]
*  ideologically. He's also had tremendous experience in Latin America and so he's one of the ones on [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3258.6400000000003s)]
*  the short list. Steve Bannon is the bomb. I mean, it's one thing for FFJ to know it because that's [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3264.08s)]
*  his business. He still knows the church so well, but Steve Bannon, he's got his finger on the pulse. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3270.08s)]
*  Anyway, what do you make of it? Because there's been a bunch of reporting about [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3274.96s)]
*  this pope was, he voted in Republican primaries in Illinois and he is anti-transing of children [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3278.72s)]
*  and trans ideology. That seems clear from some of his tweets and remarks. He's, of course, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3285.7599999999998s)]
*  against abortion. He doesn't believe in gay marriage. These are not surprising things for [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3291.84s)]
*  the Catholic church, but, and he's pro migrant, doesn't surprise me either, but he has had [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3295.36s)]
*  five tweets or retweets in the past couple of years critical of either JD Vance Trump or Trump's [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3301.52s)]
*  immigration policies in particular. So what do you make of it? [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3307.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think he's allowed to retweet or tweet whatever he wants. He's the pope. He's going to [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3311.44s)]
*  be living over there. He's not involved in our politics. I can't wait to see a meeting with [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3317.76s)]
*  president Trump, JD Vance and the new pope prevost pre-boast. I'm sorry if I'm not pronouncing it [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3321.84s)]
*  correctly. Just call him Leo. Yeah, Leo. I love Leo. I think it's a funny, and I loved FFJ. I [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3326.8s)]
*  thought he looked great too. The green jacket, the full head of hair. It's like a Rogan ad. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3333.2000000000003s)]
*  He looked great and he knew to do the angle up. You always got to angle up, never down. He looked [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3337.5200000000004s)]
*  great. So yeah, no, I'm happy for new pope Leo, but like I said, I don't think we should really [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3341.5200000000004s)]
*  be bothered by some tweets he did. I think though it does speak to someone's whole entire ethos, [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3346.08s)]
*  though, if they are pro mass migration or if they're more staunch and tough on immigration, [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3350.4s)]
*  I think it does speak to a little bit of someone's character. But at the end of the day, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3355.52s)]
*  the guy's from Chicago, a very blue city. So even if he's a Chicago Republican, [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3358.96s)]
*  he might not be where we are right now with the Trump administration. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3363.84s)]
*  I think there's not going to be a pope who's not pro mass migration. Right. That's right. It's [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3367.52s)]
*  Catholicism. I mean, that's Catholicism. They're very pro migrant, you know, wash the feet of the [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3373.2s)]
*  poor and the hungry and those who need us. And, you know, we're a bunch of bleeding hearts at, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3380.16s)]
*  at, you know, bottom, unless if you're trans or gay, in which case, no, sorry, link. They love, [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3385.12s)]
*  they love gays and lesbians. They just don't want them to get married. [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3392.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, I was just speaking to the things I was seeing on X. I'm not saying that's how I [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3395.04s)]
*  personally feel. I'm just saying on X, the criticism seemed to be the retweets about [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3398.24s)]
*  immigration and Trump and JD Vance. But like I said, he's welcome to say whatever he wants. [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3401.84s)]
*  He's the pope, right? We're over here in the U S doing our own thing. I don't understand why [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3406.08s)]
*  people are so upset about his retweets, if that makes sense. Yes. Well, I think I can speak to [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3409.6800000000003s)]
*  this because as a Catholic in America, Pope Francis, God rest him, was very progressive and [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3414.6400000000003s)]
*  like kind of turned the church in a progressive direction and did some battle with America and [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3421.36s)]
*  our president for a while. And when it was Donald Trump, not, not when it really, when it was Joe [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3428.56s)]
*  Biden. And we didn't much like that. So it's great to see an American pope. And I actually [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3433.36s)]
*  have an open minded to this pope, notwithstanding those tweets. I really think even a conservative [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3439.04s)]
*  leaning pope could have sent out those tweets because I'm sorry, the Catholic church is very pro [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3442.48s)]
*  immigration. It's not my favorite thing, but it's the truth. So I don't think we know enough about [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3447.12s)]
*  him yet to know what kind of pope he will be. Now here's something fun though. He's from Chicago, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3452.64s)]
*  white, white socks, not cubs from what I read and his brother, John, he's got like a normal brother, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3459.52s)]
*  John provost, pre-vost living in Chicago still, who gave a presser yesterday to everybody who [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3467.52s)]
*  was knocking down his door and listen to him talking about his brother, Bob. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3474.7999999999997s)]
*  And you said you spoke to him right before Conclave. Tell me what that conversation was like. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3479.12s)]
*  Really? First we do wordle because this is a regular thing. Okay. Then we, we do words with [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3485.52s)]
*  friends. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world. And then we talk about what's [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3493.2s)]
*  going on. And I said, well, do you have your red socks? That doesn't go over well all the time. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3499.6s)]
*  And then just that kind of stuff. And I said, well, are you ready for this? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3505.2s)]
*  I said, did you watch the movie Conclave? So you know how to behave. [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3508.7999999999997s)]
*  And he had just finished watching the movie Conclave. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3512.56s)]
*  So he knew how to behave. So it's that kind of stuff. [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3517.12s)]
*  Amazing. He just finished watching the movie. I'm pretty sure this pope is not intersex. So [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3521.12s)]
*  we've done better than that ridiculous movie. But isn't that cool? It's like, you never think of the [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3526.24s)]
*  pope, you know, it's just being like a regular guy. He grew up Bob and that's his brother, John. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3531.04s)]
*  Having friends, family playing wordle. I love it. And I love that the brothers out there doing [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3537.2799999999997s)]
*  interviews and pressers on the front lawn. It's very like Thomas Markle, Samantha Markle. It's [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3542.08s)]
*  like, we're going to go to press and interviews too. Like our man made it. You guys, our guy made it. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3546.8s)]
*  We're going to go to, I'd be making the rounds if I were him. Okay. So I don't blame him at all for [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3551.44s)]
*  being on the front lawn. Think of the money he could make with just like baby pictures of the pope, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3555.84s)]
*  you know, or like the silly toddler videos that we all shoot now of our kids. I wonder if he's [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3560.16s)]
*  got some of Bob. I don't know. Maybe it's the fact that he's an American, you know, so all of these [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3564.3999999999996s)]
*  references are going to be familiar to us. He's going to have some of the same habits as we do. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3570.72s)]
*  I don't know. It's just kind of cool to think about because he's, you know, we believe he gets [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3576.3199999999997s)]
*  elevated by the Holy Spirit. And so Bob, the word lover who watches the same TV shows we do [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3579.92s)]
*  is now pope and leader of 1.4 billion Catholics across the globe. Very cool stuff. [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3586.72s)]
*  If Wirtle were smart, the word of the day would be like conclave or pope or something. If Wirtle [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3593.2799999999997s)]
*  were smart, they would do that anyway. Can it only be five letters? C-O-N-C-O. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3598.08s)]
*  Oh, is it only five? I don't play that. I never play Wirtle either. I know. Not with [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3601.4399999999996s)]
*  Sam. My kids play it. Okay. While we're on the subject of religion, did you watch the Met Gala [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3605.2s)]
*  at all on Monday? Megan, do you think I watched the Met Gala? Absolutely. It's required viewing. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3610.96s)]
*  Okay. I didn't know if you would watch. I thought maybe highlights. So, you know, Lisa, Lisa, who [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3617.52s)]
*  I only know this woman from White Lotus, but she also sings and is apparently very popular [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3625.76s)]
*  in the K-pop world, decided to wear underwear to the Met Gala and to put Rosa Parks' face on her [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3631.52s)]
*  underwear. It seems very clear. And then there was backlash because she's a civil rights icon [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3639.68s)]
*  and she's kind of one of the untouchables in American history. Like everybody's proud of Rosa [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3646.64s)]
*  Parks. Like it's just one of our icons who had absolutely no power and did this extraordinary [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3653.2s)]
*  thing. And the worst people have ever said about Rosa Parks is it was orchestrated and it was [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3658.3199999999997s)]
*  planned. Who cares? Still, I mean, amazing. She had no power. She's at the lowest end of the totem pole [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3661.7599999999998s)]
*  in the power structure. And she did this extraordinary thing on the bus. She doesn't [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3666.48s)]
*  really belong on anybody's vagina. It's just like it shouldn't be controversial. So and it should be [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3670.48s)]
*  known K-pop or not. So now in the wake of the backlash, her rep has come out to say, [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3675.36s)]
*  that's not Rosa Parks. That is the this artist who came up with her or the designer who came up with [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  her outfit. The designer's rep has come out to say this designer put his neighbor's face on Lisa's [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3690.48s)]
*  underwear. That's his neighbor, Link. It's not Rosa. Now look, we've done a scientific experiment. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3700.0s)]
*  We have zoomed in. Sorry, folks. This is very, very close up of Lisa's crotch. And there is Rosa [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3708.0s)]
*  on screen right now. And I'm sorry, but it's the same person. It's look where you can even see they [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3716.56s)]
*  did the part, the exact part in the exact part of the head as we see on Rosa. But they're denying it, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3721.2s)]
*  Link, because yeah, you know why. Well, maybe his neighbor was Rosa Parks. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3728.48s)]
*  I mean, when Rosa went from the back of the bus to the front, she didn't know she was going to end [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3737.2s)]
*  up on this Asian lady snatch at the Met Gala. I mean, how terrible is that? What the hell is [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3741.04s)]
*  going on? And when it comes to crisis management and PR, let me tell you, you are losing when you [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3746.24s)]
*  are explaining that it's not Rosa Parks on your vagina at the Met Gala. That is what you're losing. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3753.6s)]
*  If you're explaining, you are losing people. Listen to me. Okay. It's a good point. Yeah. I don't [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3758.7999999999997s)]
*  believe the designer's rep. One bit. I think it's Rosa Parks. The whole theme was black dandyism. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3764.24s)]
*  And you know what you did, Lisa. Lisa. Yeah. Well, I don't think Lisa did. She probably just [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3770.9599999999996s)]
*  put it on and was like, I don't know. I mean, I don't think Lisa even knew. She just put the outfit on. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3776.0s)]
*  Why would this K-pop lady know about Rosa Parks? Because the designer was like, Lisa, guess who I [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3780.0s)]
*  put on your underwear? And I bet you she was too dumb to realize that might be controversial. That's [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3785.36s)]
*  my bet. Okay. Sorry. Speaking of the Met Gala, there is fallout, other fallout. Rapper, Dochi, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3790.0s)]
*  no idea. It was very clear. I don't follow music that closely because I never heard of Lisa outside [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3798.0s)]
*  of White Lotus. Okay. So now this is Dochi. D-O-E-C-H-I-I. We know her on this show only as [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3802.32s)]
*  the weird lady who decided to put like a box around her as she walked from the hotel, the [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3810.96s)]
*  Mark Hotel, out like their little mini red carpet to get into her van to be taken over to the Met [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3817.36s)]
*  Gala. And she didn't want to be seen and she didn't want to be rained on. And she turned into a massive [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3822.8s)]
*  bully screaming at her staff. I need an umbrella. Here it is. Watch. [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3827.52s)]
*  Move this umbrella. I don't want to scribble on this thing. I got it. Move the umbrella. [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3857.52s)]
*  Oh my God. Right now. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3861.68s)]
*  Oh. I don't know what happened there at the end. Dochi's an angry person. I think we can safely [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3869.28s)]
*  conclude that. And now she's trying to play it down like something like, you know, well, [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3878.08s)]
*  when you need an umbrella, you need like, I'm sorry, but that doesn't do anything to quell [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3883.68s)]
*  my reaction. I think most people's reaction at what a bitch she was to her staff. And it's like [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3890.3199999999997s)]
*  over umbrella, right? Like it's not like, Oh my God, turns out I have an enormous hole in the back [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3895.12s)]
*  of my dress that shows my entire ass. Like I would yell like that. I would, but like, you know, [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3901.04s)]
*  get me another umbrella. Now. This is not a nice person. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3907.52s)]
*  I'll also say the unveiling of the Pope was less dramatic than that. Like who's in there? Who's [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3913.12s)]
*  going to come out? And then no one knows who the F you are. You know what I'm saying? Like remember [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3919.28s)]
*  we used to have big stars, Madonna, Michael Jackson, all these huge stars. It's like, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3923.6s)]
*  who's in there? Big reveal. It's Dochi. Who the fuck are you, Dochi? It's like, why do you need [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3928.4s)]
*  all this? It was a couple of drops of rain walk out to the car and they're going to take your [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3936.16s)]
*  picture 30 seconds later. I don't understand. They can't get your picture. You're at the market [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3940.3999999999996s)]
*  going to the Met Gala. These are self-important. I think you called them as well. Demonic celebrities. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3944.7999999999997s)]
*  They want to traipse up and down a staircase and $30,000 gowns. And then they preach and [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3950.7999999999997s)]
*  proselytize to us how to live our lives. So Dochi. Yeah. This is not really anything to write home [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3955.2799999999997s)]
*  about. This is what she, maybe the hair couldn't get wet. We might see for the listening audience. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3960.56s)]
*  It's weird little checkered shorts and a weird checkered top with like a bow tie. That's like [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3964.96s)]
*  the pussy bow that used to be in style a couple of years ago. And that's it. Like that's okay. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3972.88s)]
*  Great. Some sort of a cape as well. Foxy Cleopatra hair. I think that's maybe what couldn't get wet [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3978.48s)]
*  is the hair. I don't know, but we're getting, I don't know. Like, well, let's be honest. One [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3983.44s)]
*  umbrella will work over Dochi. The way it works over all of our hair. I don't need 20 umbrellas. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3988.08s)]
*  What is that moving Bob amoeba of people in the lobby? And by the way, half the stars came out of [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=3995.76s)]
*  the mark and everybody posed and let the photogs have a shot the way you wanted them to. Like [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4003.84s)]
*  everybody's PR agent would love to have a shot by the photogs here. And at the Met Gala, you get [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4011.04s)]
*  both. It's not going to be like, Oh, we blew it because we already saw it at the mark. I mean, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4016.0s)]
*  she's just, this woman's an idiot. So I love to see the fallout from the people over there because [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4019.2s)]
*  they're bad people. Okay. There's more. We've got to get to my favorite story of the day, which is [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4023.6000000000004s)]
*  Ilaria Baldwin. Ilaria Link. She's got a new book out. Okay. And she really, really wants us to get [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4029.76s)]
*  to know her better. It's called manual, not included. It came out this past Tuesday. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4037.6800000000003s)]
*  The cover shows Alec Baldwin with tape over his mouth in a box surrounded by the kids. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4043.1200000000003s)]
*  His daughter is holding the role of tape. So she talks about, among other things, [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4047.84s)]
*  the beginning of their relationship. Let's take a listen to that because she also did the audio [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4054.4s)]
*  book. For the first six weeks that we dated, Alec just wanted to talk. He would shake my hand. Hello [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4058.56s)]
*  and goodbye. Sometimes these early conversations were intense. It wasn't purely about physical [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4065.6000000000004s)]
*  attraction. It was true respect. No one had ever wanted to get to know me in quite that way before. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4071.2s)]
*  What's not funny is the cruelty from the tabloid media and online trolls who tried to diminish me, [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4078.7999999999997s)]
*  labeling me as a gold digging younger woman, someone who doesn't deserve to be with him. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4084.3199999999997s)]
*  I have given a lot of thought to why people want to label me as such. Here's my theory. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4089.3599999999997s)]
*  Please bear with me. If you're a successful gold digger, you have one kid spend a few years with [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4094.56s)]
*  your husband, then get out of the marriage and take all of his money. We have seen it modeled. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4101.12s)]
*  I can tell you that seven kids shouldn't be in the gold digging curriculum and I would probably [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4107.12s)]
*  receive like a solid D minus for this choice. Kids are expensive and a lot of hard work. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4111.68s)]
*  Gold diggers want maximum money and minimal responsibility. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4117.44s)]
*  Do you accept that definition? I'm over here taking notes. Wait, how do I be a gold digger? [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4123.84s)]
*  I don't think any of the Baldwin brothers are probably worth dating these days. First off, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4130.56s)]
*  Manuel not included, terrible name for a book. I don't know if that's what came with her vibrator [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4134.320000000001s)]
*  and her nightstand. Manuel not included, but I don't know why she needed that. Also, she is [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4138.96s)]
*  kind of a gold digger. She's also insane and has multiple personalities. For her to say she's not [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4144.0s)]
*  a gold digger, maybe you would have just met Alec Baldwin and fallen in love if he wasn't famous and [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4149.280000000001s)]
*  wealthy at the time, but I'm sure that was part of the calculus. I respect these women a whole lot [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4154.160000000001s)]
*  more if she would just admit it. Say, you know what? It was Alec Baldwin. I was trying to be [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4158.88s)]
*  this yoga Pilates influencer. I also love, and people go watch on YouTube if you're listening [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4163.2s)]
*  so you can see what we're talking about, he's smothered on the cover of the book. I think his [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4168.72s)]
*  mouth is taped and he's taped. This is really, I think if they go to divorce court, he has so [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4172.4800000000005s)]
*  much lined up to just show that she's a psycho woman. Why is he taped and trapped in like bondage [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4178.0s)]
*  on the cover of the book with all these kids? And it's because she's trapped him in this apartment [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4183.68s)]
*  with a million kids, dogs, nannies, and a camera crew and she hates him. So maybe this is his [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4187.76s)]
*  penance for shooting that woman on the set of that movie. God is like punishing him, but he looks [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4192.96s)]
*  trapped. These are Link's opinions, but they're well founded in my opinion. I think you're right about all of that. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4197.84s)]
*  I'm saying all this allegedly. Yes. It's allegedly, no, it's your opinion based on the way she's [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4204.0s)]
*  behaved and I share your opinion. This is a very strange woman. And on the gold digging front, I [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4208.64s)]
*  think she's wrong, first of all, because yes, if she left after one kid, he'd have to pay her [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4214.72s)]
*  child support. That wouldn't necessarily keep her in the same style that she's become accustomed to [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4219.84s)]
*  as his full-time wife and the mother of seven kids. And secondly, I actually don't know that [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4225.76s)]
*  it was all money driven. I'm pretty sure it was fame driven. Fame is a different form of gold. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4231.2s)]
*  And I think she was extremely attracted to that. And I think that's ongoing. You can't, as soon as [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4236.56s)]
*  you divorce Alec, the tabloids will follow you around for a year just to see if you say anything [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4241.12s)]
*  about Alec, but they have no actual independent interest in Hilaria Baldwin, none. And she knows [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4246.24s)]
*  that she's only interesting because she's his wife. And let's face it, he's one of the biggest [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4252.16s)]
*  stars in America. He is by the way, my favorite Baldwin is now Billy Baldwin, still like Steven, [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4256.08s)]
*  but it's Billy who came on the show last week on national fentanyl day. And unlike a lot of these [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4262.08s)]
*  other Hollywood stars, didn't turn up his nose at my audience, even though it has many conservatives, [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4268.48s)]
*  just because they're conservatives. So many assholes who are trying to promote some health [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4274.959999999999s)]
*  initiative will skip conservative media. They want conservatives to die. They don't care if their [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4279.759999999999s)]
*  kids get sick. It's messed up. So hats off to Billy Baldwin for being here. Okay, so back to Hilaria. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4286.16s)]
*  So I think she's a fame digger. It's a different kind of gold. That's my own personal belief on [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4293.44s)]
*  her. The best part of all this is she gets to the Spanish accent, the fake Spanish. She grew up in a [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4297.36s)]
*  Tony Boston suburb. Her name is Hillary. It's not Hilaria, as she wants us to believe. It's Hillary. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4306.32s)]
*  And she's as white as they come. She's not Spanish. And she was mocked mercilessly a few years ago [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4312.08s)]
*  during COVID for this clip that was on the Today Show where she pretended to forget how to say, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4320.639999999999s)]
*  in English, the word cucumber. She's American. She did not grow up in Spain. She's bilingual, [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4328.08s)]
*  but her native tongue is English. Remember this? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4334.08s)]
*  We have very few ingredients. We have tomatoes. We have, how do you say it in English? [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4337.04s)]
*  Cucumbers. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4343.04s)]
*  Cucumbers. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4343.599999999999s)]
*  How do you say in English? How do you say in English? Okay, so now she's attempting to explain [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4346.24s)]
*  this problem as follows. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4353.04s)]
*  Oh my God. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4413.04s)]
*  Oh my God. She's neurodivergent. It's her ADHD that made her not remember how to say cucumber [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4439.599999999999s)]
*  in English, Link. You buying it? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4448.96s)]
*  Well, in college, my advisor said I needed a minor. So I thought, what's the easiest thing I can do? [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4451.5199999999995s)]
*  So I minored in psychology. So in none of my courses, not in the DSM manual or anything, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4456.32s)]
*  none of my professors taught me that a side effect of ADHD and dyslexia is actually having fake [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4461.2s)]
*  accents and fake personalities. That was not ever in any of my curriculum. So, Elaria, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4466.24s)]
*  Hilaria, I don't know what is going on with her. She's kooky. They're just trying to make money [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4471.2s)]
*  because I think they're probably broke, right? She's doing a book. She's doing a reality show. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4475.679999999999s)]
*  And I know I just keep coming back to the cover of the book, you guys. You have to go Google it. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4479.92s)]
*  You've never seen a man more emasculated than he is on the cover of this book right now. I mean, [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4483.76s)]
*  his mouth is taped. He's wrapped up. She looks like she is totally in control running that household. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4488.719999999999s)]
*  And for her to say she's not a gold digger because she had what? 10,000 kids instead of one. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4495.12s)]
*  Maybe she could have Ashley St. Clair over for a crash course because Ashley St. Clair certainly [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4499.36s)]
*  did not learn that lesson. She should have sat there, shut her mouth and pumped out those Tesla [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4503.68s)]
*  babies in that apartment. But she threw it all away for an interview and a photo shoot with [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4507.68s)]
*  John Levine at the New York Post. So I think Ashley St. Clair should skedaddle on over to [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4511.44s)]
*  Elaria's apartment and get some notes from her. Here's the other thing she says in the same [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4515.5199999999995s)]
*  part of the book where she's talking about she's neurodivergent and that's why [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4522.16s)]
*  she forgets her English word for cucumber. I mean, first of all, just for now for nothing, [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4525.84s)]
*  but it's such an obvious lie because she there are multiple examples of Elaria talking in a fake [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4530.5599999999995s)]
*  Spanish accent. Like there she was in a fake Spanish accent and pretending to forget her English. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4537.2s)]
*  But we've run these clips ad nauseam on the show of her. Like, let me tell you something. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4543.5199999999995s)]
*  When this baby needs his mama, she's like, she's, I think she's from Weston, Massachusetts. She's [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4549.280000000001s)]
*  from like, it's not Western, it's one identical, which is literally one of the nicest suburbs [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4555.84s)]
*  in the world. She went to a private girl's school. She has the parents have tons of money. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4560.64s)]
*  She is as white as you or I are. And she was Hillary. She, she now I'm back to Elaria. No, [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4566.8s)]
*  you are not Elaria. That too is an affectation. So she writes in this passage. Okay. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4574.8s)]
*  Growing up being neurodivergent, you heard some of this there. I had to work harder in school [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4581.360000000001s)]
*  than any of the people around me. Now I know that it's ridiculous that anyone would feel outraged [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4584.4800000000005s)]
*  or amused because someone forgot a word. She says, but back then, and I think she's referencing the [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4588.56s)]
*  2020 controversy over cucumber. I started to really unravel. Yeah. Yeah, she was. I was confused. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4593.12s)]
*  I felt lost. I missed my family. I couldn't eat. I got very thin. I started to question my sanity. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4598.96s)]
*  Then she says, I wanted to be dead and I got worse and worse and worse. I took speech therapy to [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4605.92s)]
*  enunciate better. The more I got treatment for the ADHD that I was trying to ignore, the better I got [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4613.84s)]
*  at separating the two languages and not getting as distracted. I tried to improve myself in all the [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4620.88s)]
*  ways. And that's when Hilaria returned to her at the end of this. She appears to be suggesting [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4626.16s)]
*  that she wanted to kill herself over the cucumber controversy, over the fact that she wanted to [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4630.88s)]
*  enunciate better. That's very strange because as I say, there is a string of tape of her continuing [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4638.4s)]
*  to pretend she's Spanish. And there's a tape of Alec Baldwin on one of the late night shows saying, [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4645.04s)]
*  my wife, she's from Spain. And then he imitates her Spanish accent. You're like, these two have [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4651.04s)]
*  been lying about this weird fake origin story for years. I mean, maybe she just forgot the word [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4656.4800000000005s)]
*  cucumber because she's not all that bright and all that smart. Or maybe she's had a thousand kids. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4663.28s)]
*  She bumped her head on the headboard too many times and she's concussed. I don't know why she [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4668.08s)]
*  forgot the word cucumber, but nonetheless, Hilaria Baldwin, she's just such a spiritual, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4672.08s)]
*  smart woman. Maybe she can broker the Maha peace deal in this Maha civil war right now. She's just [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4677.2s)]
*  such mother of the earth. But no, I have no respect for Hilaria Baldwin. I think she's crazy. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4681.92s)]
*  It's really sad too, because Alec Baldwin was this handsome masculine, one of the last masculine, [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4686.5599999999995s)]
*  give zero Fs kind of guys, punching paparazzi. I watched It's Complicated on a Plane a few weeks [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4692.64s)]
*  ago. Alec Baldwin is so my type. But when you see him like this, emasculated and degraded, it's a no. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4698.16s)]
*  I know. I agree. He could have a comeback. He needs to lose 30 pounds and shave. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4705.28s)]
*  If he got his eyes done and shaved. Oh, come back. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4710.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. And a divorce, obviously. Here she speaks to what happened with the death of [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4714.56s)]
*  Helena Hutchins, the cinematographer who Alec killed on set of The Rust movie in A Mistake, [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4721.12s)]
*  where he says he didn't fire the gun, but the experts all say that gun wouldn't have fired [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4727.6s)]
*  if he hadn't pulled the trigger. But he wasn't trying to kill her. There's no dispute. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4731.2s)]
*  No. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4733.92s)]
*  It was a terrible tragedy, an accident on the set. In any event, she died. And listen to this [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4734.24s)]
*  weird take on the aftermath of that. See if it jumps out at you as it did to us. Saat 25. [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4740.88s)]
*  Have you ever ignored a call coming in from your husband? I did on October 21st, 2021. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4748.08s)]
*  Actually, it was two calls. At that time, Marie Lu was my youngest and I was taking photos of her. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4755.12s)]
*  The phone rang and I ignored it. I'm doing something right now, I thought. Then Alec called [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4761.28s)]
*  again, which he often would do when he had a break from filming. We had already spoken multiple times [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4767.759999999999s)]
*  that day and I was planning to send him the pictures right after and make a joke about how [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4773.599999999999s)]
*  he was interrupting our photo session. He then texted me to call him right away. And all of a [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4778.0s)]
*  sudden, my heart and my stomach smashed together. Something must have happened. The realization that [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4783.36s)]
*  he wasn't ever going to be the same started to sink in. For the immediate future from now on, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4789.52s)]
*  I would need to take on the role of his protector. I could have left Alec. I could have taken our [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4795.6s)]
*  kids with me and abandoned him. But I didn't. I stood by him because it was the right thing to do. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4801.52s)]
*  I saw and know the truth. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4809.120000000001s)]
*  What? [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4811.12s)]
*  At his lowest moment, she's going, I could have taken the kids and abandoned him. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4816.4s)]
*  Why is that step one that you're jumping to? That doesn't even make sense. And I know that the [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4820.5599999999995s)]
*  publisher is like, part of the deal you have to write about the Helena Hutchins situation. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4825.5199999999995s)]
*  How could they not? But at the same time, can this woman's family have some peace? We understand in [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4829.84s)]
*  no world did Alec Baldwin mean to shoot this woman. This is a New York guy, probably doesn't [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4834.8s)]
*  know his way around guns all that well. So he didn't mean to shoot her. But can her family just [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4839.6s)]
*  have some peace? Do you have to now do this for press to sell the book, Hilaria? Yeah, that's the [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4843.6s)]
*  thing. Who says, yes, he came under all this public scrutiny. It was a media firestorm. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4850.0s)]
*  I could have left him. I could have taken the children and walked. What? As if that's one of [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4856.64s)]
*  the top options. When your spouse is in trouble, you're like, I could just peace out. Fuck him. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4862.400000000001s)]
*  Really, this is probably not mine. Really, who even thinks like that? You know, like, this is like [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4867.28s)]
*  Doug writing a book about our life together. And then he gets the chapter about NBC when I was all [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4872.320000000001s)]
*  over the papers and saying terrible things about me. And like him being like, I could have left [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4879.4400000000005s)]
*  her right then. I could have taken our kids and walked. Who? What? Wait a minute, honey. Well, [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4884.16s)]
*  huh? This tells me that she probably met with lawyers and crisis management people at the time [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4889.6s)]
*  and was probably being advised from a PR standpoint, you could leave, do your own thing. You go solo, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4897.040000000001s)]
*  get a People magazine cover. You've left him behind. That's all drama. It makes me think there [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4902.400000000001s)]
*  was probably there are probably a council of advisors in her ear giving her that as an option. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4906.64s)]
*  The fact that she's even thinking about it, because I've been in the same relationship now for three [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4910.72s)]
*  years. I couldn't imagine if he's at his lowest or I'm at my lowest saying, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4914.8s)]
*  peace out. I'm taking the I'm leaving. We don't have kids, but I'm leaving and moving the hell [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4919.28s)]
*  out of here. That would never happen. That's just so bizarre. If you're actually in a genuine, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4923.92s)]
*  if you're in a genuine relationship, not a fame relationship, that's not even a thought. It's [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4927.92s)]
*  very weird. Correct. And it goes back to my original theory, because if she's in, she's like a [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4931.92s)]
*  fame digger, it's crossed over to infamy for Alec Baldwin. So I might be out like the one thing [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4936.4800000000005s)]
*  I was in it for has waned and actually gone a different direction, which doesn't work for me. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4944.16s)]
*  So I, you know, under the implicit terms of our relationship, which is like, I'm young and vibrant, [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4949.5199999999995s)]
*  and probably a nice partner in certain ways. And you are supposed to be the one who is famous and [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4954.96s)]
*  gets us a lot of positive attention. And you've broken your end of the bargain, which is why I [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4961.68s)]
*  can leave our contracts been violated. This is a breach by you, which releases me from all [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4966.16s)]
*  further obligations. That's really what I hear her saying there. Here she is on their reality show. [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4973.44s)]
*  Can I say one thing real quick? Yeah. Yeah. About Ellaria, I think she would have trouble [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4978.16s)]
*  finding another man, number one, with all the baggage from Alec. But I don't know a lot of [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4982.72s)]
*  single guys who want to date a woman with eight children. You know what I'm saying? Like this [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4987.12s)]
*  woman who's been through the press and she's dragging eight babies around that are like six [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4991.599999999999s)]
*  months apart. I don't think she's going to have an easy time. She might as well just stay with Alec, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4995.28s)]
*  honestly. She doesn't need a new husband if she really is just in it for the money, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=4999.52s)]
*  because listen to what she said on their reality show, SOT26. After my first marriage, [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5003.68s)]
*  I said, let's have a pre-nup. She wasn't happy about it. No, no. First of all, I still don't [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5009.280000000001s)]
*  understand quite what a pre-nup is. It is awkward, but I don't actually quite understand what a [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5013.6s)]
*  pre-nup is because you're like, after a certain number of kids, it's this. And I was like, you [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5017.92s)]
*  know what? I'll just sign it, which was probably very stupid of me back then. Now I read it again. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5021.280000000001s)]
*  But like, I just said I was saying I don't really want to think about the end by the beginning. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5026.32s)]
*  And then you're like, yeah, let's talk slower. You're speaking English in a Spanish cadence, [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5029.759999999999s)]
*  which is always perilous for me. Slow down just to kiss. I can't understand. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5034.719999999999s)]
*  These two don't like each other. And it seemed to be at the end, he released her from signing. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5040.88s)]
*  That's what I think I heard there. But in any event, I think she'll be okay at this point. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5045.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. If my boyfriend's downstairs, I'm not signing a pre-nup either. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5050.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, for Ilaria. You know, absolutely. This accent is bizarre. They hate each other. Ilaria reminds [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5054.8s)]
*  me of my friends when we go out for Mexican food at like Il Quintanero or something in New York. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5060.96s)]
*  They'll have a few margaritas and suddenly they have like margarita induced Spanish accent. They're [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5065.84s)]
*  like, Margarita, cilantro, enchilada. You know, it's like girls out for a bachelorette party, [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5070.56s)]
*  having some margs. That's Ilaria. I think she kind of has a Spanish accent that comes in when [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5075.84s)]
*  she's drinking or I don't know if she's in this mood. But I also think one thing we don't talk [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5080.8s)]
*  about enough, 10% of the population is nuts. 10% of the population has some major psychological [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5084.8s)]
*  issues. So she has fake accents, fake names, fake personalities. She's a baby making machine. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5091.2s)]
*  She could just be nuts. I just want to close the segment and go to break with this. [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5097.68s)]
*  It wasn't just cucumber. How you say cucumber in English? Here's just yet another of her. You tell [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5103.76s)]
*  me whether this sounds like a girl from the suburbs of Boston. I want you guys to realize [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5109.44s)]
*  that we have seven kids and you will have seven kids to escort them to school and to be there [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5115.2s)]
*  when they come home is not good to school. So on a human level, you guys know I'm not going to say [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5122.96s)]
*  anything to you. You know that you know, so please leave my family, please. And let this all play out. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5128.639999999999s)]
*  Okay, so let my kids come home and you stay away from them because they asked me, mommy, [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5137.12s)]
*  what like mommy, what are these people doing? And it's a very hard thing as a mom to try to explain. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5144.879999999999s)]
*  So please go home because I'm not going to say anything and Alec is not going to say anything. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5150.5599999999995s)]
*  Go home. I'm not going to say anything and Alex not going to say anything. And don't bother my [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5157.2s)]
*  family. My baby, they ask me, mommy, what the who does she think she's getting? [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5162.56s)]
*  That's not neurodivergence. And you know what? No, screw you, Ilaria, for trying to piggyback [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5169.120000000001s)]
*  on people who actually do have neurodivergence and ADHD and blaming your weird fake cosplaying [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5174.400000000001s)]
*  as a Spaniard on them. No, absolutely. I have tons of friends who are dyslexic, who have ADHD. [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5180.8s)]
*  None of them have fake accents. So I'm just racking my brain to think maybe she's a little [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5187.360000000001s)]
*  off base here. She also said she's taking her kids to school with that many kids in New York. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5191.6s)]
*  Just open your own school. You've got 10,000 children. And she reminds me of this French [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5195.68s)]
*  guy I dated back in 2021. We'd be at dinner and he'd be like, can I get the how do you say diet [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5200.160000000001s)]

*  do you say taxi cab? And I'm like, you just said taxi cab, you idiot. So that's Ilaria. She's like, [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5209.280000000001s)]
*  how do you say cucumber? I'm like, you know the word, sweetheart. Anyway, I guess. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5213.92s)]
*  You fool. No one. This is why it didn't work out between the two of you. It sounds like you have [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5218.56s)]

*  it to you. Hold that tight, please. Okay. Okay. Now this of course didn't come out of the ether. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5409.6s)]
*  I want to play for you the latest bit from her podcast, which is called confessions of a female [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5417.84s)]
*  founder. Here she is. When I think about big milestones for my own business with as ever, [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5427.04s)]
*  I mean, Netflix coming on is my business partner, huge, just having a global powerhouse that believed [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5433.2s)]
*  in me and the site selling out in the first 45 minutes of launch, everything, every single piece [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5440.8s)]
*  that we had been working on that told me that customers, people believed in me in this vision. [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5447.52s)]
*  That's all you really want as a founder. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5454.240000000001s)]
*  You two are a founder now, founder of the spot podcast with link Lauren. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5461.6s)]
*  Welcome to the club. Thank you. She sounded like me at the top of the show. Thank you, Megan. Thank [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5465.76s)]
*  you so much. But yeah, no, with Meghan Markle, the only thing she found was a rich, famous husband. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5470.72s)]
*  If that's what constitutes being a founder, then sure, Meghan Markle's a founder. She found a [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5476.32s)]
*  mansion in Montecito to live in. She found a sit down interview with Oprah to bash and shank her [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5481.5199999999995s)]
*  in-laws and accuse them of racism. But founding, putting your name on some cheap jellies, jams, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5486.719999999999s)]
*  and dog biscuits, I don't know. Sounds like a fall from grace for me. If I were Meghan Markle, [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5492.16s)]
*  here's what I would do. Not that I'm taking gold digging advice from Ilaria. I would have stayed [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5496.799999999999s)]
*  over in the UK eating crumpets and scones. I would have pumped out a few more royal babies. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5500.96s)]
*  And then the queen would have passed on to greener pastures. Philip would have passed on. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5505.36s)]
*  And then they could have stepped back from the royal family. But now you're living in California, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5509.12s)]
*  like a wannabe Kardashian, hawking jellies, jams, and dog biscuits. Good for you, girl. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5512.88s)]
*  And I love how she's like, we sold out in 45 minutes. Meanwhile, not said is what was the [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5520.24s)]
*  inventory like? Honestly, for all I know, she had 20 jars of jam and 20 of her weird popcorn things. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5525.92s)]
*  I have no idea. It's not necessarily a sign of success that you sold out in 45 minutes. I have [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5533.92s)]
*  no idea what your inventory was. Maureen actually bought one of the jams just for research. And it [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5538.08s)]
*  was in the most shoddy, pathetic little cardboard. It was truly something you'd find at your kids [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5542.96s)]
*  bake sale, whatever. They put something together, just try to hawk goods and raise money for a [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5550.8s)]
*  worthy cause. It was like this cardboard cheap as ever stencil thing. It wasn't good. So anyway, [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5554.8s)]
*  there she is being self promotional. And then Dan Woodman, when he was on the other day, [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5560.96s)]
*  he came out and he told us this, that one of her guests, another founder, because she just keeps [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5564.72s)]
*  having on people who she's invested in. And that's so they can tell everybody how great she is. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5570.08s)]
*  She decides to take a shot at her for wearing Birkenstocks when she first met the Duchess, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5574.4800000000005s)]
*  Link, which you don't do. Watch this. And I just remember you kept shifting your feet in and out [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5581.92s)]
*  of your Birkenstocks. And I thought, Oh my gosh, is this my first investment? By the way, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5587.92s)]
*  I wear Birks at home. I think it's a really smart choice. There was no shame in your game. I was [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5593.76s)]
*  just struck by the fact that you were so comfortable. Oh my God. I believe one of them. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5598.88s)]
*  Yeah, she's definitely insulting her. Megan Markle is not in any position to give fashion advice. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5608.88s)]
*  Every time she leaves the house, she looks like crap. Everything is misshapen. She doesn't have a [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5615.5199999999995s)]
*  steamer. She doesn't have an iron. She's basically miss wrinkled pants. And then when she was in New [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5620.48s)]
*  York recently for that Time Magazine event, she had these pants that were like a burlap potato sack. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5624.96s)]
*  They were so flowy. If you jumped out of a plane, you would land safely on the ground. Megan Markle [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5629.759999999999s)]
*  looks terrible half the time. Nothing fits her. She's got these scrawny little legs and she wears [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5634.4s)]
*  billowing linen pants. Nothing fits her. So she's in the last position to give fashion advice [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5638.96s)]
*  whatsoever. Catherine, Princess Catherine looks impeccable because guess what? She actually has [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5644.16s)]
*  a steamer and a tailor. I guess Megan got a hundred million from Netflix. Couldn't afford a steamer. [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5648.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah. And just a stylist. That's all it would really take. Okay. We've got to move on because [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5653.28s)]
*  we've got to get to what's happening with Bill Belichick. There is a reporter who is claiming [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5658.32s)]
*  his name is Pablo Torre. He used to be at ESPN who is claiming that the girlfriend, Jordan Hudson, [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5664.72s)]
*  is no longer allowed in the UNC football building in the wake of all this controversy over whether [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5671.84s)]
*  she's like elder abusing him. Listen to his report. Two sources at the University of North [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5677.679999999999s)]
*  Carolina tell me that there has been a decision was made last week by the higher ups inside the [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5682.32s)]
*  athletic department that had hired Bill Belichick to be the highest paid public employee, not just [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5687.12s)]
*  coach in the state of North Carolina at $10 million a year. And that decision was that Jordan Hudson [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5692.639999999999s)]
*  is no longer allowed in the football building. She is not allowed on the football field. Quote, [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5698.64s)]
*  don't think you'll be hearing much from Jordan moving forward. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5705.92s)]
*  Okay. But then UNC came out following his report and issued the following statement. While Jordan [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5710.88s)]
*  Hudson is not an employee here, she's welcome to the Carolina football facilities. The school said [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5715.68s)]
*  in a statement, Jordan will continue to manage all activities related to coach Belichick's personal [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5719.84s)]
*  brand outside of his responsibilities for Carolina football and the university. So they say she's [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5723.76s)]
*  welcome. Then Pablo fires back saying, standby, the University of North Carolina can choose to [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5728.4s)]
*  describe or change its position on Jordan Hudson's involvement. However, it wishes following the [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5738.08s)]
*  publication of our episodes. It was on his podcast. He said it, we requested comment and filed dozens [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5743.44s)]
*  of FOIA requests that were not satisfied. And we stand by the specific reporting in our episode, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5747.92s)]
*  which came from the highest levels of the football program. So the drama continues Link Lauren, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5753.2s)]
*  what do you make of it? And why say you are you on team Jordan? Well, first off, I don't think she [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5760.5599999999995s)]
*  needs to come with him everywhere. This isn't bring your child to work day. You know what I'm saying? [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5767.12s)]
*  So I understand she doesn't need to be at practice. She doesn't need to be in the stadium or anything [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5771.2s)]
*  like that. She can stay at home, but also can't a girl just become rich and famous anymore? Do we [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5775.2s)]
*  have to drag Jordan or Jordan, however the hell she spells it through the mud all the time? Do [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5780.4s)]
*  people think she's dating Bill Belichick because he's this like hot sexy guy who's great in bed? [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5785.2s)]
*  No, that's not what he's with. I mean, his prowess was too much for her to fend off. No, we all know [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5790.4s)]
*  why she's with him. And the one thing I'll say is men do not seed land or surrender unless they want [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5795.44s)]
*  to. Right? There are tons of older guys who let women come in and manage their house. You know, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5800.879999999999s)]
*  some of these older guys, they barely have anything in their fridge, their wardrobes out dated. They [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5805.44s)]
*  don't have a huge social life. So he's allowed her to come in. One piece of advice for Jordan [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5809.44s)]
*  Hudson I would give, she also should hire a stylist like Meghan Markle because she looks like a [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5813.44s)]
*  disaster every time she leaves the house. And Jordan, I'm saying this as someone who's on your [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5817.839999999999s)]
*  team, sweetheart, the outfits, the oversized t-shirt with the thigh high heels. Like if you're going to [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5821.36s)]
*  have that role, you need to dress for the role you want. Dress for the job you want, Jordan Hudson. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5826.08s)]
*  Okay. Well, I see your point. It may be the, you know, the bargain they struck and why are we [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5830.639999999999s)]
*  immediately on his side? You know, she, it does look to me slightly like elder abuse. So I do [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5835.04s)]
*  have those questions, but if he's of sound mind, it's his choice. I still find her obnoxious though. [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5838.8s)]
*  Okay. Well, Michelle Obama, I'll say one thing real quick. I was, I understand people say there [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5843.360000000001s)]
*  might be some undue influence here. We talked about that also. There might be some undue influence [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5848.08s)]
*  if he is having cognitive issues. So if that's the case, I will eat crow down the line. I promise. [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5852.320000000001s)]
*  But I don't know if he is. I mean, just looks like that from afar. I don't know. Bill Belichick. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5856.8s)]
*  Okay. Michelle Obama, listen to this. And at this phase of my life, I'm, I'm in therapy right now [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5860.16s)]
*  because I'm transitioning, you know, I'm 60 years old. I finished a really hard thing in my life [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5866.88s)]
*  with my family intact. I'm an empty nester. My girls are in, you know, they, they've been launched. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5874.32s)]
*  And now for the first time, as I've said before, every choice that I'm making is completely mine. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5881.36s)]
*  I now don't have the excuse of, well, my kids need this or my husband needs that or the country [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5888.08s)]
*  needs that. So how do I think about this next phase? [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5893.36s)]
*  Once again, speaking a reference to her for time as first lady negatively, and I'm transitioning. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5900.4s)]
*  I mean, an interesting choice of words, given how the internet refers to her. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5905.5199999999995s)]
*  Well, the last time a famous person sat down in an interview and said, I'm transitioning, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5910.4s)]
*  it was Bruce Jenner. So I did get nervous for a second guy. See Michelle Obama. She says, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5914.639999999999s)]
*  I'm transitioning. Also all the moms out there drop a comment. When I went off to college, [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5918.8s)]
*  my mom said, I'm going to be so sad. I'm going to walk around the house crying. She did not do [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5923.12s)]
*  any of that. I think she was happy to have her life back. So Michelle Obama, maybe you do need [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5927.28s)]
*  therapy. I'm also sick of Michelle Obama, who's probably worth hundreds of millions of dollars. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5931.5199999999995s)]
*  She has a mansion in Martha's Vineyard. I'm tired of her complaining that her life is so terrible. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5935.92s)]
*  If she's sad, if she's depressed, everybody else has real issues. They're going to work. They might [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5940.8s)]
*  be sad and depressed, taking care of a sick relative. They don't need the former first lady [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5945.44s)]
*  who got to fly around on our dime for eight years complaining that her life is so terrible. [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5949.36s)]
*  I'm sick of it. Tell it to your friend, Oprah. Link, Lauren, very excited for Monday. Everybody's [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5954.32s)]
*  got to check out his first episode of Spot On with Link, Lauren. A pleasure, my friend. Have [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5960.799999999999s)]
*  a great weekend. Thank you so much, Megan. Thank you. And all of you enjoy your weekend too. See [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b8_b_YqrXAE&t=5965.2s)]
