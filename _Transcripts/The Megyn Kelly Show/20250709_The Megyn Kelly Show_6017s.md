Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Mark Halperin, host of Next Up with Mark Halperin, to discuss the breaking news that Biden's former White House doctor Kevin O’Connor refused to testify about Biden’s cognitive decline and plead the Fifth instead, his role in participating in the Biden mental acuity cover-up, the two distinct alarming scenarios about why Biden’s cognitive decline was hidden from the public during his presidency, a prominent Parkinson's specialist neurologist visited the White House, the revelation last year that Biden was evaluated by a Parkinson’s disease specialist eight times, new information about a Kamala Harris campaign interview that went so poorly it never aired, a shocking story about Biden's advisors vs. the media, how the Epstein case is dividing MAGA, Trump’s obvious attempt to shift attention away from the story, what Tucker Carlson and Charlie Kirk are saying now, why we might never learn what really happened with Jeffrey Epstein, whether more documents will ever actually get released, marvel at David Muir as the "vainest" man at ABC, his tight t-shirt covering the Texas flooding, the way other TV hosts dressed during the coverage, and more.

# Biden's Doc Refuses to Talk, Epstein is Dividing MAGA, and David Muir's Wardrobe, with Mark Halperin
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [July 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show, [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1.8800000000000001s)]
*  an unbelievable event just happening on Capitol Hill. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  We'll get to what's happening on Epstein. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=8.44s)]
*  We got to talk about Dr. O'Connor. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=9.84s)]
*  This is incredible. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=11.86s)]
*  President Biden's doctor, Kevin O'Connor, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=14.56s)]
*  just got called to Capitol Hill [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=19.16s)]
*  where he was supposed to talk to James Comer [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=21.92s)]
*  and his committee about the care he provided [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=26.32s)]
*  for the now former president. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=30.12s)]
*  And not only at this closed door hearing [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=32.46s)]
*  did he refuse to answer questions [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=35.28s)]
*  based on the doctor patient privilege, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=38.480000000000004s)]
*  but he asserted his Fifth Amendment right [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=41.96s)]
*  not to incriminate himself as a secondary ground [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=44.5s)]
*  for not answering. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=48.84s)]
*  His Fifth Amendment ground to not incriminate himself. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=50.56s)]
*  Joining me now, Mark Halperin. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=54.56s)]

*  Since President Trump was sworn in, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=76.88s)]
*  his administration has made enormous progress [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=78.46000000000001s)]
*  at a breakneck pace. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=80.86s)]
*  But don't forget, while they're moving mountains [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=82.7s)]
*  for the good of the nation, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=84.26s)]
*  you've got your own personal savings to worry about. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=86.34s)]
*  And one of the best ways to look after your savings [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=87.78s)]
*  is through diversification, particularly with gold. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=89.82s)]
*  Like from Birch Gold Group. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=93.3s)]
*  In the past 12 months, the value of gold has increased [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=95.14s)]
*  by 40% OMG. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=97.74s)]
*  Central banks continue to bolster demand for gold [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=102.32s)]
*  by buying in record quantities. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=104.78s)]
*  Global instability and tension is high [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=107.14s)]
*  and Birch Gold makes owning physical gold extremely easy. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=109.22s)]
*  Easily convert an existing IRA or 401k [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=113.38000000000001s)]
*  into a tax sheltered IRA in physical gold [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=116.94s)]
*  or buy some to store in your home safe. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=119.5s)]
*  Just text MK to the number 989898 [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=122.10000000000001s)]
*  and Birch Gold will send you a free info kit on gold. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=124.46000000000001s)]
*  There's no obligation, just useful information. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=127.5s)]
*  With an A plus rating from the Better Business Bureau [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=130.86s)]
*  and tens of thousands of happy customers, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=133.06s)]
*  take control of your savings today. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=134.98000000000002s)]
*  Text MK to the number 989898. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=136.82s)]
*  Mark, welcome back. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=140.92000000000002s)]
*  This is the guy at the center of it all. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=142.54s)]
*  This is the guy who was treating him [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=144.38s)]
*  throughout the presidency. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=145.73999999999998s)]
*  The guy who was on the receiving end, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=147.17999999999998s)]
*  we believe of those double digit visits [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=149.42s)]
*  from neurologists during Biden's last year, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=152.78s)]
*  which no one bothered to report on [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=155.5s)]
*  in the White House press corps until it was the very end. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=157.66s)]
*  The guy who would have known about the prostate cancer, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=161.39999999999998s)]
*  if anyone knew. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=166.04s)]
*  And now he gets summoned by James Comer [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  to speak to the committee that's looking into [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=170.62s)]
*  the auto pen, et cetera. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=174.1s)]
*  And yeah, I mean, I guess I would have expected [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=176.22s)]
*  Dr. Patient privilege as an assertion, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=177.94s)]
*  though we'll get to Comer's objections [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=180.18s)]
*  as to why that's inappropriate too. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=182.38s)]
*  But whoa, the Fifth Amendment against incriminating himself, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=184.66s)]
*  what's happening here? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=188.42000000000002s)]
*  Well, not adequately explained by his counsel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=190.5s)]
*  I would put this in the shocking [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=193.12s)]
*  but not surprising category. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=194.5s)]
*  They were able to get through the presidency [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=197.18s)]
*  without this guy ever being held accountable. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=201.14s)]
*  He's not a normal doctor for a normal patient. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=202.66s)]
*  He's the president's doctor and he's the president, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=205.29999999999998s)]
*  he's a doctor to a president who along with his family [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=208.14s)]
*  and close aides endangered America [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  by having someone serve who had many moments, [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=214.1s)]
*  we don't know exactly how many, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=217.5s)]
*  where he wasn't up to doing the job. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=218.9s)]
*  So Comer has done a much better job [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=220.28s)]
*  framing this the correct way, not as politics, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=222.82s)]
*  although obviously there are politics here, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=225.06s)]
*  but we have to get to the bottom of this. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=227.14s)]
*  This isn't a matter of embarrassing the Bidens. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=228.82s)]
*  It isn't a matter of violating [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=231.38s)]
*  the president's right to privacy. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=232.62s)]
*  It's a matter of how can we make sure [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  that this doesn't happen again? [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=236.7s)]
*  And I'll say he is not a normal doctor [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=238.29999999999998s)]
*  with a normal patient. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=240.34s)]
*  So I think in the end, [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  the Republicans are gonna win this fight, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=242.78s)]
*  but his invocation of the Fifth Amendment, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=244.66s)]
*  his hiding behind doctor patient confidentiality [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=247.22s)]
*  goes to prove what we all suspected, [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=250.14s)]
*  which is they don't want whatever is left of the coverup [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=252.57999999999998s)]
*  to fall apart. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=255.74s)]
*  They're going to try to keep America [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=256.78s)]
*  from learning the truth. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=258.41999999999996s)]
*  I don't think it'll work. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=259.97999999999996s)]
*  And I'd urge Democrats to join in getting [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=261.17999999999995s)]
*  to the bottom of it rather than being [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=262.97999999999996s)]
*  on the wrong side of history. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=264.5s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=266.53999999999996s)]
*  Now, as a result of him doing this [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=267.61999999999995s)]
*  and Comer's jumping up and down about it, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=270.46s)]
*  we just get this in from Dr. O'Connor's lawyers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=273.29999999999995s)]
*  They cite the pending DOJ criminal investigation, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=276.85999999999996s)]
*  which they say leaves Dr. O'Connor no choice [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=281.26s)]
*  but to invoke his constitutional rights [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=283.65999999999997s)]
*  under the Fifth Amendment of the Constitution [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=285.36s)]
*  to any questions posted by the committee. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=287.24s)]
*  We want to emphasize that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=288.72s)]
*  asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=289.88s)]
*  does not imply that Dr. O'Connor has committed any crime. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=291.12s)]
*  The pending DOJ investigation took me by surprise. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=296.16s)]
*  Last I heard Trump said the DOJ should investigate this. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=301.24s)]
*  And I don't know that there is a DOJ investigation [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=305.90000000000003s)]
*  and that could matter. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=309.54s)]
*  But I will say this, either way, [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=312.2s)]
*  if he did nothing wrong, what's the problem? [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=316.04s)]
*  Why is Dr. O'Connor genuinely worried about going to prison [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=318.88s)]
*  if he was just providing medical advice [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=321.6s)]
*  and not actually participating in a coverup? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=324.32s)]
*  Yeah, well, in America, we should not challenge people's [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=326.76s)]
*  right to invoke the Fifth Amendment as a matter of law [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=332.0s)]
*  and individual liberty. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=334.68s)]
*  But this is about political and public accountability. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=336.36s)]
*  I don't know what crime he might've committed, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=340.64s)]
*  but I do know that everything we know suggests [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=343.0s)]
*  that he was a central figure in attempting to keep [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=346.2s)]
*  the president's actual condition from the American people. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=350.68s)]
*  You know, you could take a lot of examples. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=353.96s)]
*  Either he tested him for cancer [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  and covered up the results, a big problem, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=358.96s)]
*  or he didn't test him, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=362.02s)]
*  which doctors will tell you also a big problem. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=363.12s)]
*  Either he got him some scans [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=366.2s)]
*  to see what was going on in his brain [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=369.17999999999995s)]
*  and didn't release the results [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=371.02s)]
*  or say that they occurred, or he didn't do it. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=372.84s)]
*  Either way, a big problem. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=375.44s)]
*  And this is not a normal patient. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=377.32s)]
*  So I don't know if he's truly afraid of legal liability. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=378.88s)]
*  What he's clearly counting on, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=383.08s)]
*  what the whole Biden operation is counting on [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=384.12s)]
*  is what they counted on for four years, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=386.28s)]
*  which is that the press won't cover it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=388.4s)]
*  And I'll say, I don't always go reflexively to imagine [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=390.35999999999996s)]
*  if the shoe were on the other foot, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=393.79999999999995s)]
*  but imagine if a Republican president [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=395.4s)]
*  was facing these accusations and a doctor took the fifth [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=397.2s)]
*  and had cited patient, a doctor confidentiality. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=400.48s)]
*  Will this story lead the news tonight [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=403.96s)]
*  on the broadcast networks? [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=406.32s)]
*  Would it be on the front page of the New York Times, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=407.76s)]
*  the Washington Post? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=409.36s)]
*  It should, but I doubt that it will. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=410.4s)]
*  This guy is a doctor, but he's also an American citizen. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=413.2s)]
*  And he played a massive role in what was a cover-up. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=417.24s)]
*  I mean, we know for sure that his haircut is a crime [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=421.48s)]
*  for which he should be cross-examined. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=424.56s)]
*  Against all humanity, not just those living now, Megan, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=426.08s)]
*  but our ancestors, our ancestors, wherever they are, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=428.78s)]
*  are feeling the pain every time he appears on camera. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=432.61999999999995s)]
*  And so, yes. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=435.7s)]
*  It goes deep. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=436.53999999999996s)]
*  He needs to be held accountable for that. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=437.38s)]
*  And the barber too, I don't think he can let whoever [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=440.65999999999997s)]
*  cut the hair off the hook. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=442.73999999999995s)]
*  That person as well has some explaining to do. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=444.38s)]
*  It's a conspiracy. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=447.53999999999996s)]
*  Many were involved and there are many predicate acts there. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=448.65999999999997s)]
*  But he- And again, the guy in the next barber chair, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=452.34s)]
*  also some culpability. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=455.38s)]
*  How did they let it happen? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=456.7s)]
*  He had a culpability to turn and say, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=457.54s)]
*  no, don't leave the chair. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=458.70000000000005s)]
*  The guy's obviously not done. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=460.46000000000004s)]
*  All right, we will drop in a close-up picture [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=464.3s)]
*  of Kevin O'Connor's hair for the viewing audience [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=466.38s)]
*  on YouTube at this point. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=469.22s)]
*  There's only video of him leaving Comer's office today [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=471.18s)]
*  because the behind closed doors thing was not, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=473.94s)]
*  here he comes, standby. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=477.54s)]
*  There he is, there he is with the glasses. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=478.62s)]
*  It's a problem. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=481.5s)]
*  So Comer also put out his own statement after this. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=483.38s)]
*  And this is what he says. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=488.21999999999997s)]
*  Number one, he says, you can't assert the patient, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=489.62s)]
*  the doctor patient privilege, he says, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=493.9s)]
*  because the DC Court of Appeals has made clear [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=495.74s)]
*  that that privilege only limits a physician's ability [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=499.58s)]
*  to disclose confidential patient information [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  in federal courts in DC and in the District [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=506.42s)]
*  of Columbia courts, meaning like the state courts in DC. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=510.21999999999997s)]
*  And Congress is not a court, therefore, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=512.66s)]
*  you may not assert that privilege. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=515.14s)]
*  That's compelling. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=516.86s)]
*  Then he says, second, according to the AMA, [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=518.54s)]
*  the American Medical Association's Code [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=522.5s)]
*  of Medical Ethics, he says it's inapplicable [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=523.98s)]
*  because it's overridden by our subpoena. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=527.5799999999999s)]
*  And he cites medical ethics opinion 9.7.1, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=530.18s)]
*  physicians who testify as fact witnesses [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=534.5799999999999s)]
*  in legal claims involving a patient they have treated [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=536.9399999999999s)]
*  must hold the patient's medical interests paramount [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=539.5799999999999s)]
*  by protecting the confidentiality [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=541.9399999999999s)]
*  of the patient's health information [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=543.5799999999999s)]
*  unless the physician is legally compelled [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=545.58s)]
*  to disclose the information. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=549.1s)]
*  And so that's Comer's point, is that you are now [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=551.4200000000001s)]
*  legally compelled to disclose the information. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=556.1800000000001s)]
*  And that's why now they're, and I think they know [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=559.74s)]
*  they're gonna lose on that, Mark, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=562.38s)]
*  which is why they've added fifth, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=563.5400000000001s)]
*  and citing what I think is a made up DOJ investigation. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=565.1s)]
*  We're looking into this right now, we'll know soon, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=568.74s)]
*  but I think it was just a Trump threat. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=571.1800000000001s)]
*  As far as I know, the DOJ is not actively investigating [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=573.7s)]
*  Kevin O'Connor. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=576.1400000000001s)]
*  It's possible that they got some inquiry from the FBI. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=577.5s)]
*  I don't know factually, but you're right, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=580.5400000000001s)]
*  we should know that. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=582.22s)]
*  They also in their statement hid behind President Trump's [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=583.58s)]
*  invocation of the fifth in the case in New York [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=586.6600000000001s)]
*  with Letitia James. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=589.94s)]
*  I'll say again, this was a four year cover up. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=591.58s)]
*  They, it was not about a small matter. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=595.5s)]
*  It was about the ability of the United States [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=598.0600000000001s)]
*  to function properly. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=600.3000000000001s)]
*  And I think they can continue to try to use every legal [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=602.54s)]
*  and political and media trick possible [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=606.06s)]
*  to keep from explaining what happened, [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=609.06s)]
*  or they can get on the right side of history [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=611.26s)]
*  and explain it. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=613.6999999999999s)]
*  But we've got more people coming in, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=614.98s)]
*  a lot of the political aides are scheduled as well. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=617.4599999999999s)]
*  They obviously don't have doctor patient, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=619.9399999999999s)]
*  maybe they'll invoke the fifth as well. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=621.5799999999999s)]
*  Maybe they'll try to give clever, cute answers, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=623.62s)]
*  but this doctor is central to the thing. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=626.02s)]
*  And I think that he can't be stopped from invoking the fifth. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=627.98s)]
*  But he can be put in sharp relief in a public hearing [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=633.38s)]
*  and ask questions that I think the American people [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=637.14s)]
*  would find reasonable, which is how did he care for [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=638.98s)]
*  not just his patient, but for the public interest [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=642.46s)]
*  as the person who basically by putting out [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=645.1800000000001s)]
*  an annual statement certified that Joe Biden [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=647.14s)]
*  had no cognitive decline. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=649.58s)]
*  And we know that's not true. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=652.02s)]
*  So now Comer gets him behind closed doors. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=656.5400000000001s)]
*  Again, the haircut. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=660.34s)]
*  For the listening audience, it's the short bangs, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=661.98s)]
*  like the serial killer bangs that come just mid forehead. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=664.74s)]
*  They're not even totally even, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=669.74s)]
*  but they're disturbingly short with like a bowl cut [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=671.22s)]
*  after that. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  I don't know what's going on there, [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=675.78s)]
*  but it does speak to the man's terrible judgment. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=676.9s)]
*  Do you know those restaurants where you eat in the dark, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=679.46s)]
*  where you're supposed to like have the sense of the food [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=681.46s)]
*  without seeing it? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=683.38s)]
*  I feel like maybe he goes to one of those barbers [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=684.38s)]
*  where the lights are all off. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=686.18s)]
*  And so the barbers just got to feel their way through [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=687.62s)]
*  how to cut the hair. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=690.74s)]
*  It's also one of those situations like where you go [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=692.22s)]
*  to one of those restaurants and you go to the bathroom [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=693.98s)]
*  and it's absolutely disgusting and not clean at all. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=695.82s)]
*  Then you're like, I got to get out of here. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=699.46s)]
*  When you walk in, you see your physician with that hair. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  You got to turn around. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=703.14s)]
*  You got to walk out. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=704.1s)]
*  There's a level of care that's not present [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=705.1s)]
*  in his own daily routine. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=707.62s)]
*  And you shouldn't subject yourself to this man. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=709.02s)]
*  Here's what Comer asked him. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=711.66s)]
*  These are the two questions he asked. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=713.42s)]
*  He said, I'm going to read the first two questions [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=715.22s)]
*  that were asked. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=716.9s)]
*  This is Comer speaking to the press right after. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=717.74s)]
*  Were you ever told to lie about the president's health? [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=720.38s)]
*  He pleaded the fifth amendment. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=725.26s)]
*  He would not answer that question. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=726.7s)]
*  The second question, did you ever believe President Biden [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=728.3000000000001s)]
*  was unfit to execute his duty? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=731.82s)]
*  And he again pleaded the fifth. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=735.34s)]
*  Comer says this is unprecedented. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=738.38s)]
*  And I think this adds more fuel to the fire [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=740.1s)]
*  that there was a cover up here. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=742.94s)]
*  This was, we learned from the Tapper Thompson book [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=745.62s)]
*  that Dr. O'Connor was allegedly behind the scenes [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=753.9000000000001s)]
*  trying to get Joe Biden more rest. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=757.38s)]
*  He quipped that Biden's staff were trying to kill him [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=761.0600000000001s)]
*  while Dr. O'Connor was trying to keep him alive. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=764.14s)]
*  Given Biden's age, Dr. O'Connor also privately said [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=767.34s)]
*  that if he had another bad fall, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=770.5s)]
*  a wheelchair might be necessary [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=772.0200000000001s)]
*  for what could be a difficult recovery, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=773.98s)]
*  but the aides didn't want that while he was running. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=775.62s)]
*  And he told others that he did not believe [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=778.4200000000001s)]
*  the science required him to do a cognitive test on Biden [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=781.0600000000001s)]
*  in connection with his annual physical. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=785.4200000000001s)]
*  He saw the president frequently, [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=787.1800000000001s)]
*  and if he had reason for concern, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=789.58s)]
*  he would have performed one. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=791.5400000000001s)]
*  Ultimately, Joe Biden's political advisors agreed. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=793.0600000000001s)]
*  Oh, I'm sure it was a real arm twist. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=795.62s)]
*  But this was Jill Biden's guy. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=797.22s)]
*  Remember, isn't he super, like Jill picked him. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=798.7800000000001s)]
*  There was the Secret Service agent, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=802.22s)]
*  but this guy too, I think is close with Jill Biden [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=803.74s)]
*  and has a loyalty to the Bidens [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=806.6600000000001s)]
*  as opposed to the country from the sound of it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=809.3000000000001s)]
*  Well, all presidents chooses their white ass position, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=812.9000000000001s)]
*  someone they're comfortable with. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=815.26s)]
*  But I know you're not guilty of this, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=816.34s)]
*  but I think too much of the press is acting as if [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=819.82s)]
*  there's some mystery here about what the guy did. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=823.58s)]
*  Now, some of the details are a mystery [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=825.82s)]
*  and who exactly was in charge is a mystery, [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=827.82s)]
*  but there's no mystery here. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=830.98s)]
*  He didn't ever answer questions from the press. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=832.82s)]
*  And he either, as I said before, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=836.0200000000001s)]
*  he either performed tests and lied about [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=838.2600000000001s)]
*  whether they were performed and didn't disclose the results, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=839.82s)]
*  or he didn't perform them, [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=842.34s)]
*  whereas it doesn't make any sense [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=843.86s)]
*  not to have had brain scans. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=846.1s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense not to have had cancer tests. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=847.2600000000001s)]
*  So I don't know, as I said before, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=849.5s)]
*  I don't know what crime he might be guilty of, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=852.7800000000001s)]
*  but I do know that he's abusing the public trust. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=855.1800000000001s)]
*  And after four years of participating in the coverup, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=858.2600000000001s)]
*  and arguably the central figure, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=862.1s)]
*  because he is a doctor and he does have a responsibility [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=863.9000000000001s)]
*  both to his patient and the public interest, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=866.3000000000001s)]
*  I just think it's hard to me to see [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=869.0200000000001s)]
*  how he's gonna sustain this, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=872.34s)]
*  unless the coverup was even more insidious [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=874.0600000000001s)]
*  than we knew it to be. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=877.34s)]
*  In other words, one thing that hasn't been acknowledged [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=878.1600000000001s)]
*  by anybody on the inside, [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=881.1400000000001s)]
*  and he'd be considered on the inside, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=882.62s)]
*  is that they knew how bad it was and they covered it up. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=884.46s)]
*  Their premise is we didn't really know. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=887.3800000000001s)]
*  If it went that far, again, [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=890.42s)]
*  I don't know that that's a crime, [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=893.06s)]
*  but it's a political crime and it's a policy crime [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=895.06s)]
*  and it's an irresponsible action for a doctor [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=897.5799999999999s)]
*  who's supposed to have a obligation [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=900.78s)]
*  to the American people to have done. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=902.3s)]
*  Well, but here's the truth. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=904.4599999999999s)]
*  No one's looking to put Dr. O'Connor in jail. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=907.16s)]
*  Not Comer, not the DOJ. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=910.78s)]
*  By the way, we did find out on June 4th, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=912.74s)]
*  the White House released a memo [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=915.06s)]
*  directing the council to the president [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=916.74s)]
*  and the attorney general to conduct an investigation [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=918.46s)]
*  to determine whether certain individuals conspire [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=921.26s)]
*  to deceive the public about Biden's mental state [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=923.4200000000001s)]
*  and unconstitutionally exercise the authorities [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=925.36s)]
*  and responsibilities of the president. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=927.74s)]
*  And a subpoena was issued in June, possibly. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=929.5400000000001s)]
*  I don't know if that means to Dr. O'Connor. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=933.3000000000001s)]
*  So the president did direct DOJ and council of the president [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=935.0600000000001s)]
*  to conduct an investigation. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=938.0600000000001s)]
*  But my point is simply the odds of the DOJ [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=939.5400000000001s)]
*  and certainly Comer and the US Congress [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=944.26s)]
*  giving Dr. O'Connor immunity to remove his ability [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=947.14s)]
*  to raise the Fifth Amendment are very high. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=951.38s)]
*  That's probably, that's almost certainly [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=953.8199999999999s)]
*  what they're going to do. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=956.0s)]
*  Trump doesn't wanna put Dr. O'Connor behind bars. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=956.84s)]
*  He wants answers. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=959.3s)]
*  And once you remove the Fifth Amendment privilege [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=960.58s)]
*  and it looks like he's gonna lose the doctor-patient privilege [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=963.9399999999999s)]
*  because it has an exception to it, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=966.26s)]
*  meaning if you've gotten a lawful subpoena to testify. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=969.74s)]
*  And of course we've seen that in medical malpractice cases. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=973.46s)]
*  You cannot just maintain doctor-patient confidentiality [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=975.42s)]
*  to the death. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=978.06s)]
*  You get a lawful subpoena to appear in a courtroom [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=978.9s)]
*  about what you did or said, you're gonna have to breach it. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=981.2199999999999s)]
*  This guy's going to be forced to talk at some point, Mark. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=984.4599999999999s)]
*  And then we're gonna learn what he's so concerned about. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=986.66s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's important that the committee, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=990.42s)]
*  and again, I'd urge the Democrats [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=992.9s)]
*  and the committee to join in. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=994.14s)]
*  Keep focused on the public policy question, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=995.86s)]
*  which is vital for the country. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=998.02s)]
*  We can't have another situation [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=999.54s)]
*  where a president suffers cognitive decline [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1001.18s)]
*  right before our eyes. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1003.16s)]
*  And the media and the Democrats pretend it's not happening. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1004.54s)]
*  They just can't let that happen again. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1007.98s)]
*  So I agree that he's not gonna go to prison, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1009.98s)]
*  but look at what they're doing. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1012.74s)]
*  They're playing the normal card. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1014.02s)]
*  Trump did it too. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1015.38s)]
*  Trump is trying to improperly investigate us. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1016.88s)]
*  They're trying to get the Democrat, the media rather, [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1019.98s)]
*  to go back to their reflexive defense of the coverup. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1023.18s)]
*  And it's gonna be interesting to see, as I said, [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1026.86s)]
*  how this is covered, [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1029.24s)]
*  because the press has kind of acknowledged the coverup, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1030.54s)]
*  kind of, not fully. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1034.1s)]
*  So if you acknowledge the coverup, [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1035.94s)]
*  and then the coverup's being sustained [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1037.86s)]
*  under a lawful subpoena by the majority in the House, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1039.82s)]
*  I don't know how the press can treat that [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1042.82s)]
*  like a small story or an insignificant step, [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1044.46s)]
*  but I'm skeptical. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1046.54s)]
*  We'll see in the coming hours how it gets treated. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1047.94s)]
*  I asked my team to pull this. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1051.3s)]
*  I believe it was the New York Post [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1052.98s)]
*  that broke the story of the neurologist [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1055.8s)]
*  visiting the White House, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1058.3s)]
*  almost double digits leading into the summer. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1060.26s)]
*  This came out the summer, this time last year, [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1063.5s)]
*  just a little bit more than 12 months ago [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1066.14s)]
*  when Biden was hanging by a thread after that debate, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1068.34s)]
*  and all the press of course suddenly got really interested [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1072.7s)]
*  in his mental wellbeing. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1075.18s)]
*  The Post had been interested prior to, [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1077.58s)]
*  but they broke the story on July 6th, [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1079.86s)]
*  yes, almost exactly a year, [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1082.74s)]
*  about the fact that Biden's physician, Kevin O'Connor, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1085.58s)]
*  met with a Parkinson's disease specialist [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1090.34s)]
*  in the White House, [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1093.6599999999999s)]
*  and then the New York Times followed thereafter, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1094.5s)]
*  and the report was that an expert on Parkinson's disease [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1097.5s)]
*  from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1101.1799999999998s)]
*  visited the White House eight times in eight months [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1103.34s)]
*  from the summer of 23 through spring of 24, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1107.1399999999999s)]
*  including at least once for a meeting [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1110.6599999999999s)]
*  with President Biden's physician, Dr. Kevin O'Connor. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1112.54s)]
*  The expert who came, Dr. Kevin Kennard, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1115.84s)]
*  is a neurologist who specializes in movement disorders [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1118.6599999999999s)]
*  and recently published a paper on Parkinson's. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1122.5s)]
*  By the way, not for nothing, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1126.5s)]
*  but this came up when I sat with the New York Times, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1127.5s)]
*  and Lulu Garcia Navarro and I were having our tete-a-tete [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1129.58s)]
*  about how you can't trust these podcasters [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1132.38s)]
*  to tell you the truth, and there's no system, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1135.86s)]
*  and I was like, oh, but we can trust the New York Times, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1137.98s)]
*  and I said, they cut this out, but I said, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1140.24s)]
*  where was Peter Baker and the report [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1142.34s)]
*  that a neurologist had visited the White House eight times [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1144.64s)]
*  or 10 times over the course of the prior year? [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1147.88s)]
*  Finally, he got his name on it [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1150.74s)]
*  after the New York Post broke it one year ago today, [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1152.18s)]
*  but nowhere, he had no interest. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1155.82s)]
*  He wasn't checking the logs. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1157.44s)]
*  He didn't care about Biden's mental acuity. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1158.58s)]
*  He had another press failure. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1160.82s)]
*  Your thoughts, Bob? [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1162.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1163.16s)]
*  So I say again, if the president was not being seen [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1164.38s)]
*  by a Parkinson's expert, [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1168.5s)]
*  O'Connor should be stripped of his medical license. [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1170.74s)]
*  Of course he should have been seen by a Parkinson's expert. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1173.02s)]
*  And of course he should have been having regular brain scans [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1175.86s)]
*  to see what was going on. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1179.2s)]
*  So this is where they're kind of checkmated [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1180.76s)]
*  because they either didn't do these things [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1185.76s)]
*  and it's malpractice because the president clearly needed [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1188.88s)]
*  as a father and as a grandfather and as a husband, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1192.68s)]
*  as a human being, he needed the treatment [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1195.7s)]
*  that you or I would get for our dad [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1198.1200000000001s)]
*  if they had those symptoms and behavior. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1200.6200000000001s)]
*  And if they did do them, [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1204.6000000000001s)]
*  which according to this reporting they did, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1205.72s)]
*  what were the results? [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1207.8400000000001s)]
*  Why was he there? [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1209.5600000000002s)]
*  They act as if this is some private citizen Biden [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1210.4s)]
*  who's entitled to his medical privacy [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1213.2800000000002s)]
*  the way private citizens are. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1215.0400000000002s)]
*  If the president of the United States [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1216.64s)]
*  is being seen by a Parkinson's expert, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1218.3000000000002s)]
*  which it appears happened, maybe not, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1220.74s)]
*  but it appears it did and it should have, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1222.7800000000002s)]
*  that should be disclosed [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1225.48s)]
*  and the results should be disclosed. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1226.6200000000001s)]
*  If the president is exhibiting the symptoms [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1228.44s)]
*  that this president did, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1230.96s)]
*  nearly every Parkinson's doctor you've talked to [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1232.2600000000002s)]
*  and I've talked to has said, not my patient, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1235.0s)]
*  but I have a C-SPAN subscription. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1237.76s)]
*  I've seen how he's behaving. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1239.44s)]
*  He needed a full battery of tests [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1240.96s)]
*  and that should be disclosed. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1242.8s)]
*  It fundamentally, it makes a mockery [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1244.52s)]
*  of the annual release of the note [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1247.24s)]
*  from the president's doctor [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1249.6s)]
*  if the thing is filled with lies [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1251.24s)]
*  and incomplete descriptions about how he was being treated [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1252.84s)]
*  and what conditions he has. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1257.18s)]
*  By the way, let's slap a subpoena [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1260.44s)]
*  on this Dr. Kevin Kennard. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1261.92s)]
*  He's up next, interesting last name. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1263.2s)]
*  We'll slap a subpoena on him [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1265.84s)]
*  and let's see if he's as loyal to the president [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1268.24s)]
*  or whether he's willing to come forward [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1269.96s)]
*  and give testimony to James Comer understanding. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1271.92s)]
*  Maybe he'll say, I did nothing wrong. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1274.6399999999999s)]
*  I don't have to assert any privilege whatsoever. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1275.8799999999999s)]
*  Let me tell you everything that happened. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1278.68s)]
*  I've been waiting for you to call, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1279.84s)]
*  but I'm sure Comer's in the process of doing that. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1280.96s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1283.28s)]
*  Look, it's not like they're randomly choosing Megan Kelly [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1284.12s)]
*  and saying, I want all the results [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1287.68s)]
*  from your latest GYN exam. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1288.96s)]
*  Like that's a what? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1290.72s)]
*  Okay, if you're a president [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1292.2s)]
*  and then you show obvious cognitive decline [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1294.52s)]
*  that it was on a presidential debate stage. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1297.32s)]
*  Forget all the evidence we have leading into that moment. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1299.72s)]
*  For all the world to see, we are entitled to go back [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1302.2s)]
*  and ask whether you were okay, [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1305.3999999999999s)]
*  what decisions you made and what your mental capacity was [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1308.16s)]
*  at the time that you were making them. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1312.44s)]
*  We're still living with the consequences [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1313.96s)]
*  of a lot of those decisions. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1315.8799999999999s)]
*  So this is a game, you're right, they're not gonna win. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1316.8799999999999s)]
*  Comer's gonna play the long game. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1319.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he's gonna get these objections overruled [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1321.12s)]
*  bit by bit and we will know. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1323.44s)]
*  We will know what happened over Joe Biden. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1325.52s)]
*  And it's not even, we're focusing on the mental acuity, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1326.8000000000002s)]
*  but there's the matter of the prostate cancer. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1329.3200000000002s)]
*  It appears that the sitting president of the United States [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1331.48s)]
*  had advanced cancer while he was running for reelection, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1333.52s)]
*  trying to say he'd have another four years. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1338.1200000000001s)]
*  And for all we know, at that point, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1340.8400000000001s)]
*  maybe it had already metastasized to his bones. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1342.52s)]
*  Who knows what the prognosis was? [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1345.1200000000001s)]
*  Somebody does know, just you and I aren't among them. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1347.0800000000002s)]
*  Yeah, and the excuse that was made [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1350.44s)]
*  when this became an issue a few weeks ago [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1354.48s)]
*  was men his age typically don't get the tests [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1357.04s)]
*  because sometimes they're false positives [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1360.76s)]
*  and it brings up questions of treatment and anxiety. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1363.1200000000001s)]
*  He's not a normal person, he's a president. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1367.16s)]
*  And as you said, running for reelection. [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1370.1200000000001s)]
*  So if they really didn't test him, [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1371.96s)]
*  I would say that's malpractice, truly. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1374.1200000000001s)]
*  And if they did test him and they're lying [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1376.96s)]
*  about the results, also a problem. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1378.6s)]
*  And it doesn't really matter which it is. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1380.76s)]
*  The reality is, experts will tell you, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1383.1599999999999s)]
*  he has an advanced stage, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1385.84s)]
*  it should have been detected earlier. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1387.48s)]
*  And if it wasn't, again, shame on the doctor for saying, [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1389.28s)]
*  well, we're not gonna do the test [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1392.72s)]
*  because it's normal not to at someone his age. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1393.84s)]
*  He's the president, he's running for reelection. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1396.6799999999998s)]
*  The president of the United States has advanced cancer. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1399.44s)]
*  That's a national crisis. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1401.84s)]
*  It's not some private personal matter. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1403.8799999999999s)]
*  And it's not the same as Trump with his flippin'. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1407.44s)]
*  He's the greatest, most in-shape president of all time, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1412.32s)]
*  Dr. Memos, which are kind of a laugh, [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1415.92s)]
*  but he does take a cognitive test. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1418.28s)]
*  And if Trump showed signs, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1420.1200000000001s)]
*  repeated obvious signs of cognitive decline, [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1422.32s)]
*  or it came out that he had advanced cancer, [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1425.64s)]
*  there would be an inquiry by Democrats too [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1429.32s)]
*  on what actually went on in those meetings, [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1431.88s)]
*  what tests were conducted. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1434.24s)]
*  Now we want actual results, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1437.5600000000002s)]
*  and you can bet his doctor too would get a subpoena [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1439.16s)]
*  that they'd have to respond to. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1441.72s)]
*  Yeah, I don't love Donald Trump's history [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1443.3200000000002s)]
*  of medical disclosure, including those [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1445.5600000000002s)]
*  buffoonish over the top letters. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1447.24s)]
*  Although I will say that last disclosure [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1449.24s)]
*  from the White House was much fuller [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1451.6000000000001s)]
*  than what Joe Biden had put out in terms of stats and data. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1454.3600000000001s)]
*  It should be more complete. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1459.64s)]
*  This is a problem. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1460.92s)]
*  I've seen it my whole career. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1462.3600000000001s)]
*  There's a reporter in my career, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1463.8799999999999s)]
*  Dr. Lawrence K. Altman of the New York Times, [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1466.52s)]
*  who's really dug into this with candidates and presidents [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1468.8s)]
*  and tried to hold them accountable. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1472.0s)]
*  And it's a big problem, which I've long said, [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1474.36s)]
*  on days when the president's gonna, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1477.0s)]
*  the doctor's gonna brief [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1478.9199999999998s)]
*  or the press secretary's gonna brief, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1480.0s)]
*  every White House political, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1481.6799999999998s)]
*  because they're all political reporters, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1483.24s)]
*  should be subbed out, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1484.4399999999998s)]
*  and the health reporters should go. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  Because political reporters shouldn't be asking [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1488.9199999999998s)]
*  the White House press secretary [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1492.2s)]
*  or the White House doctor medical questions. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1493.3200000000002s)]
*  They don't have the expertise to do it. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1495.4s)]
*  And so the Biden thing is the extreme case, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1497.28s)]
*  but there hasn't been a single president [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1500.96s)]
*  or presidential candidate in my career [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1502.52s)]
*  who has sufficiently safeguarded the public interest [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1504.64s)]
*  by having much more disclosure than they do. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1507.0800000000002s)]
*  And that's up to the news organizations [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1511.1200000000001s)]
*  to safeguard the public [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1513.1200000000001s)]
*  in the spirit of Dr. Altman of the New York Times, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1514.6000000000001s)]
*  to really understand the questions to be asked [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1517.0s)]
*  and to ask them repeatedly and to demand answers, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1519.64s)]
*  because there's nothing, literally nothing more important [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1523.12s)]
*  to understand whether the person's up to doing the job. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1525.56s)]
*  Yeah, and look, they're gonna get, [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1527.84s)]
*  Jill Biden is gonna get a subpoena. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1529.52s)]
*  Joe Biden could get one, we'll see. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1532.28s)]
*  But those around Joe Biden on the inner circle, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1534.2399999999998s)]
*  Donilon and the others who were running cover for him [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1537.1999999999998s)]
*  are all getting subpoenaed. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1540.9199999999998s)]
*  And again, the only one, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1542.56s)]
*  I think President Trump and the Comer are genuinely issued, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1545.9199999999998s)]
*  are interested in the truth, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1549.32s)]
*  not in putting people behind bars. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1550.76s)]
*  I'm sure Trump wouldn't mind seeing [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1552.48s)]
*  some of these people go behind bars, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1553.84s)]
*  given what was done to him. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1555.04s)]
*  But if they give immunity to all of these people, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1556.44s)]
*  then they can't hide behind that, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1559.3600000000001s)]
*  the Fifth Amendment anymore. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1561.64s)]
*  So this is gonna be an interesting one to follow. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1563.68s)]
*  It's fascinating to see the first one on deck, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1566.16s)]
*  Dr. Kevin O'Connor immediately assert the Fifth [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1569.1200000000001s)]
*  in response to two very anodyne questions [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1572.56s)]
*  that anybody should be able to answer without much concern. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1575.32s)]
*  Again, were you ever told a lie [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1578.1200000000001s)]
*  about the president's health? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1579.6s)]
*  And did you ever believe President Biden [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1580.9199999999998s)]
*  was unfit to execute his duty? [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1583.9199999999998s)]
*  That was all going down about 365 days ago. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1585.9199999999998s)]
*  As long as we're there, Mark Halpern, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1590.1599999999999s)]
*  let me ask you about another piece of news [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1591.84s)]
*  that just came out from that same time period. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1593.4399999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris, I remember we reported on this at the time, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1595.9599999999998s)]
*  but I don't think we had the tape. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1599.8s)]
*  She went on a podcast, [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1601.9199999999998s)]
*  she decided to dip a toe into the podcast world. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1604.12s)]
*  She went on with that vulgar sex podcaster, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1607.1599999999999s)]
*  and they had a real heart to heart [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1610.4399999999998s)]
*  about how much they both love abortion. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1611.6399999999999s)]
*  And she was given an invitation to go on Joe Rogan, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1613.84s)]
*  which she was too afraid to accept. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1616.76s)]
*  And then she swung by Subway Takes, hosted by Kareem Rama. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1619.28s)]
*  And apparently it went so poorly that he did not release it. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1625.4399999999998s)]
*  And he was a Kamala supporter. [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1631.4399999999998s)]
*  He was thrilled that she swung by, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1633.4399999999998s)]
*  and he thought, at worst case scenario, [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1635.6399999999999s)]
*  I can say I interviewed the sitting vice president, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1636.76s)]
*  the possible next president, show a picture to my kids. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1639.6s)]
*  And he, Kareem, just sat down with Forbes editor, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1642.3999999999999s)]
*  with a Forbes editor, [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1646.32s)]
*  and spoke to what happened in this interview [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1647.76s)]
*  that was so disastrous, he never aired it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1651.7199999999998s)]
*  Look at this, SOT7. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1654.56s)]
*  The take was really confusing and weird and not good. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1656.32s)]
*  And so mutually agreed that we shouldn't publish it. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1659.4399999999998s)]
*  I see. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1663.56s)]
*  I got lucky because I didn't want to be blamed [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1664.4s)]
*  for her losing. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1667.72s)]
*  Her take was that bad? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1668.88s)]
*  It was really, really bad. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1670.2s)]
*  And it was like, didn't make any sense. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1671.6000000000001s)]
*  Bacon as a spice, bacon as a spice. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1673.92s)]
*  Bacon as a spice. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1676.72s)]
*  Bacon as a spice. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1677.5600000000002s)]
*  You think that was her opinion, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1678.4s)]
*  or you think she had like a research group [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1679.22s)]
*  trying to figure something that's gonna work? [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1680.16s)]
*  A research group, [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1681.0s)]
*  because originally the take that I was pitched was great. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1681.8400000000001s)]
*  And it was that she does not like [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1686.76s)]
*  to take her shoes off on airplanes. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1688.3600000000001s)]
*  And then at the last minute, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1690.0400000000002s)]
*  I think research group said, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1691.96s)]
*  this makes you look rich and snobby. [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1693.44s)]
*  And you need to appeal to the American people. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1696.8s)]
*  So she went with the bacon. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1700.1200000000001s)]
*  And I tried to pause the interview and say, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1701.68s)]
*  trust me, we shouldn't do the bacon thing. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1704.28s)]
*  And I was overrided by this guy, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1707.28s)]
*  who was maybe her deputy campaign manager. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1711.08s)]
*  An hour later, I got a call that said, [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1712.88s)]
*  we can't do bacon. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1716.64s)]
*  But then I tried to cut it into something else. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1717.56s)]
*  And I did make it work. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1720.92s)]
*  And then they were like, this makes her look. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1721.96s)]
*  And I said, whose fault is that? [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1724.08s)]
*  We can't, trust me, we can't do bacon, Mark. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1729.32s)]
*  Megan, how bad with this interview you have to go [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1733.4s)]
*  for you guys to just kill it out. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1735.4s)]
*  I don't think it's ever happened. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1739.56s)]
*  This isn't going well, let's kill it out. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1740.4s)]
*  My sort of signature line about Kamala Harris is, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1744.2s)]
*  she does not like to make difficult decisions [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1747.0s)]
*  under pressure. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1749.04s)]
*  And you saw that as vice president, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1750.12s)]
*  you saw that as a presidential candidate. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1751.56s)]
*  This was a tough one. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1752.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but it's like difficult decision under pressure. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1753.8799999999999s)]
*  Bacon as a spice, the host tells you don't do it. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1756.36s)]
*  And you still like agonize over it. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1759.36s)]
*  Or in the first one before that, don't underestimate it. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1761.8s)]
*  Because she also had to decide, do I stick with, [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1764.6s)]
*  it's a hassle to take off my shoes [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1767.24s)]
*  getting onto the airplane. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1768.72s)]
*  Like something that now has been universally accepted [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1769.96s)]
*  as Trump reverses that through his TSA. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1772.28s)]
*  She would have been ahead of the curve. [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1773.84s)]
*  Was it shoes through TSA or was it shoes on the plane? [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1775.6399999999999s)]
*  I thought it was shoes on the plane. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1778.24s)]
*  Maybe I misheard. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1779.8s)]
*  Either way. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1781.36s)]
*  On the plane, but it's an issue. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1782.2s)]
*  It's an issue. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1784.32s)]
*  I bet you there are a lot more stories about this. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1785.1599999999999s)]
*  Because as we saw throughout the campaign, [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1787.9199999999998s)]
*  we saw this with the endless Rogan negotiations. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1789.52s)]
*  Like they were afraid to put her in situations. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1792.96s)]
*  This is why when people say, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1795.44s)]
*  oh, she was such a good candidate. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1796.84s)]
*  There's only, if she hadn't been such a great candidate, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1798.44s)]
*  she couldn't have turned things around in 90 days. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1800.52s)]
*  She's not a good candidate. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1803.3999999999999s)]
*  She didn't perform as a good candidate. [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1804.32s)]
*  And they knew that because they had to negotiate. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1805.68s)]
*  Somebody says, yeah, go do Rogan or go do, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1809.12s)]
*  what's his name? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1812.3999999999999s)]
*  The comedian who's been on your show. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1813.22s)]
*  Theovon? [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1816.32s)]
*  No. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1817.36s)]
*  Oh, Andrew Schultz. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1818.2s)]
*  Go do Andrew. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1819.52s)]
*  Trump should be like, yeah, let's go. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1820.36s)]
*  I'll stay for four hours. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1821.6s)]
*  And her team is like, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1822.92s)]
*  what size is the table gonna be? [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1825.28s)]
*  What temperature will the water be? [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1827.28s)]
*  What questions will you ask? [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1829.52s)]
*  Can we edit it? [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1830.76s)]
*  All these hyper controlling things. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1832.04s)]
*  And to have her spend time doing a podcast, [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1834.24s)]
*  and it's so bad, it can't be aired. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1837.08s)]
*  Maybe that's happened in American history. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1839.84s)]
*  It might've happened to Monroe, but I doubt it. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1841.52s)]
*  She, wait, oh, she, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1846.8s)]
*  I guess Schultz asked her, but she declined. [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1849.12s)]
*  Of course, yeah. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1851.6s)]
*  What a shock. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1852.4399999999998s)]
*  Of course, of course. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1853.28s)]
*  Yeah, so, but think about it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1854.12s)]
*  Like of all the inanities out there, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1855.6399999999999s)]
*  like you can't make your case about bacon [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1857.48s)]
*  in a compelling way. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1860.9199999999998s)]
*  Like even I could make the case [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1862.1999999999998s)]
*  that you could use bacon as a spice. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1863.8799999999999s)]
*  I wouldn't argue this, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1866.0800000000002s)]
*  but if I had to in a court of law, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1867.1200000000001s)]
*  or like model UN style, [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1868.64s)]
*  where you're not given a choice, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1869.8400000000001s)]
*  this is what you're arguing. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1871.4s)]
*  I would say they dry it up, they chop it up, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1872.68s)]
*  they put in one of those spice looking shakers. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1874.72s)]
*  People shake it on their salad. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1877.1200000000001s)]
*  It's even a commercial. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1879.04s)]
*  I've seen it in commercials being shaken on a salad. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1880.4s)]
*  You could make the case if you had to. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1882.76s)]
*  When I was a child, there was a thing called Bacos. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1884.92s)]
*  That probably didn't actually have bacon in it. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1887.8400000000001s)]
*  I can only imagine what Bobby Kennedy would say [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1891.8400000000001s)]
*  about the ingredients of Bacos. [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1893.92s)]
*  But yeah, of course you could argue that. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1896.2s)]
*  But the point is you're going on some podcasts, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1898.04s)]
*  your staff should have researched it, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1901.24s)]
*  and you should be swaggering in and killing it [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1903.0s)]
*  rather than having the segment actually killed [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1905.4s)]
*  because you can't perform well enough. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1909.52s)]
*  It's why I say, as Bill Clinton once said about Mitt Romney, [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1911.0s)]
*  that person should not have a job [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1917.72s)]
*  that requires them to speak in public. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1919.24s)]
*  And I think the same thing applies to her. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1921.44s)]
*  If it's a pressure situation. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1924.68s)]
*  And I confess I don't know the format of this show [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1926.96s)]
*  that she went on, but it sounds like [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1930.24s)]
*  they shouldn't have gone into it without being confident [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1932.48s)]
*  that she could master it, and it sounds like she couldn't. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1934.56s)]
*  And by the way, she picked the subject. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1937.44s)]
*  That's what's so crazy about it. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1939.76s)]
*  That's his whole point. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1940.6s)]
*  They had to settle on the shoes thing, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1941.84s)]
*  then she thought it would make her look too elitist [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1943.56s)]
*  because she was trying to tell us all [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1945.68s)]
*  she had jobs at McDonald's, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1946.64s)]
*  which was under scrutiny, of course. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1948.0s)]
*  And now she doesn't want to look like the child of privilege [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1949.64s)]
*  that she was. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1952.88s)]
*  And so she switches to bacon as a spice. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1954.1200000000001s)]
*  She chooses bacon as a spice. [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1956.1200000000001s)]
*  She can't make her own argument. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1957.8000000000002s)]
*  She's so inept at it that they have to cut it [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1960.0400000000002s)]
*  out of subway takes, a fun, lighthearted show [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1962.44s)]
*  where you're supposed to just go on [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1965.64s)]
*  and show that you can be a fun person. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1966.68s)]
*  I sort of loved that host's attitude [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1969.1200000000001s)]
*  as he explained the tragedy, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1971.7600000000002s)]
*  that he didn't want to be blamed for her losing. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1973.2s)]
*  And her performance was so bad, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1974.96s)]
*  he thought it would lead in a linear way [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1976.48s)]
*  to 270 electoral votes from Donald Trump [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1978.1200000000001s)]
*  if he had pressed send and uploaded it. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1981.48s)]
*  So I sort of enjoyed that. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1983.48s)]
*  And now I kind of want to go on that show. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1984.76s)]
*  Yeah, the tragedy, it was, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1987.24s)]
*  he did seem to really feel this deeply. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1990.6399999999999s)]
*  Deeply, deeply. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1993.3999999999999s)]
*  It's not good, trust me, it's not good. [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1994.6799999999998s)]
*  It was hard. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1999.0s)]
*  Now he has to release the tape. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=1999.84s)]
*  Now my only goal in life is to actually see the actual tape. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2002.32s)]
*  Ask your sound engineer to invoke the brotherhood [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2006.4399999999998s)]
*  and sisterhood of sound engineers [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2009.6s)]
*  and see if we can create the world exclusive on that. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2011.56s)]
*  Yes, I mean, it would be like some of those ditty tapes. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2014.8s)]
*  We don't have to say where they came from. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2018.36s)]
*  We don't have to be explicit. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2020.08s)]
*  It could be someone went rogue. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2021.36s)]
*  And let's crank up the AI or finger puppets [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2023.1599999999999s)]
*  because I don't want just the audio. [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2025.3999999999999s)]
*  I want to see something. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2026.6399999999999s)]
*  Maybe it'll be my next parody, Mark. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2029.52s)]
*  You can play the podcaster and I'll play Kamala Harris. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2031.24s)]
*  We could do it in the next segment. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2034.9599999999998s)]
*  We could do, I'll be the podcaster [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2036.1999999999998s)]
*  and you explained to me bacon as a spice [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2038.32s)]
*  in a way so inept that the host who was sympathetic to her [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2040.12s)]
*  said it would eliminate her chances [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2043.8s)]
*  of getting to 270 electoral votes [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2045.68s)]
*  had it ever been uploaded to Spotify. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2047.6s)]
*  It's really unbelievable. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2050.88s)]
*  Okay, wait. It is. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2052.0s)]
*  I'm loving this walk down memory lane. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2052.88s)]
*  There's more news from this same timeframe. [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2055.16s)]
*  Can you believe it was only 12 months ago? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2058.44s)]
*  No. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2060.32s)]
*  Where there's yet another book out [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2061.32s)]
*  on Joe Biden and his mental decline. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2063.84s)]
*  And this book is by Josh Dawsey of the Washington Post [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2067.16s)]
*  and two others who were formerly at the Washington Post. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2069.7599999999998s)]
*  And this book talks about how I think it was Dawsey, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2072.08s)]
*  one of the three, got the phone number of Joe Biden, [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2075.44s)]
*  managed to get the cell number of Joe Biden. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2079.7999999999997s)]
*  Meanwhile, Trump gives his cell phone number [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2082.4s)]
*  out to like everybody. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2084.4s)]
*  It was funny. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2085.8399999999997s)]
*  It was about, I don't know, a year and a half ago, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2086.68s)]
*  Dan Bongino was on the show and he's talking about how [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2087.88s)]
*  he talks to the president on the cell phone all the time. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2090.0s)]
*  He's like, yeah, you probably have it. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2092.44s)]
*  You know, I was like, no, no. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2093.44s)]
*  It's crawled on the wall of every cracker barrel [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2096.0s)]
*  south of the Mason Dixon line. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2098.04s)]
*  Well, now Trump and I are in touch via cell. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2100.48s)]
*  But at the time we weren't, I was last to the party. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2102.68s)]
*  Anyway, he's very easy to give it out. [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2105.92s)]
*  He wants to talk to the press. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2108.72s)]
*  He wants to talk to everybody. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2110.04s)]
*  Joe Biden, completely the opposite. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2111.16s)]
*  Kamala Harris, completely the opposite. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2113.36s)]
*  But really, there was reason for Joe Biden's aides [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2114.84s)]
*  to not let him be too easily accessible. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2117.64s)]
*  And so he gets the number somehow. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2121.04s)]
*  He doesn't reveal how. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2124.4s)]
*  And he writes about how this past March, March of 2025, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2125.44s)]
*  after Joe Biden's left office, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2129.7200000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump has been sworn in, [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2131.2400000000002s)]
*  he calls him up and says, I'd like to talk to you. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2132.64s)]
*  And Joe Biden says, all right, well, I'm busy now, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2135.88s)]
*  but call me back and we'll talk. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2137.92s)]
*  So he did, he called him back. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2140.04s)]
*  And they had a very quick conversation as Joe Biden [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2142.1600000000003s)]
*  was leaving for the train or something like that [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2144.92s)]
*  about how things were going. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2146.84s)]
*  My team, can you guys help me out? [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2149.28s)]
*  What page is this on in the packet? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2150.6s)]
*  Because I want to get the actual back and forth [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2151.88s)]
*  on how it went. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2153.36s)]
*  Oh, here it is, page five. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2154.88s)]
*  I think it's Tyler Pager, not Josh Dossie. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2156.28s)]
*  He was one of the co-authors, Tyler Pager. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2158.96s)]
*  Yeah, you're right, it's Tyler Pager. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2160.96s)]
*  Okay, so let's see. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2162.6s)]
*  Yes, Tyler Pager writes as follows. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2166.48s)]
*  So he said he'd be willing to speak for the book [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2169.2000000000003s)]
*  the next day. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2170.92s)]
*  The next morning he answered and said he was running late [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2172.08s)]
*  to catch a train. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2174.04s)]
*  He said he had a very negative view of Trump's second term. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2174.88s)]
*  I don't see anything he's done that's been productive, [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2177.92s)]
*  he said. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2180.08s)]
*  Asked if he had any regrets about dropping out [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2180.92s)]
*  of the presidential race. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2182.92s)]
*  He said, no, not now. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2183.76s)]
*  I don't spend a lot of time on regrets. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2185.96s)]
*  He quickly hung up to get on the train. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2187.8s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2189.92s)]
*  After the first call, the book continues, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2190.96s)]
*  furious Biden aides repeatedly called [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2193.88s)]
*  and texted Tyler Pager. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2196.84s)]
*  After the brief second call, [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2198.8s)]
*  his aides blocked the reporter's calls [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2200.28s)]
*  to the former president. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2203.0400000000004s)]
*  Two days later, a message from Verizon Wireless [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2204.5600000000004s)]
*  replaced Biden's voicemail message with, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2207.5600000000004s)]
*  the number you dialed has been changed, disconnected, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2210.48s)]
*  or is no longer in service. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2213.28s)]
*  They were that upset that one Washington Post reporter, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2215.84s)]
*  it's not like Megyn Kelly got the number, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2221.1200000000003s)]
*  had managed to break through the fortress [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2224.1600000000003s)]
*  and speak with the now former president [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2227.6000000000004s)]
*  that they actually changed, it sounds like, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2230.8s)]
*  the president's cell phone number. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2233.32s)]
*  Well, and of course contrast to the fact that, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2237.0s)]
*  as you said, you're the last reporter in the world [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2238.7200000000003s)]
*  who had Donald Trump's cell number [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2241.2400000000002s)]
*  and he picks up all the time or calls people all the time. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2242.56s)]
*  The posture that the communications staff [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2245.2400000000002s)]
*  around Joe Biden had and has now apparently, [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2249.28s)]
*  was to protect him and to keep him from talking. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2252.6800000000003s)]
*  And they hid behind this fiction that it was about, [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2255.76s)]
*  you know, he always had what was called, [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2258.7200000000003s)]
*  impolitely, diarrhea of the mouth. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2261.92s)]
*  He was never a safe bet to be free [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2264.04s)]
*  in talking to reporters without supervision. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2267.0800000000004s)]
*  But that was before his cognitive decline. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2269.6000000000004s)]
*  And again, it's testament to the palace guard determination [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2271.96s)]
*  that allowed them to their professional credit in some ways [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2277.16s)]
*  to get the guy through four years, [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2281.3199999999997s)]
*  even though the cognitive decline began [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2282.7599999999998s)]
*  before he even took the oath of office in 2021, [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2284.4s)]
*  they made it through because they browbeat reporters. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2288.04s)]
*  And, you know, I laugh when people [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2291.3199999999997s)]
*  who work for politicians call me and say, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2294.48s)]
*  how dare you ask my boss a question? [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2296.68s)]
*  I laugh and say, that's my job. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2298.44s)]
*  And it's their job to decide whether they wanna answer or not. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2300.64s)]
*  If you think your job is to try to stop me, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2302.68s)]
*  good luck to you. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2304.64s)]
*  But that was the posture of the Biden folks. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2305.68s)]
*  And I think they're right to highlight in the book [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2307.44s)]
*  that the extreme measures they took [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2309.96s)]
*  to keep the reporter from trying to ask Joe Biden questions. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2312.24s)]
*  Okay, so meanwhile, staying in the same timeframe, [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2316.92s)]
*  Selena Zito's out with her new book, Butler. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2321.16s)]
*  And it's a great book, highly recommend. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2324.12s)]
*  And it's already doing very well. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2326.36s)]
*  And it takes a look at what happened at Butler. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2328.16s)]
*  It takes a look at the shooter, Thomas Crooks, [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2329.84s)]
*  and why we don't know more about him. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2332.0s)]
*  And it takes a look at Selena's bird's eye view [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2333.6000000000004s)]
*  from the whole thing. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2336.2000000000003s)]
*  She was steps away from the president when he got shot. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2337.04s)]
*  And what was in the news yesterday [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2339.36s)]
*  was a report that these Democrats are now so determined [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2342.88s)]
*  to stop Trump and to get themselves in the news [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2347.04s)]
*  as like fighters and also cool, [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2350.8s)]
*  that they're actually saying someone needs to get shot. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2355.0s)]
*  Someone needs to go to one of these like ICE facilities, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2358.16s)]
*  these detention facilities, and get so in the face of ICE [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2360.88s)]
*  or the guards who are on duty, [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2364.3199999999997s)]
*  that they, meaning a Democratic lawmaker, [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2366.4s)]
*  this is Democrats saying this, actually get shot. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2368.52s)]
*  Which I would suggest to you is inspired by [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2371.7999999999997s)]
*  in a weird, sick, warped way, what we saw in Butler. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2374.68s)]
*  Because the Democrats went into total denial [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2378.7599999999998s)]
*  that it had even happened when we saw Trump get shot [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2382.64s)]
*  and then rise up with the fight, fight, fight [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2387.0s)]
*  in an extraordinary moment. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2389.52s)]
*  They remember all the truthers on the Trump shooting, [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2391.68s)]
*  Joy Reid, Olbermann. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2395.28s)]
*  There were people you didn't even expect, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2398.16s)]
*  people who are more mainstream who are like, [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2399.92s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2402.12s)]
*  You know, like I actually wanna see the injury [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2403.16s)]
*  who are pretending that the whole thing was made up. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2404.8s)]
*  And now they've morphed all this time later [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2407.44s)]
*  after it's been confirmed by the FBI. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2409.6s)]
*  It was the Joe Biden FBI that confirmed Trump [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2411.68s)]
*  had been shot in the ear and so on. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2415.2s)]
*  Now they have to accept that it happened [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2417.8s)]
*  and now he's won and they see that obviously [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2419.12s)]
*  the way he handled it and all of it propelled him [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2421.84s)]
*  to even more popular status. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2423.92s)]
*  Now they're like, someone needs to take a bullet. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2426.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what's real, that's what's strong. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2429.8s)]
*  And so Mark, just further proof [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2432.44s)]
*  that they've lost their minds. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2434.92s)]
*  Yeah, so I think there's two things [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2437.48s)]
*  about Trump derangement syndrome [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2439.76s)]
*  that are a little bit seeming in contradiction. [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2441.28s)]
*  One is I think we shouldn't use it promiscuously. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2443.96s)]
*  We shouldn't attribute any opposition to Donald Trump. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2447.8s)]
*  We shouldn't attribute it to Trump derangement syndrome [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2451.2400000000002s)]
*  because sometimes there's principled opposition [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2453.52s)]
*  that's not deranged. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2455.76s)]
*  But the other thing is I don't think [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2457.6800000000003s)]
*  we've sufficiently understood the extent to which [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2459.48s)]
*  that is in the minds of so many Democrats, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2462.96s)]
*  both prominent Democrats and rank and file Democrats. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2465.48s)]
*  Truly a phenomena that causes them to say and do things [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2468.56s)]
*  that not only are over the top [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2472.56s)]
*  and this is another example of that. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2477.08s)]
*  You'd have to have severe Trump derangement syndrome [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2479.4399999999996s)]
*  to say, well, look how much being shot helped Trump [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2482.3999999999996s)]
*  so we need to try that ourselves. [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2485.4399999999996s)]
*  And yet again, that is unfortunately for the Democrats [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2487.12s)]
*  and I think for America, the point of view of far too many. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2491.64s)]
*  I don't know, there was a blind quote, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2494.8399999999997s)]
*  who knows how pervasive that sentiment is. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2496.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, they are getting aggressive [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2499.16s)]
*  at ICE detention facilities. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2500.52s)]
*  They are, yeah. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2502.52s)]
*  That was in lawmakers, but it was opponents [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2503.68s)]
*  of the president's policy. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2506.3599999999997s)]
*  Oh, I see what you're saying. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2508.24s)]
*  I thought you meant the thing in Texas the other day. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2509.08s)]
*  Yeah, no, they have been aggressive. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2510.64s)]
*  I think that, and Selena and I talked about this on Next Up, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2512.0s)]
*  besides denying he was shot, besides trying to memory hole it [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2519.3199999999997s)]
*  and not cover it very much, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2523.44s)]
*  besides showing a total lack of curiosity [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2525.72s)]
*  about the motive of the shooter. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2528.44s)]
*  They also, again, act as if Donald Trump [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2531.16s)]
*  either did this on purpose or was exploiting it in some way [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2536.44s)]
*  that was improper. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2539.3599999999997s)]
*  Just a former president of the United States was shot [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2540.2s)]
*  and they can't bring themselves to do anything [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2544.04s)]
*  but be confounded by it as opposed to concerned about it [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2546.92s)]
*  or sympathetic about it. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2550.48s)]
*  And again, it's another manifestation [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2551.56s)]
*  of Trump derangement syndrome that's not good for anybody [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2553.7599999999998s)]
*  except maybe Donald Trump. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2556.64s)]
*  What was so hard about the Trump assassination attempt [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2558.7599999999998s)]
*  for them wasn't even that he got shot, [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2562.16s)]
*  it was how he handled it. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2565.2s)]
*  It was a superhero moment. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2567.72s)]
*  It just was. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2570.08s)]
*  Like, it's the way every, I don't know about every woman, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2571.12s)]
*  but every man on earth, it's the way they hope [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2574.3599999999997s)]
*  they would react if, God forbid, this happened to them [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2578.2s)]
*  with strength and defiance and dignity and as a leader [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2582.2s)]
*  and keeping the crowd calm, all of it. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2587.68s)]
*  It was superhero, it was superhuman. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2589.7999999999997s)]
*  Real-life Rambo. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2592.7999999999997s)]
*  And that's why they can't stand it. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2594.68s)]
*  That's why they went into, it's not real, he faked it, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2597.8799999999997s)]
*  he's not injured, the ear thing is fake, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2602.48s)]
*  and they're still reeling [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2605.12s)]
*  because he actually won the presidency. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2606.72s)]
*  I don't know, I heard you talking about this on your show [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2608.9199999999996s)]
*  and it was just how profound that moment was [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2611.16s)]
*  and how the remnants of it, the consequences of it [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2613.96s)]
*  are still very much lingering with the Trump loyalists [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2617.96s)]
*  and with his greatest detractors. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2620.84s)]
*  Both camps, for sure. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2623.56s)]
*  Okay, so that's Butler, but out of Butler, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2626.48s)]
*  he attracted a brand new and very important friend [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2633.2799999999997s)]
*  and that was Elon Musk. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2636.92s)]
*  Now, Elon Musk is now a frenemy or maybe true enemy, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2639.44s)]
*  I don't know which one, but not really friend [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2643.64s)]
*  of President Trump's anymore. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2646.4s)]
*  The breakup feels real after some sniffing around [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2648.04s)]
*  about maybe we're gonna make up. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2652.1200000000003s)]
*  Seems like they're not making up. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2653.36s)]
*  He was out there just the other day, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2655.1200000000003s)]
*  of course he tweeted that Trump was on the Epstein list [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2656.76s)]
*  and then said he regretted tweeting that, [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2658.7200000000003s)]
*  and then he tweeted that Bannon is on the Epstein list [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2660.2400000000002s)]
*  and then said Bannon's gonna be in jail. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2664.4s)]
*  And now Bannon is out there today. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2666.28s)]
*  Linda Iaccarino announced this morning [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2667.6400000000003s)]
*  she's resigning from ex to the CEO for the past two years [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2669.8s)]
*  and Bannon's saying she's gonna go to jail too. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2672.8s)]
*  So it's like a war between these guys. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2674.72s)]
*  What would she go to jail for? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2678.68s)]
*  She's not going to jail, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2680.7999999999997s)]
*  but Bannon is not only angry at Musk, [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2681.64s)]
*  but Musk has formed this third party, the America party. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2684.68s)]
*  And the conventional wisdom is that this is only going [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2689.16s)]
*  to hurt Republicans. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2691.52s)]
*  And I think he means it to hurt Republicans. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2692.3999999999996s)]
*  He's very angry that Republicans have voted [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2694.2s)]
*  for the one big, beautiful bill [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2695.7999999999997s)]
*  after running for office saying [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2697.56s)]
*  that they'd be fiscal conservatives [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2699.4399999999996s)]
*  and that they didn't wanna increase the deficit [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2700.9599999999996s)]
*  or the debt. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2703.48s)]
*  And Harry Enton over at CNN, their data guru guy, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2705.4s)]
*  took a look at Musk and this third party [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2708.32s)]
*  and here's what he had to say about it, Satri. [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2712.12s)]
*  This entire thing makes very little sense to me. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2714.36s)]
*  It makes about as much sense [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2716.92s)]
*  as selling sand in the desert. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2718.12s)]
*  What is the size of Elon Musk's base? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2719.92s)]
*  Well, I calculate it to be about 4%, just 4%, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2722.4s)]
*  one, two, three, 4% of all voters. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2725.68s)]
*  What is that base made up of? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2728.52s)]
*  Well, it's those who view Elon Musk favorably [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2729.92s)]
*  and the GOP unfavorably. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2732.24s)]
*  We're talking just about 4% of all voters out there [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2734.08s)]
*  because it turns out most of the people who like Elon Musk [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2737.08s)]
*  already like the GOP already. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2739.7999999999997s)]
*  That is, they already have a party for him. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2741.48s)]
*  Americans with an unfavorable view of Ross Perot [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2743.44s)]
*  was only 14% back in 1992. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2745.68s)]
*  Now, the vast majority of Americans [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2748.68s)]
*  are already against Elon Musk. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2750.92s)]
*  58% elected to Congress from a third party since 1970. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2752.92s)]
*  Just 0.2% of all winners, [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2758.48s)]
*  were either third party, independent or right. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2763.16s)]
*  We're only talking about 24 out of over 13,000 winners. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2765.9199999999996s)]
*  The bottom line is third party, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2772.0s)]
*  independents, they just don't succeed. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2773.8399999999997s)]
*  Is he wrong? [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2778.68s)]
*  First of all, do you know Harry? [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2780.2799999999997s)]
*  No, but I'd love to. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2782.2799999999997s)]
*  Well, he's a friend of mine. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2784.12s)]
*  We have dinner occasionally. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2784.96s)]
*  We have mutual friends. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2785.7999999999997s)]
*  We have dinner. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2786.64s)]
*  And I gotta say, that's how Harry talks at dinner too. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2787.48s)]
*  It's extremely exhausting. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2789.9199999999996s)]
*  Level of intensity. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2792.8s)]
*  It was up here and now it's down here. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2793.64s)]
*  They'll say, I want the veal. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2796.08s)]
*  I want the beef. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2797.2400000000002s)]
*  How's the beef? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2798.08s)]
*  Is the beef good? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2798.92s)]
*  I need the beef. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2799.76s)]
*  The beef is 18%. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2800.76s)]
*  He's very intense. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2801.84s)]
*  The appetizer was out of this world. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2802.68s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2805.08s)]
*  You need four things to have even the premise [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2806.28s)]
*  of a possible third party in a country, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2810.7200000000003s)]
*  unlike all the other industrialized democracies [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2813.32s)]
*  that is built legally, institutionally, culturally, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2815.48s)]
*  to keep the duopoly of the two major parties. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2819.36s)]
*  You need a lot of money, right? [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2822.0800000000004s)]
*  Because it's expensive to launch something. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2823.88s)]
*  Check, a lot of money. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2825.84s)]
*  Although, a lot of money, [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2827.0800000000004s)]
*  like would he spend a billion dollars? [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2829.36s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2831.48s)]
*  A lot of money, number one. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2832.32s)]
*  Number two, you need a person who's popular [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2833.1600000000003s)]
*  and who people listen to and look to to say, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2837.8s)]
*  yeah, that person's gonna be different [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2840.2000000000003s)]
*  than Tweedledee and Tweedledum. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2842.4s)]
*  It's not Musk, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2844.2000000000003s)]
*  because as Harry correctly points out, he's not popular. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2845.0400000000004s)]
*  So he's gonna have to find a horse, [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2847.32s)]
*  and whether that's several horses to run Senate [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2849.6400000000003s)]
*  and House races or a presidential candidate, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2851.76s)]
*  he's gotta find actual human beings [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2853.4s)]
*  like Perot who are compelling. [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2855.0800000000004s)]
*  Three, you need an issue agenda [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2856.76s)]
*  that the other parties would have trouble matching. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2859.0800000000004s)]
*  And I don't know what that is, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2861.7200000000003s)]
*  because he talks about fiscal discipline. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2863.5800000000004s)]
*  Is he gonna be the party [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2865.32s)]
*  of cutting social security benefits? [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2866.1600000000003s)]
*  I don't know how he's gonna have an issues agenda [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2868.4s)]
*  like Perot did, although his had some problems too, [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2870.84s)]
*  but he at least had something to talk about. [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2873.6000000000004s)]
*  And then lastly, you need an army [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2875.04s)]
*  of really talented political operatives [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2877.2s)]
*  who are willing to take your money [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2879.48s)]
*  to execute on ballot access [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2881.14s)]
*  and issue development and communications. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2883.56s)]
*  I think you said check on number one. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2886.2799999999997s)]
*  I don't think he has the other three. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2888.2s)]
*  So if he wants to make a few willing consultants super rich [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2890.16s)]
*  by wasting the money, he can, [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2893.58s)]
*  but I don't see it as a practical matter [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2895.96s)]
*  how he goes from his current temper tantrum [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2898.8s)]
*  and anger at the Republicans [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2901.12s)]
*  to doing anything like starting a third party, [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2903.34s)]
*  even getting a single house member elected. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2906.06s)]
*  It's very difficult to do in this country. [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2908.5s)]
*  Well, Andrew Yang is out there saying, [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2911.38s)]
*  I did it and this is how you do it. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2914.1800000000003s)]
*  And he's saying he did manage to get candidates elected [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2916.92s)]
*  that it's really not that hard. [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2919.84s)]
*  Andrew really didn't. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2921.58s)]
*  I mean, maybe I missed it [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2922.46s)]
*  and he got some dog catcher elected somewhere, [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2923.78s)]
*  but Andrew is a very smart guy. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2926.34s)]
*  He's well-meaning. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2928.94s)]
*  I think he understands the challenges of this, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2929.76s)]
*  but they've been at it for a long time now, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2932.22s)]
*  I think a couple of years, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2935.8999999999996s)]
*  and they've not broken through because again, [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2938.1s)]
*  this country is as much as people have been alienated [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2941.06s)]
*  by the two parties, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2944.8199999999997s)]
*  it's inhospitable legally, politically, culturally [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2945.8999999999996s)]
*  to try to start a third party. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2949.52s)]
*  It's just tough. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2950.7s)]
*  It's why Trump ran as a Republican, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2952.3999999999996s)]
*  even though he definitely was not a Republican [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2954.74s)]
*  and probably really isn't still a Republican, [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2957.66s)]
*  much to the consternation of much of the party. [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2960.1s)]
*  He created a third party [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2962.58s)]
*  and he slapped the Republican sticker on it. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2963.54s)]
*  Yeah, he changed the Republican party into his image [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2966.06s)]
*  because he wasn't really a Republican. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2969.54s)]
*  He certainly wasn't a traditional Republican [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2971.2599999999998s)]
*  on so many issues, but that's what you have to do. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2973.2599999999998s)]
*  And by the way, that's another thing, [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2976.14s)]
*  many of us did not believe that Trump was pro-life at all, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2978.66s)]
*  but you can't get the nomination as a Republican [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2983.38s)]
*  without saying that you are. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2985.9s)]
*  And then he governed as a pro-lifer, [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2987.2599999999998s)]
*  so no one really cares. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2988.9s)]
*  Republicans are like, fine, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2990.3s)]
*  what's in his heart is his business, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2991.6200000000003s)]
*  but he's been a very pro-life president. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2993.54s)]
*  The most successful pro-life president [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2995.38s)]
*  in the country's history. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2996.98s)]
*  Exactly, so it's kind of irrelevant. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=2998.82s)]

*  I have been telling you about Firecracker Farm Hot Salt. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3013.78s)]
*  It's been a showstopper gift and must have item [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3016.94s)]
*  for anyone that enjoys spicing up their food. [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3019.38s)]
*  What is hot salt, you may be asking. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3021.7000000000003s)]
*  Well, it is a sea salt infused with a blend of hot pepper [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3024.06s)]
*  that's made by a wonderful little family company. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3027.78s)]
*  It comes in sleek stainless steel push grinders [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3030.06s)]
*  that feel great in hand and are really satisfying to use. [[00:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3032.46s)]
*  Their motto, everything is better with hot salt. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3036.34s)]
*  And based on the reviews, customers are in full agreement. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3039.1s)]
*  So give it a try now. [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3042.34s)]

*  You'll thank me. [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3053.74s)]
*  This time yesterday, literally 24 hours ago, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3055.46s)]
*  we were watching the following [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3058.14s)]
*  out of the White House cabinet meeting [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3060.9s)]
*  where the subject of Jeffrey Epstein came up [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3063.38s)]
*  and Donald Trump injected himself into the exchange, [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3066.66s)]
*  which was meant to be between the New York Post reporter [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3070.46s)]
*  and Pam Bondi as follows, Sat one. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3072.7s)]
*  Your memo and release yesterday, Jeffrey Epstein, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3075.7s)]
*  it left some lingering mysteries. [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3078.5s)]
*  One of the biggest ones is whether he ever worked [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3080.54s)]
*  for a American or foreign intelligence agency. [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3083.62s)]
*  So could you resolve whether or not you did? [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3087.14s)]
*  And also, could you say why there was a minute missing [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3089.2599999999998s)]
*  from the jailhouse tape? [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3091.22s)]
*  Are you still talking about Jeffrey Epstein? [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3092.8599999999997s)]
*  This guy's been talked about for years. [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3095.62s)]
*  You're asking, we have Texas, we have this, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3098.02s)]
*  we have all of the things. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3100.98s)]
*  And are people still talking about this guy, this creep? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3103.3s)]
*  That is unbelievable. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3106.54s)]
*  Do you wanna waste the time and do you feel like answering? [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3109.26s)]
*  I don't mind answering. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3111.86s)]
*  I mean, I can't believe you're asking a question [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3113.14s)]
*  on Epstein at a time like this [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3114.9s)]
*  where we're having some of the greatest success [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3116.78s)]
*  and also tragedy with what happened in Texas. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3119.7400000000002s)]
*  It just seems like a desecration, but you go ahead. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3123.54s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3126.78s)]
*  Okay. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3128.86s)]
*  Trump himself promised full transparency [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3130.7000000000003s)]
*  on the Jeffrey Epstein case [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3133.26s)]
*  when he was running for president. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3134.86s)]
*  This has been a big issue on the right. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3137.42s)]
*  My friend, Dan Bongino, was one of the people [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3140.0600000000004s)]
*  who made it a big issue. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3142.42s)]
*  So did Cash Patel, talking about it [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3143.98s)]
*  over and over and over again. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3146.38s)]
*  It is just not real for Trump to pretend. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3149.5800000000004s)]
*  He's shocked this is still an issue. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3153.1000000000004s)]
*  Nothing's been resolved. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3155.42s)]
*  Nothing's been released. [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3156.86s)]
*  He promised transparency, as did his attorney general. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3158.5800000000004s)]
*  And then they release a memo saying, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3162.86s)]
*  you're not getting anything. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3164.38s)]
*  It's over, just trust us. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3165.82s)]
*  And that was not real. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3168.1800000000003s)]
*  Trump pretending he shocked [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3170.0200000000004s)]
*  that people are still interested in it. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3171.5400000000004s)]
*  Your take, Mark. [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3173.2200000000003s)]
*  Well, let me first talk about that sound bite [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3174.6600000000003s)]
*  and then the bigger issue. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3177.7000000000003s)]
*  So I'm a student of Donald Trump [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3180.5400000000004s)]
*  and how he handles public appearances, as are you. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3182.0600000000004s)]
*  I don't have the world's most sensitive spidey sense, [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3185.82s)]
*  but I got some spidey sense. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3188.62s)]
*  He regularly says, I don't like that question. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3191.62s)]
*  He does it all the time, but that was with a purpose. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3193.62s)]
*  So I don't think, and I don't see how anyone [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3197.94s)]
*  could look at that and not see an attempt by the president [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3199.9s)]
*  to intimidate the press from ever asking again about it. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3202.62s)]
*  That's how I read it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3205.54s)]
*  What are the arguments against withholding? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3208.2200000000003s)]
*  What are the arguments for transparency? [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3211.54s)]
*  MAGA really wants it. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3213.42s)]
*  I keep a running list here of all the dues organizations [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3216.26s)]
*  on the right and individuals [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3219.1s)]
*  who are demanding transparency still. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3221.38s)]
*  It's a long list and it includes many people [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3223.54s)]
*  who are typically automatically supportive of the president. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3225.9s)]
*  So MAGA wants it, his base wants it. [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3228.98s)]
*  Two, it's the right thing to do for the victims [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3231.1800000000003s)]
*  and for public trust. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3235.58s)]
*  Three, as you said, the president supported this [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3237.1s)]
*  on a regular basis. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3239.9s)]
*  And four, they said they were gonna do it. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3241.26s)]
*  So there's a credibility issue. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3243.9s)]
*  So all those things would argue [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3245.1400000000003s)]
*  for disclosure, transparency, release. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3246.6200000000003s)]
*  What's on the other side? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3250.3s)]
*  I paused, I paused pregnantly. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3253.82s)]
*  What's on the other side? [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3255.9s)]
*  What's on the other side is the suspicion [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3257.0200000000004s)]
*  that this is intended to protect rich and powerful men. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3261.1800000000003s)]
*  So I think that this could go either way. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3265.0600000000004s)]
*  The news cycle could move on. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3270.1s)]
*  MAGA often will pick fights with Donald Trump [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3272.66s)]
*  and then move on. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3275.42s)]
*  They're a resilient group. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3276.58s)]
*  And the press corps, the dominant press corps, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3280.06s)]
*  the so-called legacy media, they have for years, [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3282.34s)]
*  and they're continuing now, [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3287.46s)]
*  to be remarkably uninterested [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3288.66s)]
*  in what is both an important and interesting story, [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3290.1s)]
*  something the press corps normally covers. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3292.34s)]
*  So I think it could go either way. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3295.1s)]
*  This could disappear. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3297.2999999999997s)]
*  And those who don't want further disclosure [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3298.42s)]
*  could have their way slash get away with it. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3300.46s)]
*  Or those demanding justice and disclosure [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3303.7400000000002s)]
*  could get their way. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3308.86s)]
*  I don't know which way it's gonna go. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3309.82s)]
*  But again, I'll go back to the first thing I said. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3311.26s)]
*  That was a remarkable performance by the president. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3313.3s)]
*  It was an obvious attempt to deflect [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3316.7000000000003s)]
*  and to set the messaging [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3319.7000000000003s)]
*  like we're not talking about Epstein anymore, period. [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3321.2200000000003s)]
*  And I'm the head of MAGA, and that's what I say. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3324.2200000000003s)]
*  But it's too late. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3326.22s)]
*  That animal has already been created, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3328.2599999999998s)]
*  and it's pretty ferocious. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3329.9399999999996s)]
*  It's not going to be tamed just by one line [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3331.7s)]
*  from the president at a cabinet meeting. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3334.58s)]
*  He helped create it. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3336.22s)]
*  He helped inspired it. [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3337.62s)]
*  His top lieutenants helped create it. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3338.58s)]
*  And we too have been watching the reaction [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3340.8599999999997s)]
*  amongst the most faithful supporters of the president. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3343.8599999999997s)]
*  We put together a butted sound by, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3347.1s)]
*  in this you'll hear names you, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3348.2999999999997s)]
*  you'll hear from names that you know. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3349.98s)]
*  The only one who doesn't seem to be demanding more [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3351.8599999999997s)]
*  is our friend Ben Shapiro, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3355.66s)]
*  but you'll hear almost a uniform tone [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3357.2599999999998s)]
*  from literally almost everyone else on the right. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3361.06s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3363.58s)]
*  Nobody told us prior to this that the Epstein files [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3364.54s)]
*  will be anywhere even on the agenda for that day. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3368.06s)]
*  And it was really sprung as a surprise to all of us. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3371.46s)]
*  We could handed these binders. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3374.06s)]
*  And then before we even have a chance to look into them, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3375.5s)]
*  we're hauled out actually in front of the cameras [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3379.18s)]
*  that were all there. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3382.22s)]
*  We don't have the accountability that was spoken of. [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3383.06s)]
*  We don't have the releases that were spoken of. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3384.9s)]
*  And it's just, it's indefensible. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3387.54s)]
*  It's indefensible that the answers aren't there [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3388.7400000000002s)]
*  when so much was promised. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3391.02s)]
*  As someone who voted for the president, [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3392.38s)]
*  campaigned for the president a lot, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3394.62s)]
*  I'm not attacking the president. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3397.5s)]
*  But I think even people who are fully on board with, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3398.6600000000003s)]
*  you know, the bulk of the MAGA agenda are like, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3402.86s)]
*  this is too much actually. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3405.42s)]
*  Yes, yes. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3406.7000000000003s)]
*  I'm saying that with love [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3407.54s)]
*  and I hope that they're listening [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3408.62s)]
*  because I think this threatens to blow up the whole thing. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3411.14s)]
*  The other way when Pam Bondi went on television [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3413.34s)]
*  and said, I have a video tape of kids getting abused. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3415.02s)]
*  I follow this case closely [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3418.54s)]
*  and I know a lot of the people involved as I've told you. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3419.7000000000003s)]
*  I had no idea. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3423.02s)]
*  I didn't know that really thousands of children got raped. [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3423.86s)]
*  Who raped them? [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3427.7400000000002s)]
*  Where are the rapists? [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3428.6600000000003s)]
*  Like, why aren't they in jail? [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3429.6200000000003s)]
*  This is the Department of Justice. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3431.1800000000003s)]
*  Yes. [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3433.2200000000003s)]
*  That is so crazy. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3434.06s)]
*  This is like, this is honestly one of the craziest things [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3435.94s)]
*  I've ever seen in my entire life. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3438.98s)]
*  And I just think it's very dangerous [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3441.06s)]
*  to play around with this stuff. [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3444.1s)]
*  Can't the Department of Justice move to unseal things [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3445.34s)]
*  that were put under seal? [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3448.5s)]
*  Isn't that technically the way [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3450.14s)]
*  that this could potentially be brought to the public? [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3452.46s)]
*  Because I think we need mass disclosure. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3454.7s)]
*  I think we need more information. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3456.22s)]
*  At least for my under 30 crowd, I know my demo. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3457.74s)]
*  They are volcanic over this whole thing. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3460.38s)]
*  And by the way, the over 60 crowd, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3462.62s)]
*  they're like Epstein, whatever, not a big deal. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3464.54s)]
*  No, but under 30, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3466.38s)]
*  can you explain that to our audience too, Mike? [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3467.42s)]
*  If you're willing to throw that over and claim they're lying, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3469.18s)]
*  then I'd like to see you present your evidence [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3471.46s)]
*  that they are in fact lying. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3473.62s)]
*  Because I know Dan, I don't think that Dan Bagino [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3474.74s)]
*  is lying to me. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3476.8199999999997s)]
*  I know Cash Patel a little bit. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3479.5s)]
*  I don't think Cash Patel is lying to me. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3480.7s)]
*  I don't think these people are lying to me. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3483.06s)]
*  Which means that if somebody else continues to claim [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3484.9s)]
*  that they're lying, [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3486.74s)]
*  they ought to provide their evidence at this point. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3487.58s)]
*  Pam Bondi needs to be fired. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3489.2999999999997s)]
*  Who is rolling this out, the little rascal? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3491.98s)]
*  Who is rolling this out, the little rascals? [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3496.26s)]
*  Pinky, look, I got some video tape. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3502.42s)]
*  What are you doing? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3505.1800000000003s)]
*  This is ridiculous. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3506.98s)]
*  Really interesting, right Mark? [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3511.46s)]
*  Yeah, every time I see Ben Shapiro, [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3513.94s)]
*  I think maybe I should adopt more of his voice for my show. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3515.7000000000003s)]
*  I feel like he's onto something with that voice. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3518.86s)]
*  You know, as you and I have talked about, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3522.54s)]
*  you know, Charlie and Tucker are extremely influential [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3524.74s)]
*  with the administration. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3527.06s)]
*  And when they say not just the morally right thing to do, [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3528.18s)]
*  but the demand of the base is more disclosure. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3531.62s)]
*  And then, but Ben gives voice to the reality for some, [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3535.22s)]
*  which is Pam Bondi is taking a lot more heat [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3540.2999999999997s)]
*  than Cash Patel and Dan are, a lot more. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3542.74s)]
*  And yet they're out there with more specificity saying, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3545.8599999999997s)]
*  trust us, case closed. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3548.74s)]
*  So I'll continue to watch to see how they handle this. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3551.74s)]
*  The president endorsed them on True Social the other day, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3554.46s)]
*  not specifically on this issue, but in general. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3557.38s)]
*  Not her. [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3559.42s)]
*  But not her, although he was pretty friendly [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3560.74s)]
*  in the cabinet room. [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3562.86s)]
*  But he knew she was twisting by a string [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3565.38s)]
*  and he did not send out a nice tweet about her. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3567.9s)]
*  Now you didn't include Laura Loomer in your mashup. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3570.54s)]
*  Could've. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3574.46s)]
*  She is much derided, obviously, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3575.2999999999997s)]
*  and there are people in the White House [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3577.66s)]
*  who don't like her influence, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3578.9s)]
*  but she doesn't lose that often. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3580.02s)]
*  She doesn't lose that often. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3582.94s)]
*  And she's very hept up about this. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3584.06s)]
*  But I'll say again, there's a lot of- [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3586.18s)]
*  She wants Bondi fired. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3588.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3589.58s)]
*  There are a lot of mag obsessions [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3590.42s)]
*  that aren't necessarily in the public interest [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3591.98s)]
*  or aren't rooted in truth, justice in the American way. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3594.3s)]
*  This is a real thing. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3598.62s)]
*  And Tucker, I think, gave voice to it. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3600.38s)]
*  Like forget the conspiracy theories, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3602.14s)]
*  just deal with the reality of how this man was treated [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3605.22s)]
*  by the criminal justice system [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3608.74s)]
*  and how discouraging that was not just to the victims, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3610.8599999999997s)]
*  but to people who believe in justice [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3615.3799999999997s)]
*  and people who believe in the American system [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3617.2999999999997s)]
*  treating people fairly. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3619.18s)]
*  Like this requires extraordinarily detailed care [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3620.5s)]
*  and disclosure. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3625.58s)]
*  And the administration, after championing it [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3627.02s)]
*  and after knowing full well how important it was, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3629.8599999999997s)]
*  as Charlie said to so many Americans, [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3632.02s)]
*  regardless of their political affiliation, [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3635.02s)]
*  is basically saying trust this case closed. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3636.82s)]
*  And it could sustain, but I don't think it will. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3639.2200000000003s)]
*  And I don't think it should, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3642.7400000000002s)]
*  because imagine the status quo [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3644.5800000000004s)]
*  and what that will do to people's lack of trust [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3646.94s)]
*  in the government and commitments that have been made. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3650.1000000000004s)]
*  Listening to the theorizing around it [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3655.6200000000003s)]
*  has been fascinating. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3658.1000000000004s)]
*  Just this morning, I was listening to Scott Adams, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3659.02s)]
*  creator of Dilbert and also just very bright [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3661.1400000000003s)]
*  social commentator. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3663.42s)]
*  And he was saying, let's just say, without evidence, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3664.5s)]
*  he was very open, but this is just a theory. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3668.98s)]
*  Let's just say that there is some Israel connection [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3671.3s)]
*  with Epstein. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3675.7s)]
*  Like he was an agent something, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3676.86s)]
*  collecting compromise on various people. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3678.86s)]
*  And he went to Trump and said, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3682.46s)]
*  you gotta make this go away. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3684.98s)]
*  And Trump went to Bongino and Patel and Bondi and said, [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3686.9s)]
*  for the sake of peace in the Middle East, [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3691.38s)]
*  we're moving on. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3693.94s)]
*  There's nothing to see here. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3695.82s)]
*  And that's what I want you to say. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3697.5s)]
*  Would I consider that a lie I couldn't forgive? [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3699.06s)]
*  That's a Scott Adams still. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3702.26s)]
*  No, I wouldn't, he said. [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3703.5s)]
*  I mean, the president, this is total speculation, [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3705.78s)]
*  but the president going to those three and saying, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3708.1800000000003s)]
*  it's over, I don't care what you say, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3710.38s)]
*  but you have to make it go away, we're moving on, [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3713.26s)]
*  would explain the way all three have behaved [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3715.78s)]
*  over the past couple of weeks. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3719.42s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3721.58s)]
*  Again, if they're telling the truth [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3722.94s)]
*  and they really believe that the right thing for the world [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3725.9s)]
*  is to say, there's nothing to see here, [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3728.58s)]
*  didn't commit suicide, wasn't murdered, [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3731.1s)]
*  didn't have a list, nothing more to disclose [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3733.62s)]
*  that would be good for the public to know, [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3736.1s)]
*  then they're doing a crap job explaining why. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3738.38s)]
*  They're doing a crap job giving us confidence. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3741.74s)]
*  There needs to be long interviews, long press conferences, [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3744.62s)]
*  not just a statement and not just short disclosure. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3748.18s)]
*  And they need to walk through it all. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3751.8199999999997s)]
*  Pam Bondi yesterday says, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3753.2599999999998s)]
*  well, there's a minute gap every day, maybe, [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3754.2999999999997s)]
*  but minute gap is something that is not going to go away [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3757.3399999999997s)]
*  without a really clear explanation. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3761.74s)]
*  She dropped that like it was a nothing. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3764.54s)]
*  Everybody was like, wait, what? [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3766.2599999999998s)]
*  It's real? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3768.14s)]
*  The minute before midnight thing is real? [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3768.98s)]
*  And you thought you were just going to get away with it? [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3770.7799999999997s)]
*  Every night. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3772.8199999999997s)]
*  On Next Up, there's a minute gap every episode [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3773.66s)]
*  where I tell my best jokes and the producers cut them out. [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3775.54s)]
*  And someone winds up dead, FYI. [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3779.18s)]
*  Someone dies at the end of every episode. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3782.1s)]
*  Again, the Mossad thing in my world, [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3785.22s)]
*  the Mossad thing's very big as a matter of speculation. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3787.2599999999998s)]
*  But the other speculation is, [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3790.98s)]
*  as my friend Dan Turntine says, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3793.1s)]
*  Donald Trump has deep affiliations [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3795.5s)]
*  where Jeffrey Epstein did in South Florida [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3798.94s)]
*  and on the Upper East Side of New York City. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3800.7s)]
*  And so maybe he's trying to protect friends. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3802.98s)]
*  Now, some people say he's trying to protect himself. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3805.22s)]
*  No idea. [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3807.2999999999997s)]
*  But as I said before, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3808.22s)]
*  there needs to be an explanation for what they're doing [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3809.78s)]
*  because all the equities, all of the logic, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3812.34s)]
*  all the doing the right thing [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3816.46s)]
*  falls on the side of disclosure. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3818.6200000000003s)]
*  So if they're telling the truth, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3820.7400000000002s)]
*  if they're confident that there is nothing more to disclose [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3823.0600000000004s)]
*  that would be in the public interest to know, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3826.42s)]
*  they need to do a better job of walking us through that [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3828.7000000000003s)]
*  and not just saying to reporters, how dare you ask? [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3832.1400000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm. [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3836.42s)]
*  This has been getting bandied about on X quite a bit. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3839.38s)]
*  Elon, as I mentioned, has weighed in on a couple of people. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3842.42s)]
*  I didn't know that Roger Stone, longtime Trump advisor, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3846.66s)]
*  also hates Steve Bannon. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3851.86s)]
*  Elon hates Steve. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3853.54s)]
*  Roger hates Elon. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3855.42s)]
*  Just for the record, I like them all. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3859.14s)]
*  Okay. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3862.42s)]
*  So Roger, sorry, Roger doesn't hate Elon. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3863.2599999999998s)]
*  Roger hates Bannon. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3865.98s)]
*  Yeah, no, I mean, I got no horse in this race, [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3866.82s)]
*  but I think it's interesting to watch. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3869.26s)]
*  And here is what happened between them yesterday. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3871.1000000000004s)]
*  Elon tweeted, how can people be expected to have faith [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3874.3s)]
*  in Trump if he won't release the Epstein files? [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3876.86s)]
*  Someone responded, will exposing the Epstein files [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3878.86s)]
*  rank high on the America party's list? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3881.7000000000003s)]
*  Musk says 100%. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3884.46s)]
*  Then Elon tweeted out, Bannon is in the Epstein files, [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3886.1400000000003s)]
*  but didn't offer any evidence to back it up. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3889.6200000000003s)]
*  But he was responding to tweets from Roger Stone as follows, [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3891.9s)]
*  why would Bannon meet with Jeffrey Epstein, [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3895.1s)]
*  both at his New York home and in Paris [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3897.82s)]
*  after Epstein was convicted on sex crimes in Florida? [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3899.9s)]
*  Why would he coach Epstein for his 60 minutes appearance? [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3902.9s)]
*  This appears to stem from a 2021 book by Michael Wolff [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3906.2599999999998s)]
*  that Bannon helped Epstein prepare [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3910.1s)]
*  for a CBS 60 minutes interview that never happened. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3913.1s)]
*  And it's quoting here, I believe quoting Bannon, quote, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3917.54s)]
*  you're engaging, you're not threatening, you're a natural, [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3920.9s)]
*  you're friendly, you don't look at all creepy, [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3923.86s)]
*  you're a sympathetic figure, said Bannon during the early [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3926.46s)]
*  2019 coaching and feedback session per the book. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3929.6600000000003s)]
*  Bannon confirmed to the New York Times [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3932.7400000000002s)]
*  that he encouraged Epstein to do a 60 minutes interview [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3934.94s)]
*  and recorded more than 15 hours of interviews [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3937.7400000000002s)]
*  with the disgraced financier. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3940.6200000000003s)]
*  Bannon told the New York Times, however, [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3943.2200000000003s)]
*  that he never did media train anyone [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3945.1400000000003s)]
*  and was instead working on the unannounced documentary [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3947.46s)]
*  to demonstrate how Epstein's quote, perversions [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3952.46s)]
*  and depravity toward young women were part of a life [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3955.5s)]
*  that was systematically supported, encouraged, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3959.06s)]
*  and rewarded by a global establishment [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3961.26s)]
*  that dined off of his money and his influence. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3963.5s)]
*  That's kind of mind blowing, 15 hours of tape [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3967.98s)]
*  and Bannon today was critical. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3971.5s)]
*  I watched his show yesterday, he was critical [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3973.42s)]
*  of the way this is being handled [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3975.58s)]
*  and was demanding more transparency. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3976.86s)]
*  But the point is simply this thing has tentacles, [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3979.1s)]
*  that reach deep, pretty much everywhere. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3983.34s)]
*  And I don't know, Mark, whether we're ever gonna have it [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3986.26s)]
*  fully figured out. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3988.78s)]
*  Well, it's hard to know, because this administration [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3990.9s)]
*  doesn't seem on track to do it. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3993.3s)]
*  They could reverse course, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3994.7000000000003s)]
*  could be another taco situation. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3997.54s)]
*  I doubt the press will do it, [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=3999.7400000000002s)]
*  because some press has tried. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4001.46s)]
*  It's hard, right? [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4004.3s)]
*  No subpoena power. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4005.1400000000003s)]
*  I don't know that Congress is gonna do it. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4006.1800000000003s)]
*  I don't know that any prosecutor's gonna do it. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4008.2200000000003s)]
*  Tom Fitton is saying he's gonna do it. [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4011.22s)]
*  Who? [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4013.2599999999998s)]
*  Tom Fitton, Judicial Watch. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4014.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, Tom, Judicial Watch should try, [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4016.4199999999996s)]
*  but their main bag of tricks involves [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4019.8999999999996s)]
*  trying to get courts to do things. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4021.7799999999997s)]
*  I think that somebody would have to engage [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4023.5s)]
*  in a pretty thorough effort with subpoena power, ideally, [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4027.8199999999997s)]
*  to figure out what to do. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4031.8999999999996s)]
*  But it starts with the executive branch, right? [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4034.06s)]
*  Because they've got access to all these documents, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4037.1s)]
*  which they say aren't gonna be released. [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4038.74s)]
*  So, [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4040.82s)]
*  the tale will be told by whether [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4045.46s)]
*  the administration changes its posture. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4047.7000000000003s)]
*  If the president and the Justice Department, the FBI, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4050.1800000000003s)]
*  continue to say case closed, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4052.86s)]
*  then the ball's gonna move to another court. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4054.94s)]
*  But they're in the best position to do something about it. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4057.5800000000004s)]
*  And as for the fights amongst people like Bannon and Stone, [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4061.98s)]
*  I've got some friends who don't like each other, [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4066.54s)]
*  and pretty strongly in a couple cases. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4069.3399999999997s)]
*  But the president has just an enormous capacity [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4072.5s)]
*  to be friends with both Heckle and Jekyll, [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4075.02s)]
*  and the Hatfields and the McCoys. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4078.3799999999997s)]
*  And that's just part of the colorful salon [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4080.2599999999998s)]
*  surrounding our president. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4084.2999999999997s)]
*  I just feel like no one's gonna subpoena anyone [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4086.2599999999998s)]
*  because the Democrats probably have [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4088.7s)]
*  too many high-ranking people on their side [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4090.18s)]
*  who they're worried are in those files. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4092.7s)]
*  And clearly the Republicans may have [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4094.58s)]
*  some bodies buried there, too. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4096.42s)]
*  Although your best friend, Jamie Raskin, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4098.62s)]
*  and some other House Democrats [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4100.38s)]
*  did write to the Justice Department [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4102.3s)]
*  or the White House, I don't know which, administration, [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4104.0599999999995s)]
*  joining the chorus of those saying, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4106.34s)]
*  "'Please release everything.'" [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4109.46s)]
*  So if they're worried about Democrats, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4110.58s)]
*  they're not acting like they are. [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4113.26s)]
*  Well, they don't have subpoena power right now. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4114.74s)]
*  They're not in control. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4116.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4118.0599999999995s)]
*  So let's see what they do [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4118.94s)]
*  if and when they win back the House. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4120.42s)]
*  I do think the president's going to hear more from people. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4123.46s)]
*  I don't think you see people standing down on this [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4126.66s)]
*  on the right. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4129.06s)]
*  The biggest mistake Pam Bondi made [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4129.900000000001s)]
*  was dragging those influencers into the White House [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4131.740000000001s)]
*  and humiliating them. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4135.1s)]
*  They're keeping score. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4136.740000000001s)]
*  I started that clip with Jack Posobiak, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4137.66s)]
*  who was one of them. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4139.34s)]
*  Liz Wheeler is another. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4140.46s)]
*  She'll be on this program tomorrow [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4141.46s)]
*  telling us the full story of what happened there. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4142.820000000001s)]
*  It's not as we thought. [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4144.46s)]
*  It's actually a little different, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4145.38s)]
*  and she's gonna tell. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4146.780000000001s)]
*  But I think they're rightfully pissed off [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4148.7s)]
*  on what was done to them. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4151.54s)]
*  And the only way it could have been fixed [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4152.38s)]
*  was if then Pam Bondi did deliver, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4153.66s)]
*  did make good on her promise [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4156.62s)]
*  to give the Epstein files to them. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4158.82s)]
*  And instead they got stiff armed, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4160.9s)]
*  just like everybody else. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4163.38s)]
*  And I just want to make one other comment [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4164.22s)]
*  on what Tucker was saying in that clip [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4165.34s)]
*  with Sagar and Jeddy on his show, on Tucker's show. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4166.7s)]
*  My understanding on the children, [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4170.54s)]
*  the child sexual assault material, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4172.74s)]
*  child pornography we used to call it, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4174.82s)]
*  is that they have tens of thousands of images [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4176.82s)]
*  on Jeffrey Epstein's computer [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4181.0599999999995s)]
*  that prove the guy was into that stuff. [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4183.62s)]
*  That he was looking at highly contrabanded materials [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4186.9s)]
*  of young children. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4191.82s)]
*  And that is a new disclosure. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4193.94s)]
*  And Pam Bondi had referenced it [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4196.58s)]
*  when caught on tape with James O'Keefe, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4198.34s)]
*  and then she went to the microphones herself [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4199.94s)]
*  and said it so that she couldn't look like [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4201.54s)]
*  she was gotten by James O'Keefe. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4203.58s)]
*  But now they're saying it more explicitly. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4205.54s)]
*  That's what they're referring to. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4207.18s)]
*  I have no reason to believe these are, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4208.7s)]
*  and in fact I believe it's the opposite, [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4211.9s)]
*  that these were Jeffrey Epstein victims in person. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4214.42s)]
*  It was his chosen pornography. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4218.42s)]
*  It's disgusting, but that's that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4221.9s)]
*  What they're saying in the memo is that there are [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4225.219999999999s)]
*  about 1,000 Jeffrey Epstein victims, actual victims, [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4228.82s)]
*  and by that they mean young women. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4233.259999999999s)]
*  Again, I've been describing them as barely legal, [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4235.339999999999s)]
*  because somebody very close to the case told me [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4238.219999999999s)]
*  that's what he was into. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4239.98s)]
*  In terms of actual physical interactions, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4242.1s)]
*  it was the barely legal type, [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4243.86s)]
*  like the 17, 18-year-olds who looked 14. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4245.06s)]
*  Then there are over 1,000 victims like that [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4249.62s)]
*  who were brought into the Epstein mansion. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4252.66s)]
*  And the typical MO, we've learned this throughout the cases, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4254.74s)]
*  is they would be brought into the Epstein property, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4257.34s)]
*  they would be funneled into some room, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4259.66s)]
*  they would be paid, these young girls would be paid [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4261.14s)]
*  to give Jeffrey Epstein an X-rated massage. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4264.06s)]
*  They were sort of lured, many of them being told [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4267.0199999999995s)]
*  it's just gonna be a massage. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4269.42s)]
*  And you can make some extra money, and they would do it. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4271.820000000001s)]
*  And then it would turn X-rated. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4273.26s)]
*  Mostly it was just these girls pleasuring Jeffrey Epstein. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4276.46s)]
*  It wasn't like an actual sex act. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4279.5s)]
*  Forgive me for getting graphic, [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4281.3s)]
*  but this is what the evidence has been. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4282.34s)]
*  So that's what they're talking about. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4285.66s)]
*  Just to distinguish, I have yet to hear anything [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4286.5s)]
*  putting a number of victims that Jeffrey or Ghislaine [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4288.860000000001s)]
*  farmed out to other men. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4292.06s)]
*  Now that's not to say Megyn Kelly knows there were none. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4294.18s)]
*  It's just I have never heard any specifics on that. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4296.9400000000005s)]
*  I've heard the names, like the guy who owned Victoria's Secret, [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4300.42s)]
*  how he was down at Epstein Island, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4304.26s)]
*  and I've heard a Bill Gates connection, [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4306.22s)]
*  all that, that everybody else has heard too. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4308.74s)]
*  I just haven't seen the proof that shows, [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4310.7s)]
*  and this person was farmed out, a young girl, [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4313.82s)]
*  participated in the trafficking of a young girl. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4316.54s)]
*  There's Virginia Jouffre, who was definitely [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4318.78s)]
*  one of Epstein's victims, and was in a photo [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4322.9400000000005s)]
*  with Prince Andrew, and Prince Andrew himself [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4326.54s)]
*  has been just all over the board on this [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4328.74s)]
*  and clearly isn't being 100% honest. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4330.98s)]
*  But she's also dishonest. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4332.78s)]
*  She's passed now, so forgive me, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4334.139999999999s)]
*  but she was definitely lying in part [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4335.94s)]
*  about her experiences in the Epstein lair. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4338.58s)]
*  She's the one who accused Alan Dershowitz [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4342.179999999999s)]
*  after somebody else came to her and said, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4344.099999999999s)]
*  why didn't she include Alan Dershowitz? [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4345.74s)]
*  That would really get you some attention. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4347.099999999999s)]
*  That's how he got looped in. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4348.58s)]
*  She wound up dismissing that case, saying, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4349.66s)]
*  oh, I may have misremembered. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4351.38s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz totally had disproven her allegations. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4352.98s)]
*  He could prove he wasn't even anywhere near [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4355.34s)]
*  any of Epstein's properties on the day she said she saw him [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4358.9400000000005s)]
*  and was with him and all that stuff. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4361.22s)]
*  So anyway, the whole thing is just such a morass, Mark, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4362.34s)]
*  that I, as a lawyer, I just want to follow actual facts [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4365.38s)]
*  and actual evidence, and that hasn't made it all that clear [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4369.7s)]
*  to me other than what I've said. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4372.62s)]
*  Yeah, and I'll put some responsibility [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4374.5s)]
*  on the shoulders of the Florida prosecutors [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4378.1s)]
*  and the federal prosecutors who had subpoena power [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4379.900000000001s)]
*  and I wish had been clearer about what the conduct was. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4383.22s)]
*  And who knows why they didn't? [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4388.62s)]
*  I mean, it could be they or somebody they knew [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4390.38s)]
*  was compromised. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4392.900000000001s)]
*  It could be he was an intelligence agent. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4393.900000000001s)]
*  That was a very weird thing of Pam Bondi's answer yesterday, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4396.660000000001s)]
*  which we didn't play today, but we played it yesterday [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4400.34s)]
*  where she was like, oh, as for your question [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4402.06s)]
*  about whether he was an agent, I haven't looked into that. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4404.02s)]
*  I'll get back to you on that. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4407.34s)]
*  What? [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4408.46s)]
*  This is one of the main theories about him. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4409.46s)]
*  I mean, how do I, as a member of the press know that? [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4411.820000000001s)]
*  You know it, the audience knows it, [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4414.46s)]
*  and Pam Bondi doesn't know that. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4416.26s)]
*  That was a lie. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4417.54s)]
*  She does know. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4418.38s)]
*  So why didn't she tell? [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4419.66s)]
*  Again, raising more questions than answers, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4420.9400000000005s)]
*  including about the minute before midnight, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4423.22s)]
*  which we decided yesterday is a great name for a movie [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4425.66s)]
*  about this whole thing. [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4427.58s)]
*  And we just showed the audience while you were talking [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4428.58s)]
*  that we went back and found the tape [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4430.58s)]
*  where you can see the jump cut. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4432.18s)]
*  There is, there's a cut. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4433.26s)]
*  There's a minute before midnight [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4435.22s)]
*  that was cut out of the Epstein jail cell. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4436.9400000000005s)]
*  Happens every night. [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4438.74s)]
*  So if you wanted to kill Jeffrey Epstein, [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4440.5s)]
*  you would know you had the minute before midnight. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4442.26s)]
*  My one caution on the whole jail cell, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4445.1s)]
*  the jail cell video is have you seen the two guards? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4448.3s)]
*  Have you seen these two guys? [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4452.7s)]
*  Like it's a gallon a guy. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4453.94s)]
*  They are, forgive me, but they're like obese, [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4455.9s)]
*  classic civil servant looking people in New York. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4458.86s)]
*  Their excuse is we were surfing the net and asleep, [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4461.98s)]
*  which is why we weren't really monitoring what was going, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4466.7s)]
*  which I totally believe. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4469.0199999999995s)]
*  And the opposite requires me to believe [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4471.22s)]
*  that maybe they were in on this conspiracy. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4473.22s)]
*  They allowed somebody to get in there all this time. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4475.34s)]
*  They've managed to keep their mouth shut. [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4478.1s)]
*  They haven't leaked it to anybody. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4480.38s)]
*  I have a hard time buying it. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4483.820000000001s)]
*  I hear you, but I tend to think of it the opposite way, [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4485.18s)]
*  which is to me, they're the weak link [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4488.06s)]
*  in those who want to dismiss the probability [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4490.900000000001s)]
*  of possibility he was killed, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4493.900000000001s)]
*  because the series of events that had to occur on their end [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4495.5s)]
*  to allow him to kill himself undetected. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4500.42s)]
*  It's just, it's too much for me. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4503.58s)]
*  It's just too many different. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4505.46s)]
*  That, I think incompetence, [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4506.9400000000005s)]
*  that's all that it requires you to believe, very easy. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4508.22s)]
*  Requires, it requires a level of incompetence [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4511.14s)]
*  over a long period of time that's possible, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4514.7s)]
*  but in conjunction with him not having someone [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4518.46s)]
*  in the cell with him, in conjunction with the one minute gap, [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4522.5s)]
*  it's too much. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4525.62s)]
*  It's what someone inclined to use cliches [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4526.46s)]
*  would call a perfect storm, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4530.900000000001s)]
*  that they would be that 100% derelict [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4532.1s)]
*  in what they were supposed to do for that length of time [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4534.780000000001s)]
*  on this particular case. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4537.5s)]
*  Mark Halpern, have you ever been to the post office [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4538.820000000001s)]
*  in New York City? The post office, I have. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4543.06s)]
*  The DMV in New York City? I have. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4544.9400000000005s)]
*  I have, and I understand what you're saying, [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4547.34s)]
*  although my post office in New York City [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4549.02s)]
*  is actually pretty good. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4551.54s)]
*  So I've become a little bit less suspect of civil service. [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4552.860000000001s)]
*  I hear what you're saying. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4558.219999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying go look at the accounts given [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4559.299999999999s)]
*  of all the things they had to do wrong for this to happen. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4562.78s)]
*  It's a lot of stuff. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4566.42s)]
*  I was like, yeah, seems right. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4567.259999999999s)]
*  You can see them on the tape, surfing the net, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4568.62s)]
*  ones asleep, but like, yeah, that looks about right on brand. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4570.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4573.86s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4574.7s)]
*  The biggest thing for me is the autopsy [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4575.54s)]
*  that Jeffrey Epstein's brother had done [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4578.0199999999995s)]
*  with Dr. Biden saying this looks like a murder. [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4579.82s)]
*  You be Nancy Drew, I'll be a Hardy boy. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4582.38s)]
*  All those things had to happen. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4585.0199999999995s)]
*  When he wanted to kill himself, right? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4586.86s)]
*  In other words, how did he know [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4588.78s)]
*  that they were going to be so down on the job [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4591.0199999999995s)]
*  that he had an opportunity to kill himself? [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4593.7s)]
*  He was also a New Yorker. [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4596.0599999999995s)]
*  And he just said, I know they're going to fall asleep [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4598.78s)]
*  and search the web, so now's my chance. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4601.0199999999995s)]
*  He took a shot. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4603.099999999999s)]
*  No, he was like, he'd been there for a while, Mark. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4603.94s)]
*  He's like, they don't come in, they ignore me. [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4606.78s)]
*  I know they're going to be asleep. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4610.0199999999995s)]
*  They never bothered me between 12 and 15. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4612.139999999999s)]
*  But they did, they did. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4614.099999999999s)]
*  They never bothered me between 12 and three. [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4615.259999999999s)]
*  Now's my chance. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4617.339999999999s)]
*  They didn't do that every night. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4618.58s)]
*  That's the thing. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4619.7s)]
*  They didn't do it every night. [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4620.54s)]
*  There's no documentation. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4621.98s)]
*  We don't know that they did it every night. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4623.54s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4625.219999999999s)]
*  So he's taken a chance to try to kill himself saying, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4626.0599999999995s)]
*  chances are they're not going to come in and stop me. [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4629.9s)]
*  I'm not saying he didn't kill himself. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4632.94s)]
*  I'm just saying, it's like the guy who shot at Trump. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4634.219999999999s)]
*  There's all this stuff that had to happen [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4639.46s)]
*  for him to be able to shoot at Trump. [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4642.58s)]
*  And it all happened. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4644.46s)]
*  It just seems a little weird. [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4646.14s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4647.74s)]
*  Well, I don't disagree. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4648.58s)]
*  I'm just trying to strongman the other position [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4649.42s)]
*  because I also have questions about whether Jeffrey Epstein [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4651.42s)]
*  really killed himself. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4653.86s)]
*  And in particular that Dr. Biden autopsy for me. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4654.74s)]
*  Because that's actual proof. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4657.900000000001s)]
*  Now we're talking real hardcore evidence. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4658.9400000000005s)]
*  The absence of other things can be evidence too. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4661.54s)]
*  But that's the thing I've never gotten pie. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4664.9800000000005s)]
*  And look, it's possible that the brother got to him [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4666.5s)]
*  and said, I really want this to come out [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4669.18s)]
*  the following way and Biden did it. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4670.86s)]
*  But how often in the history of suicide, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4673.06s)]
*  how often in the history of suicides, [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4675.06s)]
*  including prison suicides, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4678.18s)]
*  have you heard an account of someone caught in the act [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4679.820000000001s)]
*  and stopped? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4682.660000000001s)]
*  How often have you heard of that happening? [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4683.5s)]
*  I can't think of a single example of it. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4686.18s)]
*  Never, yeah. [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4687.820000000001s)]
*  Right? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4688.9400000000005s)]
*  So again, even if he said, yeah, those two are clowns. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4689.780000000001s)]
*  They probably won't come in. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4693.900000000001s)]
*  Here's my chance. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4695.14s)]
*  They could have come in. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4697.1s)]
*  They could have heard something. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4697.9400000000005s)]
*  There might not have been a one minute gap. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4699.42s)]
*  So again, if the story of their role is accurate, [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4702.02s)]
*  he somehow made a great calculated guess [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4709.38s)]
*  that they wouldn't come in and stop him. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4711.860000000001s)]
*  Because if they had, he'd be the first person [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4713.42s)]
*  you and I have ever heard of stopped in the act [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4715.34s)]
*  of trying to kill himself. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4717.900000000001s)]
*  Steve Krakow was reminding me that he did have [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4719.34s)]
*  a failed suicide attempt the month before. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4721.780000000001s)]
*  Allegedly. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4725.42s)]
*  Did they walk in on him during that attempt, Steve? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4726.26s)]
*  Do you remember that? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4731.02s)]
*  Or was it just like he tried and they knew? [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4731.860000000001s)]
*  We don't know, okay. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4734.620000000001s)]
*  I don't believe that was documented. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4735.700000000001s)]
*  Why can't Pan Bondi, Cash Patel and Dan Bongino [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4738.700000000001s)]
*  either sit down for a long interview [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4742.540000000001s)]
*  with yours truly or someone else, or have a presser? [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4744.46s)]
*  Have a presser and just answer all these questions, Mark, [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4747.34s)]
*  if there's nothing to hide. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4749.740000000001s)]
*  Let it all hang out. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4750.860000000001s)]
*  But we know what the answer is. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4752.42s)]
*  They don't want to. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4754.740000000001s)]
*  Someone told them not to. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4755.580000000001s)]
*  Yeah, well, and I think President Trump made clear [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4756.42s)]
*  he's totally on board with this strategy, [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4758.18s)]
*  which means he likely directed it. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4760.02s)]
*  And the question remains why. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4761.780000000001s)]
*  I'm offended by this segment, Megan. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4763.9800000000005s)]
*  Just kidding. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4766.38s)]
*  That we've continued talking about it [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4768.06s)]
*  after President Trump said not to? [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4769.660000000001s)]
*  President Trump warned us, extolled, urged. [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4771.14s)]
*  Yeah, no. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4777.34s)]
*  I mean, if they can't have a press conference [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4778.26s)]
*  or do a long interview with documentation, [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4780.620000000001s)]
*  they need to take it up with Charlie and Tucker and you. [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4783.46s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the thing. [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4787.02s)]
*  It's like most of us don't actually just follow orders. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4788.26s)]
*  Most of us have our own independent judgment [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4791.900000000001s)]
*  and editorial sensibility, and this is one of those things. [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4793.74s)]
*  I'll be curious to see the next White House reporter [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4797.900000000001s)]
*  who asks in front of the president about Jeffrey Epstein. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4799.9800000000005s)]
*  Let's see when the next happens. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4803.7s)]
*  Same. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4805.58s)]
*  I mean, it's funny, because I was just looking. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4806.42s)]
*  Some of the people on my YouTube feed will say, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4808.820000000001s)]
*  oh, she never responds. [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4810.66s)]
*  But I actually do look at the comments. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4811.860000000001s)]
*  But I never do respond to the YouTube comments, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4813.46s)]
*  because I never surf the net under my real email, [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4815.9s)]
*  because sometimes it shows your email, [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4821.139999999999s)]
*  and then people have your email, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4822.98s)]
*  and I'm like, well, I don't want that. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4823.9s)]
*  But anyway, I do listen to your comments. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4826.42s)]
*  I read your comments, everybody, on YouTube and elsewhere. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4828.099999999999s)]
*  And I see what people are thinking. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4830.259999999999s)]
*  It's actually a very good tool to see generally [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4834.62s)]
*  how people are feeling about a story. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4836.5s)]
*  And for the first time yesterday, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4837.86s)]
*  I started to see more like, move on, move on. [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4839.339999999999s)]
*  Okay, those are true Trump loyalists, [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4843.9s)]
*  because there's just still so many questions. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4846.219999999999s)]
*  But also, as Charlie said, [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4849.259999999999s)]
*  not everybody is interested in this story [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4852.62s)]
*  about this one guy. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4855.299999999999s)]
*  Just not everybody's cup of tea. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4856.7s)]
*  I go back to, as a journalist, it's super interesting. [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4858.58s)]
*  And as a human being and a father, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4862.5s)]
*  the victims are entitled to as much justice [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4865.299999999999s)]
*  as they can be given. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4867.5s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4868.94s)]
*  And for me, I'm in a weird spot, [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4869.78s)]
*  because this has never really been my story. [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4871.74s)]
*  Unlike Dan and Cash, [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4874.62s)]
*  I actually haven't been out there for years, [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4876.58s)]
*  like pounding the Epstein thing. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4878.26s)]
*  I've reported on it when it's been news. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4879.82s)]
*  I've had certain newsmakers on to talk about it, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4882.54s)]
*  but it's never been my real thing. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4885.46s)]
*  But now I'm in this weird position of saying, [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4888.34s)]
*  hey, it's a thing, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4890.219999999999s)]
*  when they're like, no, it's not a thing. [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4891.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm like, well, what do you mean? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4892.34s)]
*  It is a thing. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4893.38s)]
*  Anyway, okay, let's move on. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4894.78s)]
*  I'm gonna take a break. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4896.74s)]
*  We're gonna come back, [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4897.58s)]
*  and I have got to talk to you. [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4898.42s)]
*  I'm gonna warn you, Mark Halpern, [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4900.66s)]
*  you didn't know this is coming. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4901.7s)]
*  I am going to talk to you about a former colleague of yours [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4903.82s)]
*  at ABC News, [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4906.54s)]
*  who I believe is the vainest man in television. [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4908.38s)]
*  And I'm going to show you my evidence on why. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4915.0199999999995s)]
*  Stand by for that. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4918.62s)]
*  I think. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4919.46s)]
*  Well, we'll find out. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4921.34s)]
*  I won't say it when we come back. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4922.46s)]
*  I'm gonna ask you who your prediction is, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4923.66s)]
*  and then I'll show you my evidence. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4925.62s)]
*  Stand by. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4926.82s)]
*  When your metabolism works properly, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4928.46s)]
*  you feel the benefits in so many aspects of life. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4931.02s)]
*  And that's why I want to tell you about Lumen. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4933.26s)]

*  scammers can steal home titles and your equity is the target. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=4995.86s)]
*  Here's how it works. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5000.26s)]
*  Criminals can forge your signature on one document, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5001.5s)]
*  use a fake notary stamp, pay a small fee with your county, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5004.1s)]
*  and just like that, [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5008.14s)]
*  your home title has been transferred out of your name. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5009.86s)]
*  Then they can take out loans using your equity, [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5012.86s)]
*  or even sell your property. [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5015.82s)]
*  So when's the last time you checked on your home title? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5017.78s)]
*  Your answer's probably never. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5021.0599999999995s)]

*  Okay, during the break, [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5055.34s)]
*  my team and I had in-depth discussions [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5056.46s)]
*  on what we're about to show you, [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5058.98s)]
*  and we all have very strong feelings on this next little bit. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5060.26s)]
*  So this segment is about vanity in media, Mark Alperin, [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5065.34s)]
*  and you worked for many years at ABC News [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5068.54s)]
*  as one of the top honchos over there. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5072.06s)]
*  The next person I think I am going to say [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5074.5s)]
*  is the most vain man at ABC News. [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5077.3s)]
*  All right, remember Johnny Carson in Karnak. [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5082.3s)]
*  You've got the hand up to the head, the card. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5085.18s)]
*  He's written it down. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5089.9s)]
*  Yes, DM. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5090.74s)]
*  He's got the proper initials, just like Debbie Murphy, [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5092.06s)]
*  Canadian Debbie, but it's not her. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5095.42s)]
*  She works for me. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5096.94s)]
*  It is David Muir. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5098.18s)]
*  We covered him a couple of months ago at another tragedy, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5100.299999999999s)]
*  and he was caught on camera [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5106.259999999999s)]
*  wearing his fake little fireman's jacket. [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5109.66s)]
*  This is him reporting or showing the video, [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5112.86s)]
*  and he made the mistake of turning to gesture [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5115.58s)]
*  to the scene behind him, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5118.58s)]
*  and you can see he's got like the clothes pins [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5119.54s)]
*  on the back of his fake little fireman's jacket. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5123.419999999999s)]
*  He's not a fireman. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5125.9s)]
*  Trying to make his waist look skinny. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5127.38s)]
*  Mark, what man makes his waist look skinny [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5131.06s)]
*  on television or elsewhere? [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5136.26s)]
*  That's strange. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5137.82s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5139.26s)]
*  Unless you're gay. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5140.18s)]
*  I need to accuse myself [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5141.42s)]
*  because I'm currently wearing safety pins to cinch. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5142.74s)]
*  So people like the cut of my jib. [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5146.900000000001s)]
*  I can't turn. [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5148.38s)]
*  If I did, you'd see. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5149.22s)]
*  I'm just lousy with safety pins in the back. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5150.34s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with being a gay man. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5152.9400000000005s)]
*  None whatsoever. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5154.3s)]
*  David Muir, I don't know what. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5155.22s)]
*  He's not married. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5156.42s)]
*  He's not out. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5157.38s)]
*  I'm not sure what's going on there, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5158.74s)]
*  but his vanity runs amuck. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5160.26s)]
*  He's not out? [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5161.74s)]
*  I thought he was out. [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5162.58s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5164.26s)]
*  He just gave a long interview that we read [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5165.1s)]
*  and laughed at in People Magazine [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5166.3s)]
*  where he was dancing around it, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5168.26s)]
*  but he doesn't, like he's dancing around [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5169.86s)]
*  like a partner or whatever, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5172.26s)]
*  but no, he's not out. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5173.18s)]
*  He's not out. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5174.38s)]
*  It's just suspicion. [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5175.22s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5176.9400000000005s)]
*  We've done some saluting, [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5178.22s)]
*  but in any event, gay or not gay, [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5180.26s)]
*  if you're an on-camera man, you need to be a man. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5182.62s)]
*  You need to be a manly man. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5186.900000000001s)]
*  You need to be in control [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5188.3s)]
*  and you need to not be worried [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5189.3s)]
*  about your waist circumference [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5190.780000000001s)]
*  or how tight you look around the middle [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5193.06s)]
*  when you're reporting from natural disasters. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5196.42s)]
*  So I would submit to the jury, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5199.860000000001s)]
*  while we do not have proof positive Mark Halpern, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5202.06s)]
*  we have circumstantial evidence that he's at it again, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5204.860000000001s)]
*  this time down in Texas, [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5208.620000000001s)]
*  reporting on the terrible flooding in Kerr County, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5210.900000000001s)]
*  outside of Dallas. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5213.860000000001s)]
*  He has, look at this, [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5215.62s)]
*  for the past two nights, [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5219.3s)]
*  two nights in a row, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5220.58s)]
*  is wearing his teeny tiny black t-shirt, [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5221.78s)]
*  super high cut on the biceps [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5226.66s)]
*  so you can see his muscles [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5228.94s)]
*  and the teeny tiny waist down below. [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5231.18s)]
*  And I will tell you something, [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5234.46s)]
*  look, this is when you zoom out a little bit, [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5237.18s)]
*  you can see the shirt has a little flare below the middle. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5239.74s)]
*  That's not how t-shirts work. [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5243.22s)]
*  Men's t-shirts do not cut in in the middle [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5245.06s)]
*  and then flare down below. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5248.18s)]
*  And we went and pulled the video [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5250.14s)]
*  of him doing his walk and talk [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5252.3s)]
*  because we really care about this. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5254.14s)]
*  And his t-shirt looks normal. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5256.9800000000005s)]
*  Look, it looks like a normal t-shirt Mark Halpern [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5259.3s)]
*  where he's in the field, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5262.14s)]
*  there's obviously no cinchers, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5263.02s)]
*  he's tucked it in in the back [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5264.22s)]
*  because I think he wants to show off his fanny. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5265.580000000001s)]
*  And he's walking, he's manly man in the field, [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5267.660000000001s)]
*  but then you get him on camera. [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5271.580000000001s)]
*  He's got the normal drape to it, [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5272.780000000001s)]
*  you get him on camera for the nightly broadcast [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5274.38s)]
*  and in goes the waist [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5276.5s)]
*  where it's smaller than Megyn Kelly's waist, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5278.22s)]
*  but in my defense, I've had three children, he hasn't. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5279.9800000000005s)]
*  And he wants the world to know [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5282.3s)]
*  he's super, super tiny in the waist, [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5284.1s)]
*  but super muscly in the arms. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5287.3s)]
*  And the reason this matters is because vanity [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5290.14s)]
*  is a muck in TV news in general. [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5294.46s)]
*  And amongst our evening news anchors, [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5297.14s)]
*  it already brought down Brian Williams, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5299.3s)]
*  his need to embellish his life, [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5301.82s)]
*  his reporting himself. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5304.46s)]
*  And I would submit to you that this is like that [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5306.82s)]
*  in a different form. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5310.099999999999s)]
*  Well, two things. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5312.139999999999s)]
*  One, I can clear up the t-shirt thing. [[01:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5312.98s)]
*  I've been chopping with him. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5315.38s)]
*  He wears a medium, but it's a ladies medium. [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5316.54s)]
*  So that explains why it's so tight. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5319.7s)]
*  I have a great story to tell you, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5322.3s)]
*  which is how I knew what the answer was, [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5323.58s)]
*  but I can't tell you here on the program, [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5325.0199999999995s)]
*  but next time I see you, I will tell you another story. [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5327.66s)]
*  Oh, that's so unfair to our viewers. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5330.98s)]
*  I know. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5332.9s)]
*  I'm not in a position to say it for wide consumption, [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5333.86s)]
*  but I will say it. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5336.46s)]
*  Well, let me ask you this about your story [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5337.299999999999s)]
*  without getting into the details. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5338.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5340.219999999999s)]
*  Do you feel it in a heartfelt, personal way [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5341.419999999999s)]
*  that he's the vainest person at ABC News? [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5343.86s)]
*  I feel this story illustrates the fact [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5346.78s)]
*  that if there's another contender for that award, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5348.82s)]
*  they're a distant second. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5351.7s)]
*  Oh, at ABC? [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5353.58s)]
*  Oh, if there is, they are a distant second. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5356.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5359.94s)]
*  But maybe not just at ABC, maybe in all of Manhattan. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5361.0599999999995s)]
*  We also, I used to go to the same gym as he did too, [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5364.139999999999s)]
*  so I've seen him in action. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5366.74s)]
*  So you go to the gym, but when I watch your show, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5368.98s)]
*  you do not seem to feel the need to show me [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5372.0599999999995s)]
*  the products of your gym visits. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5373.94s)]
*  I do not see the bolding. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5375.98s)]
*  I just don't turn sideways to show you, [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5377.62s)]
*  and I said I used to go to his gym. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5380.62s)]
*  I don't still go to his gym. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5384.0199999999995s)]
*  Okay, so here's the thing. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5385.42s)]
*  I still go to the gym, but Steve has me working very hard, [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5386.98s)]
*  so I can't spend three and a half hours at the gym. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5390.82s)]
*  This is how Steve shows up at work too, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5394.0199999999995s)]
*  and I constantly tell him, Steve, no one can see you. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5395.74s)]
*  You're not on camera, no, just kidding. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5397.7s)]
*  But I have worked with a lot, Steve is objecting, [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5399.78s)]
*  I've worked with a lot of men in television. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5403.0199999999995s)]
*  I worked for years next to Bill Hemmer. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5405.42s)]
*  I worked for years next to Bret Baer. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5407.7s)]
*  And of course, they care about how they look on camera, [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5409.98s)]
*  and there's an attention to looking neat [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5412.7s)]
*  and making sure the hair is not sticking out. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5415.42s)]
*  I have never seen this level of vanity amongst the men [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5418.62s)]
*  that I have had the pleasure of co-anchoring with [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5422.98s)]
*  or working next to. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5425.74s)]
*  I know some, I'm not gonna say who, [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5428.0599999999995s)]
*  but they do Botox, there's somebody at Fox I knew [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5429.179999999999s)]
*  who got a surgery, a man. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5432.379999999999s)]
*  I don't judge it, honestly. [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5435.259999999999s)]
*  Being on camera, you have to maintain things. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5436.379999999999s)]
*  But cinching the waist for a super skinny girl-like [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5440.379999999999s)]
*  svelte figure is weird, and it's a bridge too far. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5444.86s)]
*  This is where I draw the line, Mark Halperin. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5448.9s)]
*  Well, two things. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5451.5s)]
*  One is, the song from the producers, [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5452.339999999999s)]
*  if you got it, flaunt it. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5454.82s)]
*  So I think there's a certain element. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5456.54s)]
*  He doesn't wanna waste what God has given him [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5458.339999999999s)]
*  and what Peloton has buffed. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5459.98s)]
*  Steve the other day called me and said [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5463.9s)]
*  he had 200 clothespins, and he bought on Amazon [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5465.259999999999s)]
*  and wanted to know if I wanted 100 of them. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5470.62s)]
*  So you make of that what you will, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5472.5s)]
*  but some of us are cinching, [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5475.5s)]
*  we're just not dumb enough to turn sideways on camera. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5476.34s)]
*  Steve's very upset he's getting thrown under the bus [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5479.5s)]
*  and has no microphone, this is very wrong. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5482.0599999999995s)]
*  He should make his Amazon transactions private. [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5485.54s)]
*  Let me tell you something else. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5488.22s)]
*  Okay, here's further evidence. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5492.46s)]
*  Here's some context and some evidence. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5494.0199999999995s)]
*  We decided to take a look at the other anchors, [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5496.5s)]
*  but this is a national tragedy. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5498.46s)]
*  You know, I mean, I shouldn't have to point out [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5499.62s)]
*  you've got children who are dead. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5501.0199999999995s)]
*  Like seriously, who shows up thinking [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5502.62s)]
*  about the size of their waist [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5504.22s)]
*  and whether they look buff in the evening news shot. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5505.46s)]
*  It's very strange behavior. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5508.22s)]
*  So we took a look over at CNN. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5510.58s)]
*  They've got Pamela Brown down there on site. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5512.780000000001s)]
*  Let's see how she's dressed. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5514.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5516.900000000001s)]
*  Like a news anchor in the field [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5519.740000000001s)]
*  reporting on a tragic weather story. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5522.860000000001s)]
*  Like you dress if you were late [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5524.740000000001s)]
*  to pick your kids up at school [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5526.5s)]
*  and you had to rush to make them up. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5527.66s)]
*  Yeah, truly, she's not doing glam. [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5529.1s)]
*  And by the way, we all know that when we go on site, [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5531.62s)]
*  to report when people have died, glam is not a thing. [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5535.14s)]
*  You don't do glam. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5537.62s)]
*  If anything, you play it down. [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5538.780000000001s)]
*  Everybody knows that. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5539.780000000001s)]
*  Pam Brown, totally appropriate. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5541.780000000001s)]
*  Now, who's the next one before we get to NBC? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5543.54s)]
*  I think we have one other. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5547.14s)]
*  We have Maurice Dubois over at CBS now. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5549.58s)]
*  Looks totally normal. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5553.740000000001s)]
*  He's got- [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5554.820000000001s)]
*  Is he at CBS network? [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5555.66s)]
*  I think he's network now. [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5557.26s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5558.9800000000005s)]
*  Evening news now, who can keep track? [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5560.700000000001s)]
*  Nobody pays attention to this stuff anymore. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5562.94s)]
*  At this point, you and I are the only two people [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5564.54s)]
*  who have an anchored CBS evening news. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5567.5s)]
*  Everybody else has had their shot. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5569.94s)]
*  But Steve has done it. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5571.06s)]
*  Steve also did it. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5571.9s)]
*  Yeah, Steve's done it. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5572.74s)]
*  He's wearing a button-down- [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5574.58s)]
*  Alison's done it. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5575.82s)]
*  Alison's done it, everybody but Alison. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5576.82s)]
*  Alison, our booker. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5577.9800000000005s)]
*  She's being considered. [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5579.26s)]
*  He's wearing a button-down shirt, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5581.74s)]
*  like a man's shirt that you'd wear with a suit. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5583.34s)]
*  That's appropriate, no tie in the field, totally get it. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5586.06s)]
*  That's what you should do. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5588.18s)]
*  And it's the right size. [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5589.02s)]
*  If I worked at Nordstrom's, that's the size I'd give him. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5590.18s)]
*  That's right, and no cinching. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5593.14s)]
*  I'm not looking at his teeny tiny waist. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5594.34s)]
*  I'm not like, oh, Maurice lost weight. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5596.820000000001s)]
*  Look at him. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5598.66s)]
*  Or look at his big muscles, not that either. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5599.5s)]
*  Then we meander over to NBC News. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5601.66s)]
*  And this is interesting because- [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5605.14s)]
*  Tommy? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5605.9800000000005s)]
*  Is this Tommy? [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5606.820000000001s)]
*  Tommy Amis. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5607.820000000001s)]
*  Lamis, Tommy Lamis. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5609.22s)]
*  He looks totally appropriate. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5611.54s)]
*  He has same as Maurice. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5614.1s)]
*  He's got like a black men's shirt on with a button-down. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5615.34s)]
*  His collar is buttoned appropriately. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5618.98s)]
*  We're not looking at chest at all. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5621.179999999999s)]
*  He's not showing off muscles. [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5623.0599999999995s)]
*  And let me tell you something. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5624.78s)]
*  If he was wearing makeup, he sweated through it too. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5626.419999999999s)]
*  Yeah, no, he actually could use a little [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5629.0199999999995s)]
*  like pancake makeup tonight. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5630.78s)]
*  But he's a common for David Muir [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5632.74s)]
*  because even though Muir is crushing NBC right now, [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5637.139999999999s)]
*  just because people know NBC is bad, [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5640.58s)]
*  that they're evil in their hearts, [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5642.139999999999s)]
*  this guy, Tom Lamis, took over for Lester. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5644.219999999999s)]
*  And he's younger and he's likable [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5647.38s)]
*  and he's actually doing well. [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5649.74s)]
*  And he has like tripled the increases [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5650.9800000000005s)]
*  for the past two weeks he's been on [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5655.900000000001s)]
*  and he's coming in the demo. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5657.46s)]
*  Are his ratings higher than Lester's? [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5659.58s)]
*  Yes, yeah. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5662.34s)]
*  He's going up above Lester. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5663.54s)]
*  And he's improving the NBC demo number, [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5665.22s)]
*  which is the number they really care about. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5668.34s)]
*  They want you to look at like, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5669.62s)]
*  oh, we have 7 million a night, we have 7 million. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5670.46s)]
*  All anybody cares about is the key demo. [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5672.820000000001s)]
*  And in the key demo, he's making inroads [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5674.66s)]
*  against David Muir, who is like, tighter, tighter. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5677.860000000001s)]
*  I see this young man, he's coming for me. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5680.620000000001s)]
*  I'm pulling my stretch of pants right now. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5682.660000000001s)]
*  Super tight, Mark Halpern. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5684.5s)]
*  It's the clothespin girdle combo [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5686.18s)]
*  that gets you where I can put my fans around the waist. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5690.1s)]
*  Like Bart Simpson. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5695.18s)]
*  That's right. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5696.620000000001s)]
*  Homer around Bart's neck, right around David's waist. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5697.46s)]
*  And you gotta be able to do it and not touch him to circle. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5700.18s)]
*  He's five demo points away [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5703.1s)]
*  from calling in a Kardashian for a corset. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5704.78s)]
*  That's where this is going. [[01:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5707.58s)]
*  Just, you heard it here first. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5709.139999999999s)]
*  Tighter cinch. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5711.219999999999s)]
*  Runs amok. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5713.54s)]
*  Forget rewriting page two. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5714.98s)]
*  I just need to tighten the cinch. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5716.86s)]
*  I have to end on this story. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5718.82s)]
*  I didn't even know we were doing this segment. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5721.38s)]
*  I know, I surprised you. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5723.42s)]
*  Wait, how much time do I have, Steve? [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5724.86s)]
*  Steve's flummoxed. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5726.86s)]
*  Canceling his Amazon orders. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5729.5s)]
*  Okay, yeah, exactly. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5732.54s)]
*  And also your Venmos. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5734.0199999999995s)]
*  Did you know that your Venmos are public? [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5736.66s)]
*  I know other people's Venmos are public. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5739.0599999999995s)]
*  I know when I signed up for Venmo, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5740.82s)]
*  I toggled the box to not let everybody know [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5742.099999999999s)]
*  what I'm paying for lawn mowing or licorice. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5744.94s)]
*  It's very smart. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5748.339999999999s)]
*  I don't use Venmo. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5749.9s)]
*  I have Abigail Finan who does some Venmo-ing for me [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5751.0199999999995s)]
*  and some other service she uses. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5754.62s)]
*  But I didn't know that. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5756.419999999999s)]
*  And I think a lot of people get burned [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5758.0599999999995s)]
*  by the fact that Venmo is public. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5759.259999999999s)]
*  Well, the National Security, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5761.62s)]
*  the former National Security advisor had that problem. [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5763.26s)]
*  He did? [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5766.860000000001s)]
*  What's his name? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5768.02s)]
*  The guy who was fired. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5769.42s)]
*  Waltz? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5771.3s)]
*  Waltz. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5772.54s)]
*  Waltz had public Venmo [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5773.38s)]
*  and he had a bunch of transactions with reporters. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5774.54s)]
*  Oh God, oh God. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5777.34s)]
*  Oh, that's humiliating. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5778.58s)]
*  I don't remember that. [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5780.06s)]
*  I remember the Signal Gate, [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5781.02s)]
*  but I didn't remember the Venmo. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5782.18s)]
*  There's an accurate Signal Gate. [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5783.54s)]
*  Last but not least, [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5785.62s)]
*  because I really wanna get to this other story, [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5787.820000000001s)]
*  but I don't think we have time. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5789.06s)]
*  We don't have time for opera, do we? [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5790.5s)]
*  I'm dying, my audience is trying [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5791.7s)]
*  to get to opera. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5793.9800000000005s)]
*  Can you say five minutes late, Mark Halperin? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5794.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think. [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5796.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, I'm gonna get to that in a minute. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5799.860000000001s)]
*  But I'm gonna start with this. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5801.740000000001s)]
*  How about we reference at the top of the show [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5803.34s)]
*  the fact that the TSA is finally saying [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5805.02s)]
*  that we do not have to wear our shoes [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5807.54s)]
*  anymore on board airplanes? [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5810.660000000001s)]
*  You mean to go through TSA? [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5815.18s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5816.820000000001s)]
*  That we don't have to go, we don't have to take them off. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5817.860000000001s)]
*  We don't have to take them off to go through TSA. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5820.18s)]
*  I hate to sound like Kamala Harris, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5822.06s)]
*  but I've got pre-checked, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5823.22s)]
*  so I haven't taken off my shoes in a while. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5824.18s)]
*  The whole shoe thing was an outgrowth of the shoe bomber, [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5826.26s)]
*  whose name was like Richard... [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5829.06s)]
*  Reeve. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5831.26s)]
*  Something, Richard Reeve, is that his name? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5832.1s)]
*  Reeve or Reed? [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5832.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, Richard Reeve. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5834.38s)]
*  Richard Reeve. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5835.22s)]
*  Anyway, it seemed to me a huge overreaction. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5836.14s)]
*  One guy put it in his shoe, [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5839.26s)]
*  and so for then on, no liquids and no shoes. [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5841.26s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5845.900000000001s)]
*  I'm proud to live in a country [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5849.9800000000005s)]
*  where we can figure out how to check the shoes [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5852.06s)]
*  while they're on your feet, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5853.38s)]
*  as opposed to going through the metal, didn't they? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5854.66s)]
*  I was talking to Paul Murray about this on Sky News. [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5856.3s)]
*  Why not the belt? [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5858.58s)]
*  Why does the belt have to come off? [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5859.7s)]
*  What can you hide in the belt? [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5860.98s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5862.78s)]
*  I'm for safety, but I'm also for competence. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5864.9s)]
*  But these are lies. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5868.06s)]
*  These are lies. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5869.3s)]
*  When we were going through TSA, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5870.14s)]
*  my son had a five ounce toothpaste. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5871.1s)]
*  Not four, five. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5874.5s)]
*  Stole it. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5876.22s)]
*  They took it. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5877.06s)]
*  Confiscated, confiscated. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5877.9s)]
*  He can only be four. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5878.74s)]
*  I'm like, he's literally 11. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5879.58s)]
*  You think my 11 year old managed to get a bomb [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5880.98s)]
*  in his five ounce toothpaste, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5883.0199999999995s)]
*  which would have gotten Drew had it been four ounces? [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5884.179999999999s)]
*  What flavor was it? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5886.38s)]
*  It was like the travel flavor of the kids' toothpaste. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5887.42s)]
*  You know where it's got like- [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5891.82s)]
*  Like bubble gum? [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5892.66s)]
*  Yeah, like some sort of sugary addition to it, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5894.0599999999995s)]
*  which kind of defeats the purpose. [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5896.42s)]
*  Yeah, again, the country's not that advanced [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5898.219999999999s)]
*  to know that bombs in four, impossible. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5900.82s)]
*  Bombs in five, high security risk. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5904.179999999999s)]
*  And not only that, you can bring multiple fours. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5906.78s)]
*  So you could do four ounces of shampoo, [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5909.9s)]
*  four ounces of conditioner, four ounces of face wash, [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5911.78s)]
*  four ounces of toner, four ounces of lotion, [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5914.219999999999s)]
*  face cream, whatever. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5916.78s)]
*  So if you're a bomber, how can you make a bomb [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5918.339999999999s)]
*  out of a five ounce toothpaste tube, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5921.46s)]
*  but not out of the multiple four ounces [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5924.299999999999s)]
*  that Megyn Kelly has in her Ziploc bag? [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5926.04s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5928.179999999999s)]
*  I mean, the irrationality of the system [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5929.299999999999s)]
*  undermines our confidence. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5932.139999999999s)]
*  But I'm glad no one's gonna be taking their shoes off [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5933.86s)]
*  anymore, but I haven't taken my shoes off in a while. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5935.7s)]
*  Right, because you know what happens, Mark Halpern, [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5938.06s)]
*  is you then have to put your little sweater in a bin [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5940.34s)]
*  that somebody's disgusting shoes were just in [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5945.5s)]
*  that were walking all over the streets of New York. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5947.54s)]
*  Or you've gotta put your handbag [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5949.820000000001s)]
*  that you're about to put over your shoulder [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5951.1s)]
*  in that same bin that's got somebody's shoe filth [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5953.22s)]
*  all over it. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5956.1s)]
*  This is, it was unsanitary. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5956.9400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, but I'm being asked all the time [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5959.5s)]
*  to sit on couches of dogs that sat on too. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5960.9400000000005s)]
*  Well, look, we all know that the TSA security system, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5964.12s)]
*  while technically for our safety, [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5968.36s)]
*  is really about giving TSA agents the opportunity [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5970.4s)]
*  to exercise their little modicum of power [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5972.84s)]
*  in a disproportionately large way. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5975.84s)]
*  They get drunk on their own power, [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5978.48s)]
*  and then they abuse us by taking our toothpaste [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5980.2s)]
*  or our Johnson & Johnson's baby shampoo. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5983.4s)]
*  One of my kids had like a small acne medicine. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5986.28s)]
*  Oh, we're gonna blow up the plane with acne. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5989.16s)]
*  It's like a teenager. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5991.08s)]
*  What do you think we have it for? [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5992.1s)]
*  And they don't exercise discretion. [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5993.780000000001s)]
*  It's just, nope, we're taking it, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5996.34s)]
*  especially if it's a bottle of liquor. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=5998.8s)]
*  I'm just saying order must be restored, [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=6000.58s)]
*  and I believe Sean Duffy's gonna do it. [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=6003.18s)]
*  He's been pretty good. [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=6006.42s)]
*  Sean Duffy is bringing humanity to air travel. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TALB2vI5ZoU&t=6007.900000000001s)]
