Video Description: Megyn Kelly opens the show by discussing what's really happening with President Trump vs. Ukraine President Zelensky, and how the Ukraine War could end now that Trump's administration is leading negotiations. Then actor Zachary Levi joins to discuss his new movie, “The Unbreakable Boy,” why he feels God brought him and the rest of the movie cast and crew to this, the importance of the movie and its message, how it fits with the rest of his career, how Tulsi Gabbard helped lead him to support Trump during the campaign, his support of RFK Jr. at HHS and Elon Musk at DOGE, how his career wasn't affected by the endorsement of Trump, the inspiring way Robert F. Kennedy plans to transform the Department of Health and Human Services, his plan to address the "off limits" areas that have been ignored, how he moved to Austin, Texas in an attempt to solve his problems, why this actually led to more challenges, hitting rock bottom in his life when he blew his life up, how a combination of God and therapy saved his life, how he landed the lead role in “Shazam” while spending a month in intensive therapy, how it was God calling him to the role and the support he received along the way, and more.

# Zachary Levi on RFK and Tulsi Bringing Him to Trump, Secrets of Hollywood, & How God Saved His Life
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show, live today from SiriusXM HQ in New York City. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=0.0s)]
*  I have to say, when we show you the full set later, you'll see a SiriusXM really stepping up its game. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=6.8s)]
*  It got me like the NFL Sunday guest, like desk. It's, look at this. So fancy, isn't it? [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=12.96s)]
*  Thank you, friends at Sirius. I love it. And this seat will be occupied momentarily by Zach Levi, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=19.44s)]
*  who is here in the building and on his way up. And I'm looking forward to speaking with him. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=25.28s)]
*  There's a lot to go over today. And you know what? Before we get to that, picking up on our AM update, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=30.080000000000002s)]
*  I don't know if you guys listened to the AM update this morning. It was our first morning podcast. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=37.36s)]
*  So we're going to be offering that now during the weekdays. It's just a 15 minute straight news [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  update for folks before they start their day. But it was mostly about what's happening with [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  the settlement, the resolution of the Russia-Ukraine war and how Trump has really taken the lead. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=52.559999999999995s)]
*  Hello, somebody had to and is having direct meetings with Putin. And Zelensky of Ukraine [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=59.36s)]
*  is very unhappy and continues to sort of yap about it. Now, with all due respect to Mr. Zelensky, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=66.56s)]
*  this thing was just on and on and on with no progress until or hope of resolution until [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=74.0s)]
*  Trump got directly involved, till he got elected and stepped in there and actually started to say, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=79.92s)]
*  look, let's be realistic about how this thing is going to land. So Zelensky would do well to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=84.72s)]
*  just be quiet for a while to see what Trump can accomplish. And when Trump brings it to him, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=89.76s)]
*  it will be a proposal and he can react accordingly. But instead, he's been yapping [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=95.6s)]
*  the whole week long about there's no deal on Ukraine without Ukraine. Well, he knows that. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=101.36s)]
*  But realistically, you'll probably do what we tell you to because your war ends without our support. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=107.11999999999999s)]
*  And everybody knows that. So we're kind of doing you the courtesy of allowing you to appear like [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=111.67999999999999s)]
*  you are in charge. But everyone knows without our money, this thing goes away. You lose. You would [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=116.08s)]
*  have lost week one. The Europeans have donated some, have supported some. But let's be honest, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=122.08s)]
*  their coffers are a lot more shallow than ours are. And we're the number one player in making [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=129.35999999999999s)]
*  this thing go away. So that's why Trump is taking the lead. He's dealing with Putin directly. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=134.88s)]
*  And Zelensky just keeps dropping these not helpful statements. And I think Trump has about had it [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=140.24s)]
*  because he just issued a truth, a truth social. And I'll give you a couple. All right. So [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=146.88s)]
*  standby. Let me see if I can find these on my phone. Oh gosh. Can you guys send them to me [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=154.88s)]
*  again? My team sent them to me and now I can't find them now that we're actually live on the air. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=160.88s)]
*  Stand by. I will get it to you. Here it is. Oh no, shoot. That's not it. Are we live? Is [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=166.4s)]
*  this happening live? Trump basically called him a dictator and put him in his place saying, you know, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=172.56s)]
*  why don't you take a seat because we're doing something here and you're not being helpful. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=179.6s)]
*  Here it is. Think of it. He writes on truth social, a modestly successful comedian, [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=185.92s)]
*  Volodymyr Zelensky talked the United States of America into spending $350 billion to go into a [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=191.76s)]
*  war that could not be won, that never had to start, but a war that he without the U S and Trump will [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=198.56s)]
*  never be able to settle. The U S has spent $200 billion more than Europe and Europe's money is [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=205.6s)]
*  guaranteed while the U S will get nothing back. You remember that Trump struck the deal the other [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=211.44s)]
*  day or was starting to, uh, that would allow for us to have access to Ukraine's natural minerals [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=215.92s)]
*  as, you know, as collateral for our, for our money. And nobody even thought of that. You know, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=222.24s)]
*  Biden was just handing them boatloads of dollars without any promise in return. So Trump is saying [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=228.24s)]
*  here, um, that we spent $200 billion a year, got a guarantee. We never did. Why didn't sleepy Joe [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=234.48s)]
*  Biden demand equalization in that this war is far more important to Europe than it is for us. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=240.64s)]
*  We have a big, beautiful ocean as separation. Obviously Europe is part of Ukraine and Ukraine's [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=245.67999999999998s)]
*  part of Europe and Europe has to worry about this war, which is in its backyard, not ours. On top of [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=251.2s)]
*  this, Zelensky admits that half of the money we sent him is missing. That's exactly right. He [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=255.67999999999998s)]
*  admitted that it's gone under reported, but we've got over a hundred billion dollars. That's just [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=260.8s)]
*  kind of gone. And Zelensky is admitting it. And by the way, if you said, we don't trust him, he's, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=265.28s)]
*  we think this man should not be entrusted with the American dollars. You would be called all sorts of [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=271.28s)]
*  names as recently as like six months ago, but it's a valid concern. He's admitted that it's gone and [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=276.32s)]
*  no one knows where, uh, he says, Zelensky refuses to have elections is very low in Ukrainian polls. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=281.91999999999996s)]
*  And the only thing he was good at playing Biden, the only thing he was good at was playing Biden [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=288.96s)]
*  like a fiddle, a dictator without elections. Zelensky better move fast or he is not going to [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=292.8s)]
*  have a country left. In the meantime, we are successfully negotiating an end to the war with [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=297.44s)]
*  Russia. Something I'll admit only Trump and the Trump administration can do. Biden never tried. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=301.36s)]
*  Europe has failed to bring peace and Zelensky probably wants to keep the gravy train growing. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=307.68s)]
*  Going. I love Ukraine, but Zelensky has done a terrible job. His country is shattered and [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=312.40000000000003s)]
*  millions have unnecessarily died. And so it continues. And let me tell you why this is so [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=318.4s)]
*  bad for Zelensky. It's because recently, um, Trump, as since he took office was sounding not neo-conny [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=323.12s)]
*  Trump is not neo-conny, you know, JD Vance and Tucker are much more in the non-interventionist [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=331.91999999999996s)]
*  camp. And that's very large within the Republican party. I would say Trump is close to them, but not [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=336.96s)]
*  entirely aligned with them. He's still got like a toe over in not neo-con camp, but you know, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=342.8s)]
*  he's not afraid to drop a bomb on a guy like Soleimani. He's, you know, if the situation calls [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=349.04s)]
*  for it, Trump will be more bellicose, both in his language and then ultimately in his behavior. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=354.32s)]
*  And what Zelensky doesn't want to do is is saber rattle Trump, um, over to the JD Vance Tucker side [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=359.12s)]
*  where Ukraine will get even less than Trump is trying to negotiate for them. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=369.28s)]
*  Right. Trust me, when I tell you, uh, they'll do better under Trump in a good mood than they will [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=374.08s)]
*  under Trump in a screw you Zelensky mood. So this is not smart behavior, uh, from a guy who has very [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=379.68s)]
*  few chips with which to bargain. Trump, uh, spoke to what's happening between the U S Russia and [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=386.88s)]
*  Ukraine from Mar-a-Laga on Tuesday. Here's stop five. Tell us a little bit more about, um, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=392.72s)]
*  the Russia talks, uh, your impression of how they went today and if you're perhaps more confident [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=398.64000000000004s)]
*  or less confident of a deal after what happened today. Well, much more confident. They were very [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=403.04s)]
*  good. Uh, Russia wants to do something. They want to stop the savage barbarianism. I mean, what, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=407.68s)]
*  what's going on over there? It's soldiers are being killed by the thousands on a weekly basis. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=415.44000000000005s)]
*  It's ridiculous. And they're not American soldiers. They're Russian soldiers and the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=421.36s)]
*  Ukrainian soldiers largely, although a lot of Koreans have been killed. As you know, uh, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=426.16s)]
*  quite a bit of them have been killed. They came over to fight and a large portion have been wiped [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=432.0s)]
*  out. Uh, but we want to, we want to end it. It was, it's a senseless war. It should have never [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=436.48s)]
*  happened, would have never happened if I was president. Well, that's the other piece of it. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=441.84000000000003s)]
*  I think we all know that's true. He has a different relationship with Vladimir Putin [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=446.88s)]
*  and Putin would have been more, if not afraid of Trump than respectful, I think of the power [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=451.84s)]
*  that Trump yields as the United States president. Uh, Trump went on to say, yeah, I can end this war. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=458.96s)]
*  And honestly, everyone knows that. So he really like, again, Zelensky's playing with fire. Take [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=466.71999999999997s)]
*  a listen here to SOT6. I want to see peace. Look, you know why I want, because I don't want all these [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=471.52s)]
*  people killed anymore. I'm looking at people that are being killed and they're Russian and Ukrainian [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=477.68s)]
*  people, but they're people. It doesn't matter where they're from on the whole planet. And I think I [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=483.44s)]
*  have the power to end this war. And I think it's going very well. So that's where things stand. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=489.12s)]
*  Now, look, if he strikes a deal with Putin that, uh, allows Putin to have some most, it's going to [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=496.56s)]
*  probably going to be most of the territory that they have taken in Ukraine, but also says, uh, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=504.72s)]
*  and, and also says that Ukraine will not be joining NATO. Putin will accept that deal and [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=510.64s)]
*  Zelensky is going to accept that deal. He's going to have to have security to ensure that they will [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=516.88s)]
*  not be attacked again. And it seems like the Europeans are prepared to give them some forces. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=522.4s)]
*  Trump is saying no U S forces. We're not going to be the peacekeeper over there. Great. I think [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=527.84s)]
*  we've all had it up to here with that kind of role for the United States across the world. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=532.0799999999999s)]
*  And I'm sure there will be some sort of additional financial investment, which Trump will now say [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=536.72s)]
*  will be repaid in essence by, um, the earth materials, the raw earth materials that we can [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=542.0s)]
*  get out of Ukraine, which is very valuable. So that's where we are. Um, it's a precarious [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=546.96s)]
*  situation, but it's going to be handled. And the only thing that could clear the deal is [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=552.48s)]
*  Zelensky shooting his mouth off. Let's hope he stops that. Um, okay. So today we've got a very [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=556.88s)]
*  special guest. His name is Zachary Levi. You may have seen him on this broadcast. You may have seen [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=563.12s)]
*  him on some other shows around the cable nets and so on. Um, he's a big Hollywood actor. He's Shazam. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=567.52s)]
*  That's how my kids know him. I know him from the Kurt Warner movie in which he was amazing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=574.0s)]
*  And he did something especially courageous, uh, especially for those in Hollywood this year. And [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=579.28s)]
*  that was, he came out as an open supporter of Donald Trump and of RFKJ during the primary. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=585.36s)]
*  All right. So first it was our KJ and then he endorsed Trump, despite the inevitable backlash. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=591.84s)]
*  Everyone knew it would come, but there's something interesting happening with him. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=596.48s)]
*  I don't know that it has come. It's like somehow I think we might've found the one [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=601.28s)]
*  Hollywood celebrity who wasn't an open Republican who endorsed Trump and still has a career. It's [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=605.6800000000001s)]
*  one of the mysteries of life. Uh, we discussed the last time, uh, why he discussed, why he felt the [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=611.6s)]
*  need to speak out and his support of the so-called Trump Avengers team, you know, Tulsi, RFKJ and so [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=617.2s)]
*  on. Uh, when he was first on the show back in October, it was episode nine to eight. We didn't [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=622.64s)]
*  have time to go through his fascinating life and career, so we get to do that today with him [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=627.84s)]
*  in studio. But first here's a quick refresher, uh, on Zach on screen. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=632.64s)]
*  I hope I'm not interrupting. No, not at all. That's from, that's from Batman. Cause that makes it [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=642.5600000000001s)]
*  better. Hi. How you doing? The name's Flynn Rider. How's your day going? Huh? [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=650.08s)]
*  Who else knows my location? Flynn Rider. All right, Blondie. Rapunzel. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=662.08s)]
*  Gazant. The only person I know that knows anything about this Kate Crusader stuff. Can I? Oh yeah. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=667.76s)]
*  That's crazy, right? What are your superpowers? Superpowers? Dude, I don't even know how to pee [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=674.96s)]
*  in this thing. Amazing. That's the last one from Shazam. He's got a new movie out in theaters this [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=678.96s)]
*  Friday and it's called the Unbreakable Boy. It is a heartwarming story about the ups and downs [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=686.48s)]
*  of navigating life with an autistic son. And we'll get to that in just a bit. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=691.6800000000001s)]

*  narratives, especially when it comes to president Trump. It's safe to say you can expect more agenda [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=709.12s)]
*  driven stories and factual distortions all over the rest of the news. But I do want to tell you [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=714.08s)]
*  about ground news. Unlike other platforms that censor or amplify certain narratives, ground news [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=718.96s)]
*  is not a news publisher. They're an independent app and website that aggregates every source on a [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=725.04s)]
*  story so you can compare coverage and see through mainstream media spin. Ground news has an entire [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=730.56s)]
*  blind spot feed with stories that are receiving lopsided coverage. It truly reveals how media [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=737.04s)]
*  narratives are shaping the conversation. My viewers are going to get 40% off their vantage plan, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=742.0s)]
*  which gives you unlimited access to their website and their app. They are independent. They are [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=746.9599999999999s)]

*  Zach, welcome back. Hi. So good to be back. So good to see you in person. I know. Not just in a little [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=764.4s)]
*  square on a screen. I know. You never get to do it in person. I love coming down to the series XM [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=768.88s)]
*  fishbowl and you know, they broke out the NFL desk for us. How about that? Oh, look at this. This is fancy. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=772.88s)]
*  It's the football desk. They don't do this for just anybody. I want you to know that. I'm honored. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=777.6800000000001s)]
*  So I want to kick it off with your movie because I think this is perfectly on brand for you. I think [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=782.16s)]
*  the Kurt Warner thing was perfectly on brand for you. Of course, Shazam just has mass appeal. That's [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=787.4399999999999s)]
*  on brand for anybody. But like this is great because it's a story about love, family, challenges, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=791.76s)]
*  faith. And I think given your new found, like huge fans on the right who appreciate not just how you [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=798.0799999999999s)]
*  act, but what you stand for, this is right in the sweet spot. Yeah. I mean, listen, my goal is always [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=804.64s)]
*  to just make excellence. Like from the beginning of my career, even as someone who grew up Christian [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=810.8s)]
*  and was conservative in many ways, I would consider myself a libertarian, but I've always had [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=818.56s)]
*  conservative fans and Christian fans. And I've always said, I have no intention of being a [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=823.3599999999999s)]
*  Christian actor. I want to be an actor who also happens to be a Christian or who happens to be [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=827.5999999999999s)]
*  whatever else those other kind of indicators are. But with this, with The Unbreakable Boy, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=833.76s)]
*  with American Underdog, I went after those films. It's the Kurt Warner film. Yes, the Kurt Warner [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=840.16s)]
*  film. Those films resonated with me because they were excellent. I could see it on the page. They [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=844.56s)]
*  were excellently written and the team around them wanted to make them excellently. And I love this [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=849.68s)]
*  story particularly, similar to the Kurt Warner film, American Underdog. It's a true story. It's a real [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=855.36s)]
*  family and their story. And Scott Lorette, who I play the father and husband, he wrote a book, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=860.64s)]
*  The Unbreakable Boy, which this film is based on. And he was very brave and very vulnerable in [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=867.2s)]
*  showing just how not great of a father and husband he was for many years. He felt like he was failing. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  He was. Because the child has a couple of disabilities or challenges. And no parent [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=876.96s)]
*  understands how to handle that naturally. And so he's very open about how it wasn't easy. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=883.76s)]
*  No. And more than that, he and his wife, Teresa, they got pregnant on the third date. That was a [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=888.4000000000001s)]
*  massive curveball. It's like, wow, this is not what I was expecting. But they were like, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=895.2s)]
*  we're going to see this through. We're going to do this and we'll figure out our relationship as we [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=898.5600000000001s)]
*  go. That was hard. That was a curveball. Simultaneously during all of this, now they're [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=902.24s)]
*  having children and their first son, as you pointed out, has multiple things going on that [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=908.24s)]
*  he's struggling with. One is osteogenesis imperfecta, which is brittle bones disease. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=912.88s)]
*  They find out early on within the first couple of years, that's crazy and a massive curveball, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=917.92s)]
*  not what he's expecting. And then a few years later, he's presenting very atypically and they [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=922.48s)]
*  find out he's on the autistic spectrum. I think that all of these things are indicative of, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=926.48s)]
*  even if those aren't specifically the things that we go through or struggle with in our own lives, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=934.72s)]
*  we all have these expectations of what we think our life is supposed to be, how it's supposed to [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=939.76s)]
*  look, how it's supposed to unfold. Scott was already dealing with his own insecurities and [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=942.96s)]
*  unhealed traumas, not really accepting and loving himself. So these things then just pile on. We [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=948.88s)]
*  feel like, well, clearly I'm screwing up if all of these things, if this is where the universe or [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=954.96s)]
*  God is bringing my way, this is my karma. This is what's happening to me. And I was really grateful [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=959.52s)]
*  that I got to portray him and really bring it to life in a very authentic way. It's not just [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=965.84s)]
*  rainbows and butterflies and feel good, this movie. This movie has lots of that in it and humor and [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=970.0s)]
*  heart and it's infused with faith, but it allows the audience to go into the grittiness and [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=974.72s)]
*  darkness and hardship that the human condition brings about, what it means to just be human [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=982.72s)]
*  and then tackling marriage and parenthood and all of those things. So- [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=989.0400000000001s)]
*  Let's show them a clip so they get a flavor for what we're talking about. Let's watch [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=994.0s)]
*  Side 18, part of the trailer. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=997.28s)]
*  This is Tyler. He said we can be best friends. All I have to do is shut up. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1027.28s)]
*  Oh yeah, I'm also autistic. Autism presents itself in many different ways. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1032.6399999999999s)]
*  It's a class for kids with special needs. They think that it's time that it's only gonna get worse. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1038.24s)]
*  Earth to Austin. I think his brain's on another planet. Nope, my brain is right here in my head on Earth. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1043.44s)]
*  This is not what I thought it was gonna be like. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  Choose one. Dad's late for work. Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa. Austin, what are you doing? [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1053.04s)]
*  I feel like I'm failing every day and the harder I try, the worse I do. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1057.52s)]
*  Honey, your mistakes don't define you. How you healed us. [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1061.44s)]
*  You've given up so much for this family and you have never stopped fighting for us. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1066.1599999999999s)]
*  Patricia Heaton as the grandmother. I'll watch anything with her. Her values are so intact. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1072.48s)]
*  She's so great. She is so solid as a human being and she's so talented. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1077.84s)]
*  Megan, what's Megan's last name? Megan Fahey. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1083.6s)]
*  She's amazing. She's like a rising star. She's a rising star. White Lotus. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1085.28s)]
*  White Lotus season two. The thing with Nicole Kidman. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1088.56s)]
*  The thing with Nicole Kidman. Yeah, I don't remember the name of these shows. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1091.76s)]
*  I don't remember either, but she was great in that too. The perfect couple. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1093.84s)]
*  Yeah, she's very talented and we were very grateful to have her play Teresa. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1096.56s)]
*  Drew Powell plays my basically best friend in the movie, Peter Faccinelli, [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  plays our pastor. And the child actor, Jacob. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1107.28s)]
*  Jacob Laval. Yeah, who's here. He's based in New York. He's a wonderful kid, young man now. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1110.0s)]
*  I mean, he's crazy talented. Yeah, very talented and so uniquely [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1115.04s)]
*  perfect for this role because you're trying to bring a child with autism to life in the most [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1119.6799999999998s)]
*  authentic way possible. And also we were casting in the height of the pandemic. There were a lot [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1126.3999999999999s)]
*  of people that were just like, I don't want to leave my home. I don't want to chance it. The [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1131.4399999999998s)]
*  plague is flying around the world. So everyone that ended up playing these roles was someone [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1135.2s)]
*  that was tailor made and fit perfectly. Like, you know, God works this way. I mean, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1140.48s)]
*  those were the people that were supposed to be in this film with the cast, the crew. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1145.3600000000001s)]
*  And it was a little engine that could. It was a thing that kind of came out of nowhere as we [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1150.64s)]
*  were preparing to make American Underdog. This was like an added bonus. And then we shot that, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1154.0s)]
*  shot American Underdog. And then we were supposed to, originally the movie was supposed to come out [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1159.2s)]
*  three years ago. But because it was a small slice of life family film and because a lot of people [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1163.36s)]
*  were still hesitant getting back to theaters, even in, you know, beginning of 2022, Lionsgate, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1169.6799999999998s)]
*  and I think wisely said, listen, we don't want this thing to get lost. We don't want to get [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1176.08s)]
*  destroyed by these tent pole movies are the only ones doing well. So let's sit on it. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1179.9199999999998s)]
*  And three years later, here we are. So, I mean, I'm sensing a theme in the projects to which you are [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1185.04s)]
*  attracted. I mean, I think anybody would have taken the lead in Shazam, any actor, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1191.12s)]
*  and Holly would have killed for that. But it also has an uplifting message. I mean, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1194.4799999999998s)]
*  part of what we loved about it was just how sweet it is, the relationship amongst the family. And [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1197.52s)]
*  also it made you laugh. Like I was trying to explain it to my friend. I'm like, it's not like, [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1202.4799999999998s)]
*  he's not like a scary superhero. He's funny. He's goofy. You know, you're totally rooting for him. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1206.4799999999998s)]
*  But then like the Kurt Warner American Underdog, that story is amazing. It's one of the best [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  American stories. I think I mentioned this to you last time you were on, but my first husband was [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1216.32s)]
*  obsessed with the LA Rams and they've moved around anyway. But he was obsessed with Kurt [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1220.48s)]
*  Warner and was reading that autobiography or biography camera. I think it was his autobiography [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1226.0s)]
*  on our honeymoon. So I got to know all these facts about Kurt Warner. First, I was like, [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1230.4s)]
*  this is so boring. Stop reading me football excerpts. And by the end, I was like, I'm reading [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1234.08s)]
*  that book right now. You know, who marries a single mother with a child who's challenged and [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1238.16s)]
*  has all sorts of challenging disabilities. No man who's like on his way up in the football world, [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1245.84s)]
*  you would think would say, yeah, this is where I want to park the car. I want in on this situation. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1251.76s)]
*  But Kurt Warner did. He was backbencher. He only got to play because the first stringer got hurt [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1257.4399999999998s)]
*  and everybody was like, oh, bullshit. Kurt Warner's were in this sucks. And sure enough, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1263.1999999999998s)]
*  it was just such a great story, right? An MVP of the football game. So I'm just sensing a theme in [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1268.8s)]
*  the stories that you select that they all have heartstrings and they have these classic American [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1273.2s)]
*  stories. I mean, I think heart is the most important ingredient in almost any story told, [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1277.52s)]
*  whether that's a comedy or a drama or a dramedy, or even if you're watching an action movie or, [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1283.68s)]
*  you know, sci fi or whatever. Like, are you the audience able to connect to that character? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1290.4s)]
*  The first and most important thing you're connecting through is the humanity in that [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1296.32s)]
*  character, which is the heart of that character. I've been very blessed that, you know, a lot of [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1300.24s)]
*  these roles, they come to me, you know, up until Shazam. I couldn't be very picky about the jobs [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1305.2s)]
*  that were coming my way. Now, post Shazam, I have more offers. And so I have a little more agency [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1310.48s)]
*  and deciding, okay, we'll go this way. We'll go that way. But up to Shazam, I could, I had say over [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1315.52s)]
*  the auditions, I would go on or not, but those jobs are still like, okay, what's what, what is [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1322.08s)]
*  God going to put in my lap? What role am I about to go and play? And I will say that, you know, [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1327.44s)]
*  maybe it's because I lead with my heart. My whole life I have, I have a really deep empathy and love [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1333.28s)]
*  for all of humanity. And I, and I, and I really mean that it's not just a, you know, a sound bite [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1338.3200000000002s)]
*  or whatever. I just, I, it's one of the reasons why I felt so compelled to even begin speaking, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1344.72s)]
*  I guess, you know, being more open politically, because I felt like not just where I think we [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1350.0s)]
*  needed to go, but guys, we're tearing each other apart. We're, we're not seeing the person across [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1355.44s)]
*  the table as a child of God. We're seeing them as the enemy. We're seeing them as a monster. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1361.28s)]
*  And I just don't operate that way. I want to be able to go and bring people together as best I can. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1366.0800000000002s)]
*  And as an actor, when I get to tell stories that are so led, heart led, that get to tell stories [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1371.44s)]
*  that are infused with hope and, and that are inspiring, that, you know, that, that bring [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1377.92s)]
*  people back to understanding themselves and each other more. I think that, you know, that's a, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1383.36s)]
*  those are great opportunities. Is it also fun to go and do things that have nothing to do with that, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1388.4799999999998s)]
*  that are just for fun, just for laughs? Absolutely. I want to do all that stuff too. But as an actor, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1393.4399999999998s)]
*  I want to, I mean, to me, like, I'm proud of almost everything that I've done in my career. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1401.84s)]
*  Almost everything. Interesting qualifier there. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1406.32s)]
*  Well, I'm proud of everything that I've done. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1408.4799999999998s)]
*  I see ground to exploit. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1410.0s)]
*  On different levels, right? On different levels. But what I'm saying is I am particularly proud of [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1411.04s)]
*  this film in part because I got to play a role that, that really goes through it. It's not just one [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1417.2s)]
*  level of being, all right, I'm this guy. And not to say that other roles that I've played haven't [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1424.08s)]
*  also had levels and layers, but there's an overall kind of more upbeat, let's say vibe to Chuck that [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  I did on NBC for years or Shazam or Tangled or Harold and the Purple Crayon or whatever, you know, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1436.8s)]
*  I have so much love for all these projects in one way, shape and form, but to play this real [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1442.08s)]
*  character, similar with American Underdog, you know, Kurt was much more stoic. And so there was, [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1447.6s)]
*  there wasn't quite the same roller coaster, like, as Kurt was also just this really like solid dude, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1454.1599999999999s)]
*  as you're talking about, like he wasn't struggling with alcohol. He was struggling with his own, [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1460.0s)]
*  like, what am I doing? I'm lost in this journey and I feel like God called me to be the next Joe [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1464.48s)]
*  Montana, but that's not happening. And I'm stocking shelves, but I love this woman and she's got two [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1468.88s)]
*  kids and I love them too. And so I'm going to go commit to that and we'll see where God takes me [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1473.68s)]
*  the rest of the way. Scott is wrestling with God the entire time, putting on a good face, yeah, yeah, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1477.92s)]
*  charming this guy, you know, working, but also just losing himself in a bottle because he's drinking [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1484.24s)]
*  away his problems because that's what so many people struggle with. I mean, alcoholism is rampant. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1489.1200000000001s)]
*  Let me show them a little bit of that. We have a bit of that captured in Clip 20. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1493.6s)]
*  This has never been me. I'm never content. I've never have been. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1524.24s)]
*  I used to think that that made me ambitious, but actually it just makes me ungrateful. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1530.48s)]
*  And I hate that about myself. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1542.1599999999999s)]
*  I push everything away, everything and everyone I care about. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1544.56s)]
*  I don't want to do that anymore. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1554.1599999999999s)]
*  I want to be more like my son. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1564.9599999999998s)]
*  And that's him there in a group therapy for alcoholism. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1566.8s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. Sorry. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1570.3999999999999s)]
*  No, it's emotional. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1574.72s)]
*  Yeah, it is. And I haven't really, I've only seen the movie once. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1575.76s)]
*  Really? [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1579.28s)]
*  Yeah. We did it, when John finished it, we had a screening, just like kind of our cast and it was [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1580.32s)]
*  wonderful. It was great to finally see what we had made together. And I think that's the [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1587.12s)]
*  thing that I have struggled with, that I think we all struggle with on some level. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1592.16s)]
*  Gratitude is massive. It's so absolutely integral to the health and wellbeing of ourselves and those [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1597.04s)]
*  around us to practice gratitude. There's so many amazing studies that have been done, by the way, [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1604.6399999999999s)]
*  like not just, I think, but I think that it's so important to practice gratitude. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1609.76s)]
*  I think that's the thing that I've been struggling with. I think that's the thing that I've been [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1614.96s)]
*  doing. There's so many amazing studies that have been done, by the way, like not just when we [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1618.56s)]
*  practice gratitude, when we see other people, in fact, I think they've shown it's even more [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1621.92s)]
*  powerful if you watch other people be grateful to other people. Like if you're just a fly on the [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1627.1200000000001s)]
*  wall and you watch some person help an old lady across the street with her groceries, that in and [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1631.2s)]
*  of itself, and you see that old lady grateful to that person, it changes you inside. It's incredible. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1635.84s)]
*  Right? [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1642.72s)]
*  There's quite a line that he has there that you've delivered of, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1643.04s)]
*  I used to think it made me ambitious. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1646.8799999999999s)]
*  Ambitious, yeah. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1648.48s)]
*  And then I realized I was just ungrateful. Wow. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1649.52s)]
*  Yeah. And that, when I read the script and when I was, I mean, that was me, that was me tapping [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1652.32s)]
*  into a lot of my own issues with that because obviously we all want to go do well in this world [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1657.44s)]
*  and we want to be ambitious and you want to be successful. There's nothing wrong with any of [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1663.2s)]
*  those things. But if you're not looking at what's right in front of you, right in front of you, [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1667.36s)]
*  right in that moment and being present with that and being grateful for that and because of that, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1671.28s)]
*  because he was struggling and feeling like he's failing. Well, when you feel like you're failing, [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1679.44s)]
*  it's very difficult to be grateful for what you've got in front of you because you feel like none of [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1682.6399999999999s)]
*  it is good. And so he was- [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1686.0s)]
*  They make you write the lists. Now, people like keep a gratitude journal where you must write down [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1688.16s)]
*  three things a day is the ideal that you're grateful for. It's just, it's the whole exercise [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1692.56s)]
*  of it. But I think it's interesting that you're feeling emotional as you're discussing this, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1696.96s)]
*  because when I read your bio and read up on you in advance of today, the last time we didn't do [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1701.76s)]
*  that, I just thought you were an interesting actor who was getting kind of political and that was [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1707.28s)]
*  interesting. But you, you're interesting. You've had quite a background and I'm now having gotten [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1710.96s)]
*  to know you a little bit better. It's no mystery at all to me why you've chosen the projects that [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1717.52s)]
*  you've chosen or why you're doing so well with them or why you feel emotional now discussing it, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1723.04s)]
*  because you have had your own lifetime of struggles and it's probably what drove you into acting [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1728.1599999999999s)]
*  for many reasons. And it's what led to your initial frustration in choosing a profession, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1735.44s)]
*  which is overloaded with rejection, right? Before you made it. And I'm sure there's still some of [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1740.72s)]
*  it now, but the whole journey makes a lot more sense to me. I mean, yeah, there's no coincidences, [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1745.92s)]
*  God's using all things. And I really do feel though, at a very young age, four, three or four [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1753.28s)]
*  years old, I knew that I was going to be an actor. Really? I knew it. I knew it in my knowing. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1759.44s)]
*  I can't explain it. It's like the closest thing I can paint as a picture is imagine [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1764.0s)]
*  when we're with God at source in heaven, whatever that other place is, imagine like there's some kind [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1772.48s)]
*  of mission select screen that we're looking at, like an options of what is the life that my soul [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1780.96s)]
*  is going to go live or something. And as a part of that, there's like stipulations like, okay, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1785.92s)]
*  you go choose this path. And part of that path is you're going to be an actor. And that's going to [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1790.4s)]
*  be a part of the journey that you're going to be on. And I also felt very called from very, very [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1794.48s)]
*  young age to be a leader and to love people and to like affect positive change in this world and [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1799.1200000000001s)]
*  build community. Like I felt these things in me. I couldn't articulate them in words that would [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1805.2s)]
*  probably make any sense because I didn't have a vocabulary at that time. But the knowing in [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1810.24s)]
*  my knowing and my soul and my purpose and my calling, like I felt these things. And so [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1815.68s)]
*  I think that was helped along certainly by being the middle boy between two girls in a house that [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1820.88s)]
*  was full of a lot of trauma and me just trying to find an identity and a voice in all of it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1825.68s)]
*  Also, very early on, knowing people, knowing like feeling, you know, having a deep empathy for people, [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1830.72s)]
*  feeling them and how they reacted to things. I knew that a smiling, laughing person felt good [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1838.56s)]
*  on the inside. You know, like I was tuning into that very young and I was like, oh, okay, wait a [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1844.8s)]
*  minute. Well, I know how to make people smile and laugh. I do a little joke. I do a little dance. I [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1848.24s)]
*  do a little funny impersonation or whatever. And I can evoke these responses and making people feel [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1853.6s)]
*  good was like, oh my God, that's the drug I've been addicted to my whole life. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1859.36s)]
*  Right. So, you know, I read this is I think from your book about you're talking about how in your, [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1862.1599999999999s)]
*  with your mom and the glass of water, can you tell that story about how you just picture a glass of [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1866.8s)]
*  water condensing on the countertop? Yeah. So my mom, God rest her soul, was a really a wonderful, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1872.16s)]
*  dynamic, beautiful, intelligent, like wickedly intelligent human being who also dealt with tons [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1881.04s)]
*  of unhealed trauma. And that led her down a road that I think brought upon probably like borderline [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1887.3600000000001s)]
*  personality with narcissistic tendencies. And that's a very difficult burden for people to [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1895.12s)]
*  handle. This might sound strange, but like I actually have a lot of empathy for narcissists. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1900.1599999999999s)]
*  They're some of the most destructive people in the world. That's because they're some of the most [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1904.6399999999999s)]
*  destroyed people down inside of themselves. But my mom, as a borderline personality, specifically, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1908.0s)]
*  her moods were always what ruled the moment. So if my mom was in a good mood and I did something [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1915.1999999999998s)]
*  wrong, I broke a glass, something that was sitting on the counter and I accidentally knocked it over, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1922.08s)]
*  shattered. If she's in a good mood and she's rocking out and she's listening like Bon Jovi [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1926.3999999999999s)]
*  or Journey or the stuff that she would be in a good mood, she'd be like, oh man. And she'd, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1930.56s)]
*  okay, what happened? But it would be okay. Unfortunately, mom was not in that mood more [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1935.4399999999998s)]
*  often than not. And it got worse and worse through her alcoholism and through a lot of other just [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1940.32s)]
*  unhealed trauma. And so you knocked that same glass off of the counter and it is, how dare you, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1943.9199999999998s)]
*  you little shit. The fangs and the claws and everything would come out because that's what [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1949.6s)]
*  she learned from her mom. And that's what she learned from somebody, her mom or dad, this [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1954.1599999999999s)]
*  generational trauma. And so- You kind of learned, you said that you believed, if I could just be [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1958.48s)]
*  better, if I could just be a more perfect boy, then I can please her. Yeah, kind of. But it wasn't, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1965.6s)]
*  I don't think it ever felt like if I could be more perfect, it was more just like you start to learn, [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1972.0s)]
*  okay, this is my reality. How do I navigate it? And my mom and stepdad both had kind of impossible, [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1976.4s)]
*  my biological father, who's also passed away and I love him, but we didn't really have a lot of a [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1985.44s)]
*  relationship. I grew up with my mom and my stepdad, both of them heavily traumatized people. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1990.88s)]
*  My stepdad was super traumatized in the ways of having thresholds that were like impossible to [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=1996.0800000000002s)]
*  hit, like a bar that you could never, never really get to. Very, very, very high standards. And so [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2000.96s)]
*  that became this mission of how do I navigate that while simultaneously navigating a target [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2005.84s)]
*  that's constantly moving. It's one thing to have- Very destabilizing. Yeah. You can have a bar, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2012.8s)]
*  like if both parents had this impossible bar, you know, okay, well, it's just, then it's like [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2017.76s)]
*  perfection, perfection. You got to get up there, you got to go do that thing. But with my mom, [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2021.36s)]
*  there'd be these moments of really beautiful love and grace with the thing. It's like, it's okay, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2024.8s)]
*  don't worry about it. And there's where the target is. You're like, okay, I think I'm safe. I guess [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2029.12s)]
*  I'm okay. And then the next day it'd be like, I can't, and you're like, whoa, whoa, the whiplash [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2033.36s)]
*  of it all. So then, you know, as a child, you just start to literally, you know, teach yourself or [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2037.28s)]
*  learn ways to navigate that minefield. And it's a difficult minefield. Certainly there was the [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2042.9599999999998s)]
*  perfectionism on the other side of things and me, that all kind of became conflated in and of itself. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2047.76s)]
*  It was gnarly. It was a gnarly experience. But I will say none of that, and many people deal [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2053.68s)]
*  with very similar experiences. None of that makes me a victim. None of that makes me absolved from my [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2059.28s)]
*  stupid behavior that comes out of my trauma. We are all responsible for healing our trauma [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2066.5600000000004s)]
*  and responsible for the actions that come out of that. I think the problem starts getting into [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2071.44s)]
*  where we start throwing blame and shame and guilt on people. It's like, you should know better. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2076.1600000000003s)]
*  Well, I think it's interesting just as an explanation of your life's choices and of how [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2080.48s)]
*  difficult it must have been for you in the earlier, leaner years of being an actor, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2085.36s)]
*  because that you chose a profession that is also destabilizing, not predictable, full of rejection, [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2091.92s)]
*  and difficult personalities, and probably a fair amount of mental illness, let's be honest. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2100.08s)]
*  Oh yeah, rampant. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2104.56s)]
*  That's very interesting. You know how they say you marry the best and worst qualities of your [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2105.76s)]
*  parents? It's like kind of what you did in your job choice. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2110.24s)]
*  100%. But again, like I said, I don't think anything's wasted on God. I think that's all [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2112.8799999999997s)]
*  kind of part of it. Our job in all of it is to make sure that we become aware of that, aware of what [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2117.52s)]
*  we need to work on in ourselves, but know that God's still going to use your trauma and redeem [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2122.8799999999997s)]
*  that. I learned so much by growing up in my home with my mom and my stepfather. I got tools that [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2127.2799999999997s)]
*  people who grew up in really loving homes may never ever have. So I see the silver lining in [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2134.56s)]
*  that, which is again, doesn't excuse any of that, but he goes, okay, all right, what was God doing [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2140.64s)]
*  in all of that? Why did I choose to go and have this experience in this household if my mission [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2144.08s)]
*  in life or my calling was to go and be this actor? Well, shocker, all of that led me to [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2150.88s)]
*  better understanding, again, in the midst of a lot of it before I went through the healing that I did, [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2156.32s)]
*  I got knocked around by Hollywood. Even now, there are things that can be destructive, but I [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2161.84s)]
*  have worked on myself so much that I can see those who are the traumatizers in my industry and be [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2168.96s)]
*  like, oh man, they're just lost. They're lost in that. And I want better for them, but simultaneously, [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2174.08s)]
*  I'm not going to sit around waiting for my industry to become somehow saved. I've been very [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2179.52s)]
*  actively trying to build an independent movie studio, living community for people in my industry [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2185.28s)]
*  to be able to go create art and content and entertainment that is not being scrambled and [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2191.84s)]
*  infused with nonsense agenda. Just make great entertainment for the masses of all the way it [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2198.7200000000003s)]
*  used to be. And also simultaneously, if I'm going to go build a studio to go do that and accomplish [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2205.6800000000003s)]
*  that mission, well, let's go build a living community into it all so we can give people [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2211.76s)]
*  better lives because we all deserve that too. And I think that there are people- [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2215.76s)]
*  You have to get out of California. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2219.36s)]
*  Well, I did. I went to Austin. Yeah. I'm in Austin, Texas. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2220.56s)]
*  Well, that's an interesting pivot point in your life when you moved to Austin because [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2223.2799999999997s)]
*  your career was going well. You had starred in two series. You'd done multiple projects. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2226.7999999999997s)]
*  You moved to Austin, which everybody loves. We were just talking with another guest who [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2231.2s)]
*  moved to Austin, loved it. But it didn't start off that way. When you got down there, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2234.64s)]
*  that was your crisis point where you really thought about ending it all despite the fact [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2240.96s)]
*  that you'd already starred in TV series on prime time television. Like many actors, [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2245.76s)]
*  I think you found it wasn't the Holy Grail. It wasn't going to fill up everything. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2250.88s)]
*  And you got very, very low. So you mentioned this last time we were together. We didn't have a lot [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2255.36s)]
*  of time to talk about it. But can you just talk about how that hit you and how you then got out [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2259.5200000000004s)]
*  of that? Because that was before Shazam. Yeah, it was right before Shazam. Yeah. So I mean, [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2265.1200000000003s)]
*  the bottom line is I was, like most people, doing what a therapist once told me, a lot of hit and [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2272.48s)]
*  run. Meaning you're not the one doing the hitting, but you are the one doing the running. So you get [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2282.88s)]
*  hit with trauma. And trauma, there's a spectrum of trauma, right? So I know a lot of people like to [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2288.0s)]
*  throw it around like, oh, I've been traumatized. And they're not or whatever. But PTSD in war, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2294.48s)]
*  PTSD kind of stuff is one end of a spectrum of very intense trauma. There's traumas all the way [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2300.32s)]
*  across the board. Mental health is like dental health. You can have a little cavity. You can [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2305.6800000000003s)]
*  need a full blown root canal. It's all the same type of thing. No, no, no. There's a now famous [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2310.1600000000003s)]
*  clip of JD Vance and me in 2017 when I did this long profile in him on NBC. It's on YouTube. You [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2314.56s)]
*  can Google it. Everybody's seen it at this point. But where we kick off the interview by me ticking [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2321.6800000000003s)]
*  down raised in a house with domestic abuse, check. Raised in a house with alcoholism, check. Raised [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2326.88s)]
*  in a house with divorce, check. And these are all childhood trauma, CTEs, childhood trauma experiences. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2334.2400000000002s)]
*  And he had all of them. So you're absolutely right. Trauma, maybe one of those could be mild [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2340.4s)]
*  for somebody, could be severe for another. But a bunch of them in the same family leads to kind of [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2347.04s)]
*  massive trauma that must be dealt with at some point. It must. And unfortunately, most of us [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2351.92s)]
*  are completely unaware that we're carrying this around. We have no idea. Most people are in this [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2358.2400000000002s)]
*  world. They're just surviving. Right? And we're doing these hit and runs. Things are hitting us. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2362.48s)]
*  And we're just like, all right, I got to pick myself up and I got to run. I got to keep going [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2365.92s)]
*  because there's not enough time to sit and wallow in this. There's not enough time. I have to go [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2369.2000000000003s)]
*  work. I got to put on the table. I mean, whatever these reasons are, you keep moving forward. And [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2373.2000000000003s)]
*  there's also a resilience in that. And I think there's something beautiful about the human [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2377.36s)]
*  condition in that we can persevere and we can do these things. But suffice to say, I was heavily [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2381.52s)]
*  traumatized from childhood through my industry, through my own stupid choices, bad relationships, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2386.96s)]
*  a very short lived marriage that was unhealthy that I was an unhealthy person going into to begin with. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2395.76s)]
*  My mom had died in 2015 and we were, I hadn't spoken, really had a relationship with her in [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2403.68s)]
*  13 years at the time she did die. And she died tragically, like alone on a bathroom floor from [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2408.72s)]
*  complications of pneumonia. Like there's all these things that just, and you don't realize how [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2415.52s)]
*  psychologically damaging they can be or emotionally damaging they can be. And I was just trying to [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2420.3199999999997s)]
*  keep going, right? Put on that face, be actor guy, go do conventions. I love fans. I love [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2425.9199999999996s)]
*  spending time with everybody. I'm just going to keep doing what I do, completely unaware of just [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2431.2799999999997s)]
*  how broken inside that I was and that I did not have much more gas in my tank. And I, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2436.72s)]
*  with a head full of steam and dreams, after many, many, many years of knowing that I was supposed [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2443.12s)]
*  to go and buy land somewhere like Austin and go build this new Hollywood and save the world and [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2448.0s)]
*  all of the things that I feel like God's put on my heart, that was the driver. That was the last [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2453.4399999999996s)]
*  bit of fuel that I had left in me. And it drove me all the way to Austin and I bought my 75 acres. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2458.7999999999997s)]
*  And I was like, all right, God, I thought in my hubris, I'm like two years top. So I'm going to [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2463.76s)]
*  build this whole city and all this stuff. That was not the plan. And, but also, but also, so I ended [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2469.36s)]
*  up there and everything. I was like, what have I done? I've blown up my life. I'm here alone, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2477.44s)]
*  living in an Airstream on this land that's 30 minutes outside of Austin. Like it was gnarly. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2484.88s)]
*  And by the way, and simultaneously, I thought, and this was a big factor, I think it's worth [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2491.2s)]
*  mentioning. I thought, you know what? I'm also like physically, I got to clean up my body. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2495.9199999999996s)]
*  I stopped drinking. I stopped smoking. I was a pack a day smoker for like 15 years. Like, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2499.52s)]
*  and that's a lot. Really? Yeah. And I had also had a, an Adderall prescription because I have dealt [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2503.8399999999997s)]
*  with ADHD and stuff literally my whole life. I was grateful that my mom never put me on anything [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2510.64s)]
*  when I was a child, because I think it's important to allow a kid to not have to have that type of [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2515.52s)]
*  thing. However, I did find it to help me. The problem was that Adderall, I was depending on [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2519.52s)]
*  too much and cigarettes and not realizing that really what was down at the bottom of it, that's [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2526.72s)]
*  a dopaminergic dependency. Your dopamine system literally has been hijacked and you need to keep [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2531.12s)]
*  getting dopamine in you just to keep moving forward in life. And I thought in my infinite wisdom, [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2537.36s)]
*  I'm going to cut all this out cold turkey. Oh boy. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2542.72s)]
*  Holy crap. Combining all that unhealed trauma and all that unhappiness and then literally pulling [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2546.9599999999996s)]
*  the rug out from my dopamine system and having no dopamine whatsoever. I fell into the darkest, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2553.52s)]
*  darkest, deepest hole that I had ever really been in. And I was like, God, I don't want to [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2559.3599999999997s)]
*  live anymore. I don't know what to do. I don't even feel like you're real. I don't know where [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2565.7599999999998s)]
*  you are. I don't know why you've led me here to die in this darkness. And thank God I had the [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2569.84s)]
*  family and friends and support around me that I needed to just prop me up enough to then go to [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2575.28s)]
*  this three weeks of super intensive life-saving therapy, not too far in Connecticut. And it saved [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2580.56s)]
*  my life. It really did. And the part of what was life saving about that wasn't just all of this, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2586.7200000000003s)]
*  let's say clinical information that I was getting with lots of different therapists of different [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2593.84s)]
*  backgrounds and ilk. There was this woman, there were women who worked at this place who were [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2597.44s)]
*  companions. They were like these house moms. This place was set up for CEOs that were like- [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2604.2400000000002s)]
*  Do you say where you went? Oh yeah. Is it Silver Hill? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2610.0s)]
*  No, no, no, no. It's called Privé Suisse. Sounds fancy. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2613.12s)]
*  It does sound fancy. And by the way, and it's expensive. And that's part of why when I came [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2618.8s)]
*  out of there- They all are. Frankly, they all are. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2623.2000000000003s)]
*  But we should change that. Yeah, totally. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2626.08s)]
*  Which is what my mission is now, is trying to democratize at the very least, mental wellness, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2628.0s)]
*  mental health services and things so we can get people. If we can get everybody right in their [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2635.12s)]
*  own heart and mind, they start loving themselves, taking care of themselves, taking care of others. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2639.76s)]
*  I had a loved one go into one of these facilities for over a month and it was completely life [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2643.84s)]
*  changing. But it was exorbitant. It was extremely expensive. It was like $80,000. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2649.76s)]
*  And truly, no one can afford that. Nobody can afford that unless they have an extraordinary job. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2656.96s)]
*  And there's no insurance. There's nothing. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2661.2000000000003s)]
*  Sure. But we are a rare amount of people. And again, that's why I say thank God I had [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2663.1200000000003s)]
*  done well enough in my career where I could afford something that was so costly. But there was one [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2668.4s)]
*  woman there who of all of these house moms, and they would rotate through and they would basically [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2672.7200000000003s)]
*  take care of you because you were so despondent. They couldn't depend on you to even drive yourself [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2679.28s)]
*  to your own appointments. So they would have these women who were wonderful, that were either wives [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2684.0s)]
*  or mothers or both that were semi-retired, who had big hearts and that wanted to help these people [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2689.44s)]
*  get through their treatment. And this woman, she prayed for me every day, even though she wasn't [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2694.1600000000003s)]
*  even supposed to. She would pray for me. Wasn't supposed to. [[00:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2699.1200000000003s)]
*  Well, yeah. In the book, I talk about it in the book, but basically, [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2703.36s)]
*  and I understand, by the way, they've also made amendments to their programming because of this [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2708.0s)]
*  and because of the success of it. And I'm very grateful to those folks at Pray Base Swiss for [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2713.68s)]
*  having seen the efficacy of it. But what they wanted to make sure was that nobody was getting [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2716.8799999999997s)]
*  conflicting or contradicting therapy or advice. And sometimes you can go to a therapist that's [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2721.3599999999997s)]
*  giving you non-spiritual, just purely clinical advice, but you might have somebody over here in [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2727.2799999999997s)]
*  a spiritual sense being like, well, I don't know about that. Let's pray through it or let's do [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2732.24s)]
*  whatever. And unfortunately, I do think a lot of people who are spiritual people, Christian people, [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2735.68s)]
*  they still have this weird, like, I don't know about going to therapy because all the answers [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2740.0s)]
*  I need are in the Bible. I just pray away all of my issues. I don't think that's how that works. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2744.96s)]
*  Having gone through it myself, I definitely don't think that's how that works. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2749.44s)]
*  No, I went to therapy for years. I had such a great guy. I haven't seen him in a while, [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2751.8399999999997s)]
*  but I love him. And he gave me so many useful tools to deal with stress or anything, sadness, [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2755.9199999999996s)]
*  conflict. It's just about widening your arsenal. That's what it's about. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2764.64s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely. And they can be very complimentary, as they should be, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2768.8799999999997s)]
*  your spirituality and the spiritual wisdoms that are even found in the Bible that are, I think, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2772.72s)]
*  very much backed up by even a lot of what we're finding in science and clinical science and [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2778.08s)]
*  whatnot. So because of that, they didn't want anything contradicting itself. So there was kind [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2781.2799999999997s)]
*  of a rule like, hey, don't get too personal into these types of ways. But this woman saw my heart, [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2785.68s)]
*  she saw who I was, and she is just one of the most wonderful human beings that I've ever met [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2792.24s)]
*  in my entire life, also a mother. And she prayed for me, and she prayed me and loved me back to [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2797.7599999999998s)]
*  life, literally. There was a day that we were driving to one of my, I just got out of one of [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2804.4799999999996s)]
*  my appointments and I was just distraught because I felt like I'm getting nowhere. Nothing is [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2811.9199999999996s)]
*  happening. I'm still in this darkness. I still feel like, what's the point in living? And [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2815.9199999999996s)]
*  she was praying for me and she said, hey, just know that right now, technically I'm not supposed [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2822.4799999999996s)]
*  to do this. So if you said anything, I could potentially lose my job. And I said, oh my God, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2830.16s)]
*  I would never say anything. Please don't stop praying for me. You're one of the only things [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2837.12s)]
*  that's still keeping me alive. And I always get emotional at this point. She goes, oh no, of course, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2840.16s)]
*  of course. And then we drive for a moment longer. And then she turns back to me, she says, but also [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2845.3599999999997s)]
*  know that I would gladly lose my job for you. Oh, as a kid who didn't realize that the biggest [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2851.04s)]
*  thing that I was struggling through was not loving myself. And the reason why I wasn't loving myself [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2858.72s)]
*  was because I had never really gotten that from my parents as much as I know they loved me. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2862.24s)]
*  They were struggling so deeply that they weren't able to model that or show that to me and my [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2866.72s)]
*  sisters, I think in the way that they needed to. And so the thing that I struggled with the most [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2870.88s)]
*  in my life was that I didn't think I was even worthy of that love. And this complete stranger [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2874.88s)]
*  to love me and legitimately love me. It wasn't like, we all tell people, I tell people all the [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2880.7200000000003s)]
*  time, I love you, strangers. And I mean it. I mean it in the way that I believe God calls us to love [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2886.56s)]
*  as deeply as to love our enemy and pray for our persecutor, things we talked about last time. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2892.64s)]
*  But this woman, she was built to be a mom loving energy in that moment, absolutely for me. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2896.16s)]
*  Like if no other, like, oh my God, like legitimately I consider her to be. And so [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2907.76s)]
*  all of that, that's all that came out of me moving to Austin and all of this stuff. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2914.88s)]
*  And then the irony or not irony, but the kind of amazing way that God works was I was still in this [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2919.28s)]
*  therapy. I was like a week and a half in or two and a half, two and a half, two and a half weeks [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2924.88s)]
*  into my three week course essentially. And I had told my team and in Hollywood, my agents and [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2931.28s)]
*  managers, I was like, guys, I am not good. I am going off grid for three weeks to a month. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2935.28s)]
*  Like, you know, so if anything comes around, just we're, we're putting, you know, [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2940.32s)]
*  hitting pause and like, awesome, got it. Cool, cool, cool. Two and a half weeks in. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2944.1600000000003s)]
*  Oh, and sorry. And quickly, prior to me going to this place, two months prior, I had been offered [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2950.8s)]
*  the opportunity to audition for the role of Shazam and you declined it. I declined it because I was [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2955.92s)]
*  like, they're not going to cast me. I'm not, I'm not John Cena. I'm not the rock. I don't know why [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2960.4s)]
*  they're coming after somebody like me. So I was like, thanks, but no, thanks. And I passed again, [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2964.08s)]
*  not knowing that I was in a really low place of self-esteem and not believing in myself or whatever. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2968.48s)]
*  So now two and a half weeks into therapy, I get this email from my agent or somebody's like, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2972.7999999999997s)]
*  I don't want to bother you. Don't want to bother you. But there's another role. There's a supporting [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2977.36s)]
*  role, very small, like one scene read if you're feeling up to it, but no pressure. Oh yeah. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2980.88s)]
*  Okay. So that's a great place to leave this conversation on the back end. We'll pick it up. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2986.88s)]
*  That's a tease as we call it in the news biz. We'll take a break more on that story and on [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=2992.16s)]

*  daily exposure to processed foods, work stress, fluoride in water and environmental toxins can [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3005.28s)]
*  overwhelm the digestive system. The body faces constant attacks, but there's a way to fight back. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3010.56s)]

*  left off, we were in Austin, no, we were in Connecticut. We were in the therapy place and [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3068.4s)]
*  you're doing well. You're two and a half weeks into it. You'd already rejected Shazam only because, [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3074.4s)]
*  not because you were too big for Shazam. Well, the audition for, not an offer for. Yeah, because you [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3078.48s)]
*  didn't think you were going to get it. You thought this was kind of like a chain jerk. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3082.7200000000003s)]
*  So now they come to you two and a half weeks into this Connecticut facility. Exactly. And they, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3086.0s)]
*  it's a supporting role. It's one scene. And that day, I just happened to, it was Wednesday, [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3091.52s)]
*  and I just happened to have had the first breakthrough moment where I could see some [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3097.6s)]
*  light at the end of the tunnel. And I see this, this message, I'm like, this is so silly. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3101.28s)]
*  Like I'm supposed to be here and doing this healing, but I do believe that that was all [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3107.36s)]
*  meant to be. My agent was supposed to send that because I see this and I'm like, I'm starting to [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3112.0s)]
*  feel a little bit better about myself. I'm confident enough to maybe put myself on tape for this thing. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3117.0400000000004s)]
*  I go, when did they need this buy? And he says, by Friday. So I give myself a couple more days [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3120.96s)]
*  just to see like, am I starting to stand back up again? Am I starting to feel myself again? And I [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3125.52s)]
*  was, I was feeling stronger. And so I said, you know what? Screw it. Whatever. I went to the gym. [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3131.12s)]
*  I came back from the gym. It was in my room. I propped my phone up on the dresser, whatever, [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3137.52s)]
*  with a book, you know? This is crazy. And I did one take and I sent one take of this other role. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3143.04s)]
*  And hours later, my phone's blowing up and my agent's like, dude, not only did they love your [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3148.24s)]
*  read, but they also think you might be right for Shazam, which they have not cast yet. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3152.64s)]
*  And I'm in therapy finishing up wrapping up this therapy. I'm like, what is happening right now? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3157.92s)]
*  And so then I had to explain like, they were like, you got to get on a plane. You got to [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3162.6400000000003s)]
*  come back to LA. I was like, I'm not getting on a plane and coming back to LA. I still have [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3165.36s)]
*  a week of like the follow-up, like homework, like all of this stuff. Like I'd done the [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3168.88s)]
*  bulk of the therapy I needed to do, but there was still- [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3174.0s)]
*  They do give you tools to sail away with. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3175.92s)]
*  Yes. And I was already picking up these tools along the way, but still it's like, [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3177.28s)]
*  you wanted to have that last week of like saying your goodbyes and getting the last bits. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3180.2400000000002s)]
*  I'm like, dude, I can't. In fact, part of the reason why I'm here is because of that industry. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3184.24s)]
*  I can't just go do that. And he's like, okay, I get it. Let me go talk to Warner Brothers. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3188.3199999999997s)]
*  And he comes back and he says, okay, would you do a camera test? But like we can do it [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3194.0s)]
*  through basically iPads, through Skype. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3201.12s)]
*  What? [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3203.2s)]
*  So from therapy on Monday, then I had a conversation with the director of the weekend. [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3203.8399999999997s)]
*  I explained the situation. I was like, I can't put myself on tape reading these scenes. I can't do [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3208.16s)]
*  with my psychiatrist. Who's going to read off of me? Yes, with Beth. Beth actually probably [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3213.52s)]
*  could have done it. But again, you want, and I'm like, I don't know. So we decided we're going to [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3221.2s)]
*  do this Skype video camera test through the iPads. I did that on Monday. Monday evening rolls around, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3224.3199999999997s)]
*  phone's blowing up. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3230.72s)]
*  What? [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3231.68s)]
*  Dude, it's between you and another guy. If you don't come, he's going to get it. If you do come, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3232.3199999999997s)]
*  there's a really good chance that you might get this role. And I went downstairs. It was Monday [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3236.16s)]
*  evening. I went downstairs and there was Beth. Beth in the book. That's her name in the book. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3240.56s)]
*  Yeah. She's the one who prayed for you. [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3244.48s)]
*  Yes. And Beth happened to be working that evening shift. And I go, Beth, I don't know what to do [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3245.68s)]
*  here because I can't tell if this is God. Like this is the fruit of having done the work that [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3251.68s)]
*  I needed to do and God calling me into this. Or if this is the darkness. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3258.24s)]
*  Is it the devil? I know it could be. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3262.56s)]
*  Come back to Hollywood, Zach. We've got a prime role for you. You know, like whatever. I'm like, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3264.4s)]
*  what is happening? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3268.88s)]
*  Is this a big decision? [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3269.92s)]
*  It is. It's huge. And so I go downstairs and I go, I don't know what to do. And she's like, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3270.88s)]
*  let's pray about it. So we prayed about it. And we both came out of that prayer and we looked at [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3274.88s)]
*  each other. And we're like, I think I'm supposed to do this. And not because it was this amazing [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3279.2000000000003s)]
*  feel good, oh, go doosh, it was actually because we felt peace. It was just peace. [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3286.6400000000003s)]
*  And I think that's what we're all looking for all the time. That's where we know we're on the right [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3292.48s)]
*  path. If you're on a path that is surrounding you in peace, that's a real good side that God [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3295.92s)]
*  is like, I'm right there with you. Which is not to say that God is not with us when we're not [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3302.48s)]
*  feeling peace. Cause sometimes that's very much the situation that we're in. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3307.84s)]
*  Sometimes you need to feel unsettled as a cube that you're not on the right path. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3310.8s)]
*  Exactly. Exactly. Your spidey sense is going on. But in this case, it was all about that piece. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3314.08s)]
*  And so I call my agent and also I went to the Heidi who ran the organization. I was like, hey, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3318.16s)]
*  I need you to go to all of my therapists, of which they were myriad. And I need you to make [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3326.2400000000002s)]
*  sure that they all sign off that I'm good enough and healthy enough to go and do this. Because if [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3330.32s)]
*  any of them says no, then I need to listen to that and do whatever I need to do to make sure. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3334.56s)]
*  And she went to everybody and they all said, you know, check he's good. You can go. And so I flew [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3339.6800000000003s)]
*  to LA. I camera tested on Wednesday, Thursday was off. And then Friday I got a phone call and I was [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3344.7200000000003s)]
*  Shazam. Do you remember which scene they made you do? It was three scenes. It was one where I saved [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3352.4s)]
*  Mary. She's like walking across the street absentmindedly and a snowplow almost hits her [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3358.08s)]
*  and kills her. And I go save her as, you know, as grown up Billy Shazam. Another one was the one [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3362.0s)]
*  between me and Freddie that you saw in the clip of me. I don't even ought to pee in this thing. And [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3367.52s)]
*  then I can't remember what the third one was, but you know, they were, they were, they were very much [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3371.04s)]
*  the scenes that were in the movie. And so set the stage for us. And nobody listening, virtually [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3376.1600000000003s)]
*  nobody has done, has auditioned to star in a Hollywood movie, much less a, you know, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3380.48s)]
*  superhero movie. Is it what size is the room? How many people are in there? You're walking in, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3386.16s)]
*  you've just come out of therapy from this intensive program. You land like, is it an [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3390.56s)]
*  intimidating setting or what? How is it? Well, fortunately with film camera testing and things [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3394.88s)]
*  like that, it's not normally a big, like, you know, peanut gallery of people. You've got the director, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3399.44s)]
*  you've got, you know, the, whoever's operating the camera. You might have some other technicians, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3404.4s)]
*  the casting director. It's not a whole- Who's more important in that setting, the director or the [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3409.04s)]
*  casting director? No, the director for sure. Yeah. Because, but the casting director, if they're [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3413.52s)]
*  doing their job well, they're bringing in all of these options for the director to see. But at the [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3417.04s)]
*  end of the day, it's the director's choice. And then obviously the executives getting to watch [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3420.56s)]
*  whatever that camera test is, because that's why they're filming it. So they can go show the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3425.12s)]
*  executives and get approval there too. Ironically with network television, although it's, I don't [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3428.16s)]
*  know what it is now, but when I was coming up in television, which was the beginning of my career, [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3433.68s)]
*  1998 through, you know, 2012 really, that was way more difficult because with network television, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3437.84s)]
*  in order to get a role on a show or whatever, you got to go through all, you got to go audition [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3444.0800000000004s)]
*  for the casting director, then the producers, then you go to the studio executives and they're [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3448.48s)]
*  a literally like you're packed into a room. There's 20 executives sitting in their arms [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3452.8s)]
*  crossed being like, all right, monkey, make me laugh. You know? Oh yeah. And then if you pass [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3457.28s)]
*  that, you go to the network and the network is all the network executives and some of the studio [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3461.36s)]
*  executives and the producers and the casting directors. And you're just like, oh my God. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3465.12s)]
*  And people- [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3469.44s)]
*  That's horrifying. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3469.8399999999997s)]
*  It is. It is horrifying. It is a traumatic experience. I think a lot of it now is done [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3470.88s)]
*  by like people put themselves on tape themselves and they send those in. But you know, it was [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3475.44s)]
*  fascinating because there were a lot of people who would just crack under the pressure, great [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3480.48s)]
*  actors that would have been great on set, but they couldn't do that because it's gnarly. And [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3483.3599999999997s)]
*  then there were some people that were really good at doing a network test, but you get them onto a [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3487.7599999999998s)]

*  So you do it. And then how soon thereafter did they tell you you got it? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3534.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, it was so from the time I did the first audition for the other role to the time I was [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3538.08s)]
*  Shazam was one week. [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3542.7200000000003s)]

*  It was one week. My whole life changed in one week, not just because of, but very much because [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3544.4s)]
*  the therapy that I went and did the work. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3551.2s)]
*  I'm getting an instant return on your investment. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3553.52s)]
*  Megan, let me tell you what, like God is no God. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3556.24s)]
*  When you really commit to doing something in your life, and this has happened multiple [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3562.08s)]
*  times over my life. I might be struggling with something, something I'm screwing around [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3566.0s)]
*  with cigarettes, booze, girls, whatever it is. And I'm like, I, these are distracting me [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3568.96s)]
*  from my purpose in my goal. God does not wait for you to prove it to him after. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3573.44s)]
*  Well, let's see. Let's see if you hold on to this for six months, because God knows [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3579.28s)]
*  when you mean it. So if you in that moment be like, I mean this, I'm not going to go [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3582.7200000000003s)]
*  pick that up. God's like, oh, okay. Yeah, you do mean it. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3587.2000000000003s)]
*  I got you. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3589.84s)]
*  And so here come those blessings. Because at the end of the day, I think that God absolutely [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3590.32s)]
*  has tremendous amounts of gifts and blessings that he wants to bestow upon us. It's not that [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3594.32s)]
*  God is like holding it back because, oh, you know, God's, I don't believe in this God, [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3599.28s)]
*  the taskmaster, you know, naughty and nice list and whatever all that nonsense is, and, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3604.4s)]
*  you know, holding all of this against us. God's love for us is immense. And God is looking at us [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3609.52s)]
*  like we would look at our children who are like, give me the bigger toy. And it's like, [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3614.0s)]
*  well, you can't even hold the little toy. So if you show me, you can hold the little toy. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  And, you know, if you, if you can show me, you can pick up that five pound dumbbell, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3622.88s)]
*  then I'll give you a 10 and then I can give you a 20 and then I can give you 50. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3625.92s)]
*  It is like the way we look at our children with the most generous lens and very quick to forgive. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3629.36s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. And as soon as our child shows that they're responsible enough to level [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3634.08s)]
*  up to whatever this new, cool thing would be, driving a car, whatever it is, we want to be able [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3638.24s)]
*  to say, yes, oh my God, by the way, we're stoked because we see the responsibility growing in them [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3643.92s)]
*  that they are maturing, that we are maturing. I think when God looks at us and sees us wanting [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3648.7999999999997s)]
*  to mature, God's like, oh, praise, yes, because look at all of these other things that I wanted [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3653.12s)]
*  to give you. But I've had to, I couldn't because he would, they would crush you. You know, I think [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3658.24s)]
*  that every gift and every blessing comes with power, literally the money we're given, the [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3663.04s)]
*  resources we're given, the relationships that we're given, the careers that we're given, [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3668.0s)]
*  all of that comes with power. Gifting blessing comes with power. And if we've learned nothing [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3671.7599999999998s)]
*  else from Spider-Man is with great power comes great responsibility. And it's true. If you want [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3675.2s)]
*  those gifts, then you have to be ready for the power that comes with the responsibility. [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3680.32s)]
*  So what, what year is this? Like what point in time is this? So now you've gotten cast and you're [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3683.6s)]
*  going to start shooting. Shazam, that was, that was October of 2017. So I had just moved to Austin. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3688.08s)]
*  I had just had a breakdown. I just went to therapy. And then this, by the way, I thought my chance of [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3696.64s)]
*  being a superhero were well in the rear of your mirror. I was already nearly 40 years old at that [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3701.84s)]
*  point. And I had gotten to play the smaller role in the Thor franchise, but it didn't really do [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3706.96s)]
*  much. I was like, all right, I guess that was if I got one chip. And I was very grateful for that [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3712.0s)]
*  too. Like I got to be in that world, but I was like, I guess that was the chip that I played. And [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3716.24s)]
*  Hollywood wasn't banging down my door. So yeah, it was crazy for that to all happen as quickly as it [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3721.52s)]
*  did. So that's seven and a half years ago. And since then it's been just nonstop, right? I mean, [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3725.8399999999997s)]
*  it's just been, it seems like you've been on a tear. I, yeah, I mean, listen, it all depends on [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3730.3199999999997s)]
*  who you're talking to. Like I have been super blessed that I guess I continue to go on a tear [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3735.2s)]
*  and continue to work and be working on projects that I'm, I am very proud of and grateful to be [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3739.8399999999997s)]
*  doing. The Shazam as a franchise, the first one did pretty well. The second one didn't, right? So [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3743.92s)]
*  did those, it did all of a sudden the magical doors of Hollywood burst open and everyone, [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3751.2000000000003s)]
*  I got Spielberg being like, get Zachary Levi on the line. We got an Oscar performance we need in [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3756.88s)]
*  four, like, cause that's what he talks like apparently. Everyone's from the 1930s in Hollywood. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3761.2000000000003s)]
*  See now look here Buster. But so, no, those phone calls weren't rolling in, [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3764.88s)]
*  but it's all good. Like I, but you're a working actor doing great projects on the big screen. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3773.6s)]
*  Yeah. Like, like my dreams continue to be fulfilled every single day. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3777.68s)]
*  Why did Bill Maher think that you'd been canceled when you went on with him in December? [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3781.52s)]
*  Well, I mean, because I jokingly, when I got, as you pointed out earlier, I was supporting Bobby [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3785.2s)]
*  Kennedy, then the miracle in Butler and a bullet that would have changed the history of the world. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3792.48s)]
*  Speaking of God. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3798.7999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God, God, yes. And, but because of that, then I think the humility that started to run in [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3799.68s)]
*  Donald Trump in a way that I don't know that even existed prior to that and him reaching out to Bobby [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3805.52s)]
*  and creating this Alliance. And then I go and I'm like, okay, I guess I'm gonna, I'm gonna, [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3809.9199999999996s)]
*  I'm on the Trump train now, you know, one that I was never on prior, but one that I knew I needed [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3814.08s)]
*  to go beyond because of the state of everything and the team that he was collecting. And so Tulsi [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3818.0s)]
*  had reached out to me and was like, Hey, I'm doing, we're doing this town hall with Bobby. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3822.3999999999996s)]
*  Why did she reach out to you? Did she see that you were an arcade player? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3826.16s)]
*  We had run it. We had a mutual friend that introduced us. I, this, a trainer, like a physical, [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3828.24s)]
*  you know, a Pete, like a, you know, trainer at the gym that I knew from a gym here in New York who [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3833.8399999999997s)]
*  moved to Austin. And we, I said, Hey, would you come and, you know, I want to do a workout. She's [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3838.4799999999996s)]
*  like, cool. So should we do a workout? And we're talking about the state of the world. And I'm like, [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3842.64s)]
*  Oh man, that Tulsi Gabbard, I think she's the bee's knees. And she's like, I know Tulsi. I go [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3845.9199999999996s)]
*  train Tulsi sometimes. I go, Oh, well, I'd love to meet her someday. Cut to a week later. We're [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3849.4399999999996s)]
*  sitting down and we're all having coffee. And I'm telling her, I think you're awesome. I love what [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3852.9599999999996s)]
*  you stand for. I love that you have the balls to have been Democrat your entire career, but [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3856.32s)]
*  recognize that the party has been lost. The, the, the, the values that it once held, a lot of values [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3861.92s)]
*  that I even agree with have been lost. And you see that those values have transferred over here and [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3867.04s)]
*  you're supporting Trump. I'm like, that's amazing. I love all that. And I share all these same [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3871.04s)]
*  concerns and I want to be able to help in all of this, but I'm not sure what to do because [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3875.2000000000003s)]
*  I'm in Hollywood and that's a wacky thing. She's like, I get it. Get kicked out. And like a week [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3879.2000000000003s)]
*  later, I get a text or a week or two. I don't know what it was until she says, listen, we're [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3883.76s)]
*  on the campaign trail for truck. We're on the campaign trail supporting Trump, me and Bobby [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3888.48s)]
*  doing town halls. We would love for you to moderate one of those town halls. And I told her, [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3894.4s)]
*  I got to think and pray on this because this is really crossing the Rubicon. And, but I, [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3898.5600000000004s)]
*  but I did. And I felt peace again. I felt peace. I felt peace because I knew that this was more [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3902.96s)]
*  important than saving my career. I think that we too often fall into these, these paradigms, [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3907.76s)]
*  these thought processes of, of self preservation. And it is not good. We need to be wise and we, [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3915.1200000000003s)]
*  we want to survive and we want to live and flourish and all those things, but we can't [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3920.88s)]
*  merely make decisions off of, well, I hope nothing bad happens to me. You got to sacrifice. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3924.32s)]
*  You got to sacrifice. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3929.2000000000003s)]
*  I've told you that before. When the Trump team asked me to speak to him before him at his last [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3929.6800000000003s)]
*  rally before the vote, you know, the night before election day is not something a journalist would [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3935.68s)]
*  normally do. You know, that is crossing a line that you just don't normally cross. And even this [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3941.2799999999997s)]
*  whole show, my, my transformation into more of a pundit, a journalist too, but you know, my daily [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3945.2s)]
*  job is more punditry has been an evolution, but that's, that's a bigger line to cross. And I [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3950.48s)]
*  really same as he was like, I don't know if I should cross that, you know, it's like not because [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3955.7599999999998s)]
*  of blowback, but just because it's a before and after moment for me for sure as a journalist. [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3958.72s)]
*  But like you just said, I truly did feel called. Even my husband's like, I don't think you should [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3962.96s)]
*  do it, Meg, nothing against Trump. He was a Trump supporter, but he's like, you know, you don't, [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3967.2s)]
*  don't want the blowback. It's not a line you have to cross. And I'm like, honey, I got to do it. I [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3970.8s)]
*  don't know why I just know I do. And I was so glad I did it. Right. I didn't feel ashamed, bad on, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3975.28s)]
*  on the precipice of waiting, you know, the gunfire that was, you know, the rhetorical. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3984.7200000000003s)]
*  I felt totally empowered and like I was in exactly the right alignment, you know, [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3989.52s)]
*  where I was supposed to be. So I completely relate to what you're saying. But now for me, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3994.4s)]
*  the blowback would just be mean articles written about me by my fellow people in the press, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=3998.4s)]
*  which I've had millions of for you. It could be, it could cost you your career potentially. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4002.4s)]
*  At that point, you have to be thinking it could cost me my career. Oh, I did. I thought a lot [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4005.84s)]
*  about that and I prayed a lot about that. And I knew that I had a child that was, you know, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4008.96s)]
*  coming and on the way. And because even then my girlfriend and I knew that we were pregnant and [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4012.48s)]
*  I was like, okay, well, what am I doing? Like what, what will all this look like down the road? [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4016.32s)]
*  But again, at the end of the day, first of all, I've known since I was a kid that I was born and [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4022.96s)]
*  called to be a leader. I've known it like, and not like, not in weird romantic ways or anything, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4028.88s)]
*  like the world needs help and needs help. And the only way to go and help the world is to [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4035.6800000000003s)]
*  love the world. Like nobody hating the world is actually going to make it a better place. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4041.76s)]
*  They're just going to start cutting out the things that they don't like or whatever and cutting down [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4046.6400000000003s)]
*  the people that they don't like. But I really believe that we have to be able to see it as a [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4050.5600000000004s)]
*  whole and be like, okay, what can we do? How can we be effective change? So I already felt that [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4055.6800000000003s)]
*  calling on my life. And then when it came to this, I was like, so what am I worried about? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4060.32s)]
*  Am I worried if I feel like God is calling me to this? And I did. I was like, I think that this is [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4068.4s)]
*  this moment, because I was never trying to just like insert myself. I was like, God, if you want [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4072.88s)]
*  me to go and step out in a bigger way, I need you to, I need, you know, give me the call. And the [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4077.12s)]
*  call literally came from Tulsi Gabbard. And, and more than that, I'm very, I very, very much, [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4081.12s)]
*  and I've been preaching for a long time that I think AI is about to destroy my industry. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4087.28s)]
*  Yep. So I was like, so what am I, what am I worried? I know I love Justine Bateman. Oh my God. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4090.56s)]
*  Love it. And but I was like, so what am I really afraid of at the end of the day that I'm somehow [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4096.08s)]
*  going to lose jobs in an industry that I already believe is completely falling apart, and that [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4100.72s)]
*  won't even be creating jobs for me in a few years anyway? Like, come on. If I lose all of my acting [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4105.52s)]
*  career, and I hope I don't, and I and so far I haven't. And that's why Bill, I think was going [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4111.12s)]
*  back to the original question he because I jokingly said at the town hall, I said, you know, look, I [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4115.4400000000005s)]
*  this could make me a pariah and, you know, I might be a hereby announce my own cancellation. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4121.2s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. But it was a joke. But a joke knowing what full well that who knows who knows [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4125.36s)]
*  what the downstream effects would be. But none of that matters. If the world goes off a cliff, [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4130.24s)]
*  what does it matter? You know, that's why I said on the on the podcast when I talked to before, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4136.0s)]
*  what is it to gain the world but lose your soul in the process lose our ability to have liberty, [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4139.679999999999s)]
*  freedom, free speech, like the things that ironically, the people on the other side are [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4145.28s)]
*  all suggesting that Trump is trying to take away which I'm like, have you? Do you understand free [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4150.88s)]
*  speech? I think a lot of people don't understand free speech that it actually protects hate speech [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4156.0s)]
*  stuff that I don't want anyone to say I don't want any of that to come out of people's mouths. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4160.16s)]
*  But in order to hold the concept of free speech, we must protect that it can though. Yes, exactly, [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4164.16s)]
*  you know, and what the ACL use you used to fight for, which is I think the KKK. Yes, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4169.28s)]
*  yes. Because we must we must hold on to these things. Otherwise, democracy are our Republic, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4174.639999999999s)]
*  it all fails. And so it's like, listen, I'm not even giving up my life for that. I some people [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4180.5599999999995s)]
*  have died for that. Many people have died for that. If anything, my career dies, my acting career that [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4185.84s)]
*  I've been blessed enough to do for 25 years. If that's in the cards for me, then okay, God, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4191.44s)]
*  if I'm walking with God, God will protect me. I think part of the call that you heard and answered [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4195.84s)]
*  was part of a bigger thing that's happening in the country at the same time, which is [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4200.56s)]
*  more and more people feeling that same connection with Trump with his message with what he actually [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4204.32s)]
*  stands for, not what the left says he stands for, just a new the dawn of a new day in America where [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4210.64s)]
*  we're no longer obsessed with identity politics and dividing each other based on things we can't [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4216.4800000000005s)]
*  control about one another the way the very foundation of the Civil Rights Act and the [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4220.88s)]
*  14th Amendment and a lot of things that are foundational to our country's evolution that [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4224.64s)]
*  we've been eschewing for the past decade plus and Trump got got us back to he said we're ready. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4228.8s)]
*  We are ready to go back to our foundational beliefs on not dividing each other like that [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4235.76s)]
*  and having open debates about controversial subjects and listening to a guy like Bobby [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4240.08s)]
*  Kennedy instead of just dismissing him as a kook and listening to Tulsi Gabbard's different views [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4244.56s)]
*  on the Intelligence Committee even if they're loathed by more Republicans on the panel than [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4249.5199999999995s)]
*  they are by the Democrats on the panel. Let's listen. Maybe she's got some good ideas. The [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4254.879999999999s)]
*  whole country was just ready for that. Let's like you do with the edge of sketch. Let's just do it. [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4260.0s)]
*  Let's just okay. We need a clean slate, a clean a cleanse and transparency. Like why anyone? It's [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4265.599999999999s)]
*  very indicative of those who are complicit in the corruption when they are shouting for the rooftops. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4272.639999999999s)]
*  No transparency. We shouldn't be looking at these things. Look at how he's tearing everything apart. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4278.64s)]
*  It's like no. Why don't you want to know what's in all of our drugs and food and water and [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4283.12s)]
*  everything? Why don't you want to know that? By the way, we all deserve to know that. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4288.48s)]
*  These are our leaders. They're public servants. That is their freaking job. [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4294.0s)]
*  Not to tell us what's good for us and what's right and oh you'll know whatever information you need [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4298.56s)]
*  to know. They seem annoyed that we want to look underneath the hood. They are and that's why I [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4303.6s)]
*  think a lot of Americans, even people who didn't vote for Trump, his approval ratings are good [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4308.64s)]
*  because they're like hey listen at least the guy's doing what he said he was going to do [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4312.96s)]
*  and more than that these were some of the things I was kind of even secretly hoping he was going to [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4316.56s)]
*  do because damn it we do deserve to know what's going on and then that's informed consent. Then [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4320.4800000000005s)]
*  I'll know okay that's what's in a vaccine. That's what's in this drug. That's what's in my fruit [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4325.200000000001s)]

*  Understood but there's a part of me I don't I when I'm responding to people I'm actually not [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4407.04s)]
*  like I'm responding to them but I'm using it as an opportunity to say something important. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4413.92s)]
*  So it's really just seriously it's like because there's other people that might be slightly [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4418.48s)]

*  not just for them it's for whoever wants to go see it. You're a much sweeter person than I am. I think the audience [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4517.68s)]
*  knows that though. Now wait I know the answer to this but were you raised Catholic Christian? Yes but [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4522.5599999999995s)]
*  Catholic? I can't remember the denomination. My mom was raised Catholic okay and because of that [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4528.0s)]
*  rebelled big time. Well you must be feeling pretty good about your decision in the wake of the pope. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4532.88s)]
*  Have you seen that he's weighing in on Trump's immigration policy? He's in the hospital like he [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4538.64s)]
*  could be dying but he took a moment to condemn the determination to deport. He seems okay according [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4544.4800000000005s)]
*  to his statement with the those who have committed additional crimes in addition to being here [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4551.280000000001s)]
*  illegally but he's really upset about us wanting to deport people who are just here illegally. He [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4555.360000000001s)]
*  seems to want us to believe we have some moral obligation to let them stay in the country. This [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4562.240000000001s)]
*  from a man who lives in the Vatican which is surrounded by a big big fence. God bless [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4566.64s)]
*  Pope Francis. I don't wish for anything terrible to happen to him. He is very ill in the hospital [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4571.4400000000005s)]
*  right now but I'm sorry the nerve. This is not what Catholics need right now which is to have our [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4575.68s)]
*  you know the leader of the church scolding the American president for his immigration policy. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4581.4400000000005s)]
*  This is what makes people dislike religion. Are you Catholic? Yes. Raised Catholic your whole life? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4586.320000000001s)]
*  Yes still Catholic. Raising three little Catholics. Look at you. I mean I almost had my Presbyterian [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4590.320000000001s)]
*  husband over here. I was like pulling him over. He's like come out. I think it's the rulers on [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4594.64s)]
*  the knuckles that really scared him away. Listen I think that unfortunately while there are [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4599.76s)]
*  immense amounts of wonderful Catholics who really do love God and love their neighbor and want to [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4613.84s)]
*  do good in this world and have been very positively affected through their relationship with God [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4620.16s)]
*  through the religion of Catholicism. I am not a fan of organized religion writ large which is also [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4625.36s)]
*  not to say that I don't see the benefits that came from building civilization, morality, justice, [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4633.2s)]
*  like you know these various laws. I understand that and by the way even like diehard atheists [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4638.8s)]
*  see this right. There's a lot of people that that have come around and recognized like I don't believe [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4645.44s)]
*  in any of that stuff but I see the positive value that is brought to society, civilization writ large. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4649.04s)]
*  I don't know what's going on with the pope. I don't really keep a lot of tabs. I did see some [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4655.2s)]
*  of this being spoken about. I'm more concerned with and wondering just how much that role has [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4661.76s)]
*  become influenced by other agenda. I don't know that. Like getting the Catholic Church getting paid [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4669.92s)]
*  to help all these immigrants find housing etc. There's that. But also I'm not gonna lie it's made [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4676.88s)]
*  me think twice about putting money in the basket on Sundays. Like what exactly am I supporting? [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4682.8s)]
*  But I think there's even unfortunately more murky waters like even when it comes to things like [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4687.2s)]
*  the World Economic Forum and Davos and all of those people. I don't want to have to think about [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4695.76s)]
*  that crap. You know what I mean? I don't want my church doing that. I know you don't want to have [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4704.24s)]
*  to think about that but you should think about that. We all need to be aware of what is happening in [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4707.36s)]
*  the larger political game that's being played on the earth right now globally being played on the [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4712.5599999999995s)]
*  earth. I find it quite disconcerting that the pope is about to have a symposium summit about like health [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4717.28s)]
*  and human thriving and inviting people like Dr. Anthony Fauci. I think that is very and people from [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4728.24s)]
*  the World Economic Forum and all of this stuff. Now people can call me a conspiracy theorist and [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4736.16s)]
*  wow your tinfoil hat's too tight or whatever. I don't care guys. Like just go do a little research, [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4740.8s)]
*  dig online, follow the money, do all the things you need to do. There is corruption on the highest [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4747.92s)]
*  level not just in our country all around the world and I don't understand why that would even [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4753.76s)]
*  be going on. I don't understand why the pope would be like yeah you're the people of everything that [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4759.84s)]
*  continues to be revealed. You're the people that should be coming and having this symposium. The [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4764.0s)]
*  pope's not having any meetings in the short term. I mean he's actually truly not doing well so I mean [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4766.96s)]
*  I'm praying for him. I don't want him to die. I don't want anything bad to happen to him but he's [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4772.0s)]
*  he's very elderly and this is a serious lung problem. I don't know how this is going to go but [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4775.6s)]
*  to me it's actually kind of crazy because we're right in the midst of this Oscar season. One of [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4780.64s)]
*  the films nominated is this Conclave which is absolutely sacrilegious. It's a disgusting film [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4785.04s)]
*  in my opinion. They make the new pope, spoiler alert, intersex meaning he has a vagina. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4790.72s)]
*  It's like okay so now God forbid the pope dies and we go through a conclave which is the process by [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4797.84s)]
*  which they elect the new pope. Of course this is like we're going to be like could we make sure [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4803.12s)]
*  it's a man? At a bare minimum could we and it's going to be an explosive thing for the Catholic [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4807.36s)]
*  Church if and when it ultimately happens because there is a battle for the soul of the Catholic [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4811.92s)]
*  Church right now. There's a battle for the soul of the world. Yes. People who are you know genuinely [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4817.36s)]
*  committed look who have more conservative views and those who are far left and we have a far left [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4822.88s)]
*  pope right now which has led to the consternation of a lot of diehard Catholics when it comes to the [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4828.48s)]
*  Latin mass. There's a lot of issues. All right wait I want to shift gears because before we leave the [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4832.799999999999s)]
*  RFK discussion and God by the way this ties it all together he did take over at the National [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4836.72s)]
*  Institutes of Health at the at HHS this week and he made a comment which he's made before but it [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4842.320000000001s)]
*  doesn't get old on how meaningful it was for him and how important Trump has been really in changing [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4848.8s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy's life. Listen. For 20 years I've gotten up every morning on my knees and prayed [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4856.0s)]
*  that God would put me in a position where I can end the childhood chronic disease epidemic in this [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4865.4400000000005s)]
*  country. On August 23rd of last year God sent me President Trump and he gave me Mr. President. A [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4870.400000000001s)]

*  I'm so grateful to him and I've told you before I genuinely believe that you are a pivotal [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4894.8s)]

*  then it's like okay but we still got to get Bobby Tulsi you know all and so the other day I was on a [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=4960.32s)]

*  these things so I don't think we're out of the woods just yet so there's still a lot of work to [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5195.759999999999s)]

*  try a different one and they up the dosage there and there's no actual public health official being [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5262.639999999999s)]

*  to rip on those drugs they have been helpful for a lot of people but they're not for everybody and [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5272.08s)]
*  it's the first line of defense my friend has a daughter in college and she went to like the [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5275.92s)]
*  college counseling place because it can be a difficult adjustment they try to push an SSRI [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5280.96s)]

*  behavioral therapy before we just knee-jerk give the drug well absolutely but but I think [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5290.64s)]
*  that there's even more effective ways of solving for all of this and you really got to go to [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5295.92s)]
*  the source you got to go to the root right why are SSRIs pushed on everybody so much [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5301.6s)]
*  it's because there's incentive programs why are vaccines and the vaccine schedule pushed on [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5307.12s)]
*  children so hard because there's incentives why should there be incentives for doctors [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5311.76s)]
*  to push what should just be healthy and natural and good you shouldn't have to incentivize a [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5316.88s)]
*  doctor to encourage their their their patients to do something that's been tested and is safe and [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5322.64s)]
*  effective and everything you just have a doctor say oh this is great so why are you having to [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5327.84s)]
*  pay them x amount of dollars bonus to make sure if they get 95 percent of their pediatrician gets [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5332.0s)]
*  95 percent of the people in their in their practice and the children all fully backstab and then you [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5337.28s)]
*  give them hundreds of thousands of dollars in return this is not okay so I think that [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5342.8s)]
*  if we actually start to regulate these these industries all of that downstream pushing and [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5347.92s)]
*  stuff that's all going to kind of start to resolve itself and once it gets exposed 100 [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5353.12s)]
*  moreover I think when it comes to our farming situation listen maybe under FDR incentivizing [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5357.2s)]
*  farmers getting out of the great depression there's some there was some good that they were [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5363.68s)]
*  trying to do with all of that but all that did was led to it led to like bad capitalism run amok and [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5367.36s)]
*  people in industrial farming and companies like Monsanto creating glyphosate and atrazine and all [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5374.64s)]
*  of these things that are poisoning us which is why you can literally eat all the bread you want [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5380.64s)]
*  in europe and you can't eat any bread in the united states that's the point we don't have to [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5384.72s)]
*  have this on our wheat we don't have to eat our pasta and our bread we don't but what I think [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5387.76s)]
*  like one of the biggest first things that they can do is if you instead of incentivizing farmers [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5392.64s)]
*  to do massive monocropping with industrial fertilizer instead start incentivizing farmers [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5397.12s)]
*  and we by the way we must because to to incentivize farmers to have regenerative [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5403.200000000001s)]

*  tilling for monocropping it's destroying our environment so people that want to solve for [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5424.72s)]
*  all of these things guys we can help the environment and help the soil and bring down [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Anb5U-oaiI&t=5429.44s)]
