# Maher's White House Visit, and Senseless High School Student Stabbing, with Knowles & Ana Kasparian
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly welcome to the Megyn Kelly show is everyone nursing their liberation day hangover. Oh [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=0.0s)]
*  I [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=8.76s)]
*  Just okay, there's gonna be a bunch of tariffs [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=10.52s)]
*  Pretty much everyone is against it [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=15.32s)]
*  There's a strain of die-hard MAGA that is open-minded to doing something in a different way [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=18.04s)]
*  Because while the system has worked well for the top 1% [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=25.36s)]
*  It hasn't been working that great for the folks in the Rust Belt. I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=29.52s)]
*  For one say we give President Trump a chance [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=34.04s)]
*  There's no way he's going to let a bunch of economic pain rain down on the country [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=37.8s)]
*  For the next three and a half years without doing anything about it. He's talking about short-term pain [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=42.96s)]
*  for long-term gain [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=50.28s)]
*  We got the full announcement last night from Donald Trump about his new tariff plan [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=52.56s)]
*  it's basically 10% across the board for all countries and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=58.08s)]
*  higher on top of that depending on whether you're tariffing us or [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=62.84s)]
*  If there's some sort of trade deficit between our country and yours even without tariffs that we find [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=67.8s)]
*  unfair [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=74.2s)]
*  Like there are certain [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=75.44s)]
*  Regulations for example in Japan that make it virtually impossible for us to sell certain cars there [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=77.36s)]
*  Because we will never pass the regulations. Is that fair? Is it hard to get a Japanese car in America? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=82.36s)]
*  So Trump is jacking up tariffs on Japan [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=88.19999999999999s)]
*  Not necessarily based on their tariffs but based on a trade deficit because of regulations [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=91.32s)]
*  They've put in place that make it impossible for us to compete over there and the way they can hear [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=95.44s)]
*  That's what he's trying to rectify [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=100.08s)]
*  the defenders of of the free trade world [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=102.56s)]
*  Say yes, all of that sounds good on paper [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=106.92s)]
*  it said the unfairness is a very easy argument to make but [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=110.44s)]
*  Netnet we're still the strongest economy in the world because of our free trade [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=114.36s)]
*  we actually don't make a lot of things domestically and won't start to just because of this plan and [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=119.16s)]
*  That this is going to cause what's called stagflation where inflation goes up and the economy slows and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=127.12s)]
*  Eventually, we could see job losses. They're predicting all doom and gloom [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=134.6s)]
*  Why don't we give them a chance? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=138.6s)]
*  Why don't we see? [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=140.76s)]
*  how [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=142.67999999999998s)]
*  This changes things because over the last 25 years our manufacturing industry has been gutted. It's been sliced in half in [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=143.76s)]
*  half [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=152.48s)]
*  You know, I heard Adam Carolla talking about this the other day and it was a good point. He said as you know [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=154.07999999999998s)]
*  Half of LA burned and he was like, you know, you know who's out rebuilding it? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=159.95999999999998s)]
*  men men in excavators and dump trucks with bulldozers and shovels and bricklayers [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=164.07999999999998s)]
*  Men like that are gonna rebuild the palisades [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=172.27999999999997s)]
*  Men who nobody in the palisades probably gives two shits about that's the truth [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=176.88s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of those guys in this country who've seen what they know how to do best [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=183.0s)]
*  absolutely devastated by a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=188.44s)]
*  Globalist agenda that cares more about free trade than they do about our own American guys and [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=192.35999999999999s)]
*  Trump is of a different ilk and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=199.28s)]
*  He's never stopped thinking about these guys reportedly [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=202.51999999999998s)]
*  He read Rick Santorum's book on the manufacturing crisis and what we did to our own [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=205.04s)]
*  Before he ran for president [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=209.76s)]
*  It was basically Rick Santorum's platform when he ran for president and won [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=211.2s)]
*  Iowa a few years before Trump came on the national scene and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=215.39999999999998s)]
*  I don't think he's ever lost that their trip their clips of Trump back when he was in his 40s talking about we need tariffs [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  And thinking about the more working-class manufacturers of America. So this is something near and dear to his heart [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=225.20000000000002s)]
*  we have never in recent history given it a good try and [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=231.36s)]
*  I think we need to be patient with the president who ran very much on this [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=236.60000000000002s)]
*  Very much on this and deserves a shot. That's the tariffs. Okay, there's a lot of other things going on [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=241.68s)]
*  There's some really disturbing cultural stories that I want to get into because they say a lot about where we are [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=247.8s)]

*  Just some sort of long vendetta between the two or it was a cheating spouse [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=840.02s)]

*  You do as that father did look at the perpetrator and say [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=853.22s)]
*  How was he raised where was his family? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=857.98s)]

*  He was across from who takes out a knife and stabs another in the heart as their first response [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=871.04s)]
*  to an empty or not empty seat [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=878.0s)]

*  That's my that's my question to everyone involved at this school in this perpetrators alleged perpetrators community [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=885.1999999999999s)]

*  By the way, I think a lot of people have seen this kind of thing from individuals [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=901.56s)]
*  Where you just know you know often you know you won't even go approach them on the street [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=906.8s)]
*  You just know the the the all of the red flags all the warning signs, but in this culture [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=911.06s)]
*  We're not allowed to mention that we're not allowed to condemn [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=916.9599999999999s)]
*  Certain social arrangements and pathologies. We're not allowed to say that growing up in a two-family home for instance where [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=921.6400000000001s)]
*  The virtues are cultivated and the vices are suppressed that that's better than the alternative frankly [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=929.6400000000001s)]
*  We're no longer even allowed to admit that there's a difference between vice and virtue [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=935.0s)]
*  Certainly when you add the racial aspect into this then you're not allowed to say peep whatsoever [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=938.6400000000001s)]
*  And so the people who ignored those red flags out of cowardice and radical ideology [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=943.0400000000001s)]
*  They have blood on their hands and not just in this case, but in many similar cases around the country [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=949.76s)]
*  How many more of these kinds of incidents are going to have to occur before? [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=955.88s)]
*  We we gain the courage and the clarity again to say you know [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=960.64s)]
*  Certain social pathologies really need to be suppressed there are better ways to live [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=965.88s)]
*  It's not just you do you and I'll do me we live in a society [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=971.8s)]
*  And so when people get married that affects me when people get divorced that affects me when people have children out of wedlock [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=976.84s)]
*  That affects me when people have children within wedlock that affects me when when the law is enforced that affects me when [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=984.48s)]
*  Children are educated you know in a proper way [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=992.5200000000001s)]
*  That's going to affect me too because I live in society all right [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=995.08s)]
*  And I as a citizen in this country and as a person with conscience as a rational creature [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=998.5200000000001s)]

*  totally predictable result of that [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1014.52s)]
*  there's so much in there that everything is that is brilliant and important the [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1017.12s)]
*  Black Lives Matter Plaza in Washington DC was just scrubbed and taken down [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1023.36s)]
*  Here we are five years later. I almost [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1029.36s)]
*  Exactly five years later right George Floyd was the end of May in 2020 [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1032.92s)]
*  and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1037.92s)]
*  What what did that group accomplish? [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1039.4s)]
*  What the number of cancellations that they pushed for you know that all about cops? [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1041.88s)]
*  It was all about what these allegedly racist cops were doing coast to coast just hunting black men right now how LeBron put it? [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1047.76s)]
*  This [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1056.2399999999998s)]
*  What's happening in with a lack of fathers in several black homes not every black home? [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1057.2399999999998s)]
*  And this isn't about black people there [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  Black people listening to show right now who are as outraged over this as we are [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1064.2399999999998s)]
*  But there is a problem with fatherless homes in a large portion of the black community [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1068.08s)]
*  And where is the push on that where where would these black leaders Patricia colors and the others to try to do something? [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1073.9199999999998s)]
*  To try to do something about that which actually would have helped black kids and all kids [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1081.0s)]
*  For I have a say for future the people to blame here [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1087.88s)]
*  You know for creating these kinds of conditions are are not only the ones who look the other way [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1091.1200000000001s)]
*  But but yes as you mentioned these really bad actors who have who have pushed a [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  Terrible behavior who have encouraged the worst kind of lawlessness [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1102.64s)]
*  That is contrary to the good of the individual and to the good of society and who have been given [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1106.8s)]
*  Grants and prizes and and all sorts of plaudits for it. You know, I remember walking by that BLM Plaza in DC [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1112.08s)]
*  I thought this is this is such another level of social degradation [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1120.72s)]
*  Not only are we tolerating that this kind of disordered behavior, but we're actually exalting it [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1124.84s)]
*  We're saying this is this is a great thing [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1131.72s)]
*  So people are going to be led, you know [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1134.2s)]
*  I mean that this is where the hyper individualism of the left and the right just totally breaks down [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1137.1200000000001s)]
*  We are social creatures. We've known that since good old uncle Aristotle and so we are going to we're gonna follow the leader [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1142.96s)]
*  We're gonna behave in ways that that our neighbors behave [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1149.84s)]
*  And so we have a real question before us which is what kind of country do we want to live in? [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1153.32s)]
*  What kind of society do we want to live in? You know, it that is your business. All right [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1158.2s)]
*  The society that we grow up in is your business you as a citizen have a right to certain standards [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1162.96s)]
*  And so when you look at all of the risk factors for this kind of behavior fatherlessness [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1168.24s)]
*  Of course, we've talked about the the soft bigotry of low expectations as it's called in education [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1173.88s)]
*  The encouragement of vice and the the mockery and dismissal of virtue on the grounds that you know [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1179.96s)]
*  We can't be moralized or we have a separation of church and state or whatever kind of a historical nonsense [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1185.7s)]
*  The radical left pushes, you know [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1190.96s)]
*  Well, the consequence of that is that you're going to live in an increasingly anarchical kind of society that isn't good for anyone [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1193.3600000000001s)]
*  it [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1200.56s)]
*  Damages the people that it supposedly intends to help you certainly saw that with BLM [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1201.8400000000001s)]
*  But let's not forget the innocent people here as well. It also damages [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1206.56s)]
*  The innocent and and that is deeply unjust and if the government can't do something about that [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1211.88s)]
*  Then the government is shirking its chief responsibility [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1217.3600000000001s)]
*  It's not [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1221.3600000000001s)]
*  Totally dissimilar from what happened with the Nashville shooter [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  that woman who went into a [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1228.04s)]
*  Lower school and killed six people at the Covenant School in Nashville March 27th [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1232.24s)]
*  2023 [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1238.76s)]
*  We don't say the name of the mass shooters here, but it was a woman who was having gender [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1240.4s)]
*  Dysphoria and was trying to become a male or wanted people to think of her as a male and [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1247.8400000000001s)]
*  This was the case in which our audience may remember they refused to release the manifesto [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1254.24s)]
*  They said it would be too disturbing. It would be too dangerous and then about a year plus ago [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  Steven Crowder got his hands on [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1264.8000000000002s)]
*  At least a piece of the manifesto and released it and this woman had all these bizarre trans fantasies [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1267.3200000000002s)]
*  Involving having male sex like she would be the male with her stuffed animals [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1273.26s)]
*  And how if she would just go up to heaven after committing all these murders. She was sure God would put her in a boy body [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1278.42s)]
*  Completely whitewashed like the media did not want the cops. Nobody wanted to talk about the trans element of this woman's [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1285.78s)]
*  craziness of her insanity and now they finally [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1295.5800000000002s)]
*  Concluded their investigation on this Covenant school killer and they release a 48 page report which does not include the word trans [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1299.5s)]
*  It does not include the word trans it has other passing references to some gender issues, but it's it's completely downplayed [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1308.22s)]
*  It's like it was you know [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1315.94s)]
*  Basically not relevant to it [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1318.3000000000002s)]
*  this is a [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1322.0600000000002s)]
*  little bit of the reporting despite needing more than two years to complete his investigation the [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1323.9s)]
*  Police Department confirmed that this person acted alone and during the attack during the attack itself [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1329.0600000000002s)]
*  No one around the killer had knowledge that she was planning the attack. Although her parents knew she had thoughts about killing her father [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1335.38s)]
*  They found that her parents her mental health providers and the firearm retailers who sold her the weapons bore no [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1342.94s)]
*  responsibility and had no prior knowledge of her plans and [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1349.26s)]
*  Now they state in this conclusion that she didn't leave behind a manifesto Michael [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1353.22s)]
*  Because it wasn't laid out in one single document [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1359.3s)]
*  That that there's all sorts of justification for this listen to this they write early in the investigation. It was suggested that [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1363.06s)]
*  This shooter left behind a manifesto detailing her motives and intentions by definition a manifesto is a mission statement or other document written and [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1369.58s)]
*  Disseminated by an individual or group to enumerate or expound upon the guiding principles and beliefs that inform their actions [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1377.84s)]
*  Regardless of length a manifesto is a single document that outlines all the factors intentions and objectives of an individual act or a series [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1384.4399999999998s)]
*  Of actions in this case a manifesto did not exist [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1391.8s)]
*  The shooter never left behind a single document explaining why she committed the act [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1394.84s)]
*  Why she specifically targeted the Covenant and what she hoped to gain if anything with the attack? [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  Really now that's now they've been saying for two years that it would be too dangerous [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1404.52s)]
*  They didn't think we could handle it. It's too disturbing now suddenly [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1410.3600000000001s)]
*  It's oh it didn't exist because it was in the form of multiple documents and not just one [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1414.2s)]
*  I feel like we're looking at parallel stories in a way here where the the shooter the killer is [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1419.3600000000001s)]
*  In a protected group about whom you are not allowed to say certain things or ask certain questions [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1426.16s)]
*  The the excuse might as well be that manifestos are always saved as PDF files [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1432.8400000000001s)]
*  And this was a doc X so not a manifesto not going to release it [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1438.0800000000002s)]
*  It's so flimsy and it contradicts what they've been saying for years at this point [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1441.68s)]
*  But but of course they were going to ignore the central feature here. We've been talking about red flags [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1445.72s)]
*  We've been talking about the the the ideological and cultural insistence that we not acknowledge [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1451.48s)]
*  What's before our own eyes? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1457.88s)]
*  So in this case you want to know what a red flag might be that you have a person who is as [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1459.88s)]
*  Mentally ill as it is possible to be a person who doesn't understand some of the most basic aspects of her own [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1465.68s)]
*  identity I would like to know that as the parent of [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1472.68s)]
*  Someone who is at a school. I would like to know if there are really crazy people [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1476.8000000000002s)]
*  People who not only have a flawed perception of reality [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1482.68s)]
*  But who are part of a group that is [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1486.76s)]
*  Singularly violent and committing violence not only against others, but notably at at [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1489.4s)]
*  unmatched rates against themselves a group of people that has a real problem that a caring society would try to fix and [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1495.4s)]
*  Remedy rather than affirm and make worse that that's the sort of thing that I would like [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1503.64s)]
*  But that has to be ignored because the the culture tells us that we have to exalt for ourselves [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1507.72s)]
*  The the culture tells us that we have to exalt falsehood and we have to deny truth [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1513.6399999999999s)]
*  So then when one of these people flies off the handle it we all have to act surprised [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1519.36s)]
*  I I have been going out and speaking in public [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1524.6399999999999s)]
*  For I don't know ten years or something now is part of my show and part of my part of my public life [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1527.7199999999998s)]
*  I've been attacked precisely on two occasions physically [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1532.6s)]
*  Both times it was because I discussed the question of transgenderism [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1536.6799999999998s)]
*  One time was right at the beginning of my speaking the other time was a couple years ago some antifa guy [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1540.92s)]
*  was so furious at my [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1547.28s)]
*  Observation that transgenderism isn't real that he tried to blow me up when I was giving a speech and he seriously injured a female [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1549.64s)]
*  Police officer. I've talked about a lot of other issues and it's not just me. There are many people on the right [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1554.94s)]
*  For whom this is the case the minute you question the trans ideology these people who are so obviously and notably insane [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1560.48s)]
*  Will fly off the handle can we say that I'll probably be censored from social media for acknowledging that right now [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1568.5800000000002s)]
*  But let me just ask the people who are literally talking about a so-called trans person who killed six [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1574.98s)]
*  Three six-year-olds and three adults. It's absolutely factual in the case that we are discussing at this moment [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1581.78s)]
*  Please keep going without question [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1588.22s)]
*  And my question to them by the way who say that we need to lie to people in order to mollify them that they you know [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1590.3400000000001s)]
*  Lies will set you free and the truth is cruel a complete inversion of what we've known in our civilization for thousands of years [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1596.3s)]
*  My question to them is who does that serve? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1602.8999999999999s)]
*  Does that is is the trans identifying girl who shot up the school and then was happily killed by a police officer is she better [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1605.6599999999999s)]
*  Off because of that. How about this kid the perpetrator? [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1612.02s)]
*  Just yesterday who murders a 17 year old promising kid because he flies off the handle is he is he served well by [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1615.6599999999999s)]
*  By just ignoring red flags and that guy's life is over as well [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1622.9799999999998s)]
*  And he's and he's got to live with the grievous sin of having taken another life who who benefits from living in a society full of? [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1627.3799999999999s)]
*  Lies nobody does I mean it's a it's a total Faustian bargain [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1634.26s)]
*  You know give up the truth live in lies [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1638.1799999999998s)]
*  And then at least some people will be happy and the conclusion of it is none of us are happy and the whole society is degraded [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1640.62s)]
*  the [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1647.78s)]
*  Just before we leave this up this subject here [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1649.1s)]
*  Here's just a couple of statements that Steven Crowder reported on when he broke this story last year that did not [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1651.6599999999999s)]
*  Did not wind up in the police report [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1657.78s)]

*  Here's more the Tennessee Star reported on some of what was found in [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1691.06s)]

*  whitewashed for some [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1756.18s)]
*  Sake of being sensitive to their particular and by the way one of the things that they we also learn about the shooter [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1758.3s)]
*  That's not shocking is she was on the autism spectrum and the reason I say it's it's not that people on the spectrum murder [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1763.6200000000001s)]

*  I worked at Fox News for 14 years. There wasn't a teacher sex scandal [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1951.78s)]
*  We didn't cover there but there's some level of depravity in our society [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1954.94s)]
*  I mean, that's really what we're talking about [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1959.5400000000002s)]
*  there's some level of depravity and in some cases mental illness and [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1960.9s)]
*  This woman well, yes, she's a woman. So technically in one of the favorite classes that that's not what this story is about [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1965.8200000000002s)]
*  She is getting some press coverage, but there's something wrong with a woman if as she's accused of doing [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1971.9s)]
*  Who has whether say accusing her of raping a 15 year old student? [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1979.5400000000002s)]
*  She no one is saying that her student who she allegedly raped [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1985.18s)]
*  Sex without consent was special ed, but she was a special ed teacher at the school [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1989.18s)]
*  So I don't know whether he was or he wasn't but he was 15 years old. It happened in [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=1995.22s)]
*  2023 [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2001.38s)]

*  He was a soccer player that she coached and she was also tutoring this young man and the mother of course went [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2013.22s)]
*  Bullshit when she found the text messages. So this woman gets pulled over [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2021.34s)]
*  There's a couple of pieces of tape here [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2026.74s)]
*  She gets pulled over by police with her husband in the passenger seat [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2028.74s)]
*  She's in the driver's seat a couple of days ago. Here's a bit of that [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2034.18s)]
*  So we do have an investigation going on we have to talk to you about it the police department, okay [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2037.9s)]
*  So where's my everything to do there? [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2042.78s)]
*  It's not my investigation. I don't know the full details. We do have to bring you there though. Okay? [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2044.78s)]
*  So I just put you in handcuffs and bring it to the police department just a dog. Yes, unfortunately [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2049.42s)]
*  I'm like willing to go with I did it. Yeah, unfortunately. We had to do it that way. It's do a favor. We just take this off [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2054.2200000000003s)]
*  Ask you what? [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2061.58s)]
*  Can I ask you what course yeah, it's not like I said some investigation I've seen we have a reason to turn her off for me [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2064.14s)]
*  At the moment [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2071.58s)]
*  Investigation that's all I can really tell you right now. I'm sorry. I wish I could tell you more [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2073.86s)]
*  I really would prefer that my husband's with me, of course [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2076.8199999999997s)]
*  Okay, so she's very angry that the husband can't come with her she's arrested not really understanding what she's arrested for [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2085.86s)]
*  Supposedly, I mean [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2092.1s)]
*  Okay [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2094.02s)]
*  How many crimes had she committed because that one should have been pretty obvious and on the nose and then there's tape later [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2095.38s)]
*  Where it's dawning on her what she's in trouble for and what's about to happen to her here it is [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2101.94s)]
*  She learned the charges by this point she's in the back of the cop [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2114.94s)]
*  Oh [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2121.42s)]
*  What we won't see is the video of this boy's mother crying at night in her bed [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2143.66s)]
*  I am sure the night she discovered that this had happened to her son. I have a 15 year old [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2150.16s)]
*  They're young. They are not yet men. They are [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2156.72s)]
*  Coming of age at age 15. This is absolutely disgusting [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2160.96s)]
*  She just to complete the narrative is denying that she sexually assaulted the student [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2166.12s)]
*  She said quote everyone comes after her because she is good-looking [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2170.92s)]
*  That's the quote because she is good-looking according to court documents. She was arrested earlier [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2174.8399999999997s)]
*  March on March 16th [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2180.4s)]
*  She confessed to police that she cared too much about the student but claimed he broke into her phone and sent these problematic [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2182.24s)]
*  text messages as [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2189.7999999999997s)]
*  Blackmail that I guess she wasn't participating in the back-and-forth [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2191.8399999999997s)]
*  She claimed that one day he grabbed her phone unattended had entered her passcode [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2195.04s)]
*  Because yeah every fit my 15 year old certainly knows the passcode of all of his teachers iPhones [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2200.16s)]
*  Had sent the message to his own phone had then deleted the message from her phone and had saved it to his phone as [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2205.8599999999997s)]
*  Blackmail the the messages included as follows her writing to him [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2214.02s)]
*  I love you so much baby, even though this morning was short. It was perfect student responded [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2218.56s)]
*  I know baby. It was perfect baby. So perfect. She wrote I love having sex with you [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2225.22s)]
*  It's pretty good admission for the prosecution student responded I know baby I love it so much it feels so good [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2231.18s)]
*  It's so passionate. It's so intimate. It's so perfect [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2237.2999999999997s)]
*  On top of all that can continue thinking in your mind of what her defense is. He wrote all of that [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2240.9s)]
*  He grabbed my phone. He knew my passcode [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2246.2799999999997s)]
*  He wrote all that you wrote all the back-and-forth and then deleted my half of the conversation from my phone [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2247.7799999999997s)]
*  Which is just already such utter nonsense court documents allege that this the teacher [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2252.8599999999997s)]
*  Christina formella is her name had also written about the student in her notes app on her phone [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2259.54s)]
*  For nella for Mella told police she had used the app as an outlet for her anxiety and [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2266.8999999999996s)]
*  References about sex were only about her husband [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2273.2999999999997s)]
*  So that is the story of Christina for Mella again denying all charges [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2277.9399999999996s)]
*  But in a lot of trouble today Michael and I'm assuming that the police have their woman and that this went down as they [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2283.5s)]
*  Allege it is yet another example of just some sort of [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2291.7s)]
*  strange and severe [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2296.5s)]
*  cultural depravity [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2298.8599999999997s)]
*  Well, Megan I have to ask you know if we've got the notes and we've got the text messages at what point is the police [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2303.06s)]
*  Department to come out and say you know we have this video of this woman saying on camera [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2310.36s)]
*  I'm about to commit this crime with this student [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2314.42s)]
*  Then she's gonna say it was actually AI it was grok that made that video and then there's gonna be another video [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2316.4s)]
*  It says I am this is not AI [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2320.44s)]
*  I mean they might as well she might have done a live performance for all of the evidence against her and yet [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2321.84s)]
*  You do have to ask yourself [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2328.1200000000003s)]
*  How did we end up in this place where these stories are so totally normalized and the first? [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2329.6800000000003s)]
*  Question that comes to me when I think about the story we were just previously talking about is [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2335.6400000000003s)]
*  if a child at [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2340.06s)]
*  16 years old 14 years old 10 years old 8 years old [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2342.42s)]
*  has the right to make a [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2346.1s)]
*  permanent sexual decision a decision to sterilize himself to remove his genitals or her genitals to [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2348.94s)]
*  Do you know really long-term decisions then why doesn't a 15 year old have the ability to consent to a romp with his teacher? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2355.62s)]
*  He doesn't question obviously despite all the reactions, you know, where were these teachers when I was in school [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2363.06s)]
*  We have age of consent for a reason but we only apply it conveniently [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2368.04s)]
*  And when we're talking about long-term sexual decisions, no, no, that's totally fine. The child can come so right [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2373.0s)]
*  You know the child could consent at five years old [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2379.04s)]
*  So that's the first part second part is we've been told since the 1960s at least that sex is no big deal [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2380.84s)]
*  You know, it's just like a handshake [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2386.56s)]
*  It's not the sort of thing that's really just for husband and wife for serious people who are committed who are open to the possibility [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2388.16s)]
*  Of a child which is the product of sex. No, no, no, no, it's just like a handshake man [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2393.2s)]
*  It's no big deal [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2397.24s)]
*  But then this creates a bizarre contradiction because we're told sex doesn't mean anything at all [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2397.9599999999996s)]
*  But sexual assault is much worse than any other kind of assault. Well, how is that? [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2403.2s)]
*  I don't you know [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2407.4799999999996s)]
*  If sex is just a handshake it is between two people who can consent and if children can consent now do according to this logic [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2408.54s)]
*  Then why is this a news story at all? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2415.4399999999996s)]
*  They just it just shows you the huge gap between what we all know to be true with our common sense and [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2417.52s)]
*  The law and the popular culture that it's been foisted on us by radical ideologues now for half a century or more [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2423.8s)]
*  Okay, speaking of the trans issue [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2431.2s)]
*  I [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2434.08s)]
*  Don't know if you saw this viral video yesterday [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2435.32s)]
*  I saw it on the icons feed on X but there was a young woman a fencer USA fencer [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2437.52s)]
*  Stephanie Turner is her name and [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2444.36s)]
*  she was competing in a fencing match and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2447.28s)]
*  For USA fencing [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2451.88s)]
*  As part of it and she was placed up against a male pretending to be female and look at this Michael [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2454.68s)]
*  She took a knee [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2461.8s)]
*  She took a knee [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2463.4s)]
*  She refused [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2465.16s)]
*  To to fight there. He is [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2467.16s)]
*  Towering over her by the way [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2470.4s)]
*  She said I saw that I was going to be in a [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2472.92s)]
*  Pool meaning a fencing pool with Redmond his name is Redmond Sullivan and from there I said, okay [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2476.84s)]
*  Let's do it. I'm gonna take the knee [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2483.24s)]
*  I knew what I had to do because USA fencing had not been listening to women's objections [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2485.28s)]
*  I took a knee immediately and Redmond Sullivan was under the impression that I was going to start fencing [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2489.44s)]
*  When I took the knee I looked at the ref and I said, I'm sorry. I cannot do this [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2494.48s)]
*  I am a woman and this is a man and this is a woman's tournament and I will not fence this individual [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2498.0s)]
*  Redmond did not hear me. He came up to me. He thinks I may be hurt or he doesn't understand what's happening [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2506.24s)]
*  He asked are you okay? And I said, I'm sorry. I have much love and respect for you, but I will not fence you [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2511.44s)]
*  Shortly thereafter USA fencing produced a statement in support of [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2520.0s)]
*  the man [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2525.2s)]
*  Sullivan and transgender participation in the sport and [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2526.48s)]
*  Stephanie Turner the female was disqualified [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2532.64s)]
*  as a result of all this [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2536.0s)]
*  She's a heroine that took a lot of guts and god only knows how hard she worked [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2538.16s)]
*  Right to get to this point this guy [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2544.56s)]
*  Redmond Sullivan [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2547.84s)]
*  was a male and living as a male a [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2549.32s)]
*  Year and two years ago. Look, this is the beginning of his transition [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2553.4s)]
*  We'll show you some earlier pictures of him, which I saw online earlier where he's a fat [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2557.72s)]
*  Rather unattractive man [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2563.7200000000003s)]
*  Just like two seasons earlier. And of course, you won't be surprised to learn not a very good fencer [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2566.52s)]
*  You know the only place that a woman has ever beaten a man is a sword in a sword fight is [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2573.92s)]
*  Disney movies and Star Wars recently Snow White, right? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2579.56s)]
*  She's taking on men with swords [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2583.42s)]
*  But in reality no woman has ever beaten a man in a sword fight or really in any physical [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2584.7200000000003s)]
*  Endeavor, it just doesn't happen that way [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2592.2799999999997s)]
*  And so this this woman was not only principled to take a stand here, but she was also just prudent [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2594.88s)]
*  You know a note a woman should not be putting herself in a situation [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2600.9s)]
*  Where she is engaged in any kind of physical activity up to and including fencing with with men and you know [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2604.04s)]
*  She's just the right to her own [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2610.3199999999997s)]
*  Sports leagues, of course [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2612.8399999999997s)]
*  But I want to answer preemptively a criticism that I know that we're going to get from the left on this [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2614.2799999999997s)]
*  Which is the left is going to say you conservatives you don't really care about women's sports [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2619.08s)]
*  Well, I know you talk about it all the time and it's a 95 5 issue and it helps win elections for Republicans [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2625.92s)]
*  But you conservatives you don't really care about women's sports to which I say [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2632.08s)]
*  You're right. I don't I don't care at all about the WNBA. I don't care about women's soccer [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2636.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't care about men's soccer for that matter [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2643.44s)]
*  I don't care about women's fencing what I care about is justice [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2645.56s)]
*  That is why conservatives are focusing on this issue [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2649.8399999999997s)]
*  It is unjust to subject women to these competitions with men [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2652.8399999999997s)]
*  First of all where they could get traumatic brain injuries as we saw in the volleyball competition [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2657.6s)]
*  It's also unjust to take women's trophies away [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  It's it's certainly unjust to take women's university scholarships away and it's just not right, you know [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2664.52s)]
*  Why don't we let men into the women's sports leagues because they're called women's sports leagues and that's not right and we need to live [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2671.04s)]
*  In accordance with reality in a way that befits a civilized society. That's why you're right [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2676.8s)]
*  I'm never gonna watch women's fencing ever but women ought to have the right to their sports leagues and we as citizens have the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2681.92s)]
*  Right to insist upon justice if if we don't then what's the point of the government? [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2688.6800000000003s)]
*  Exactly, right. Here's here are the stats on this male fencer [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2694.2400000000002s)]
*  He after he graduated from high school began attending Wagner College in Staten Island [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2698.7200000000003s)]
*  He joined the men's fencing team in June of 2023 [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2703.0800000000004s)]
*  He placed 29th out of 58 male competitors and in November of 2023 six months later [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2706.6000000000004s)]
*  He began competing in women's fencing [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2714.2000000000003s)]
*  by November 2024 he won [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2717.7000000000003s)]
*  3-0 all of his matchups and in December 2024 [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2720.72s)]
*  He won gold at the Connecticut Division Junior Olympic qualifier in the junior women's foil [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2725.04s)]
*  this event at which she took the knee his competitor was the USA fencing event at the University of [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2732.04s)]
*  Maryland and again [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2738.68s)]
*  She received a black card exclusion from competition for refusing to compete against this man [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2740.3999999999996s)]
*  Redmond Sullivan and honestly like shame on [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2745.44s)]
*  USA fencing for not creating an open division where Redmond could go compete [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2749.1s)]
*  Shame on them for relegating this guy to only the women's [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2755.2799999999997s)]
*  Division I mean he could have fences a male and shame on him for cheating because he knows full well [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2759.92s)]
*  He went through male puberty has full male advantage and that he's stealing the medals the only sympathetic [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2765.22s)]
*  Characters in this entire thing as is typical is the actual real women who are left with [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2772.0s)]
*  Nothing, but bad choices Michael when they get faced with a guy like this [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2779.52s)]
*  Well, and then the question for US fencing and all of these other sports leagues is okay [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2783.9199999999996s)]
*  What are they gonna do about it could they as you suggested make it? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2788.72s)]
*  I don't know a third league, you know you get the men's league and the women's league and then the trans league [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2792.24s)]
*  Well that probably won't work because you got two kinds of trans that the man who identifies as a woman and the woman who identifies [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2796.32s)]
*  As a man and so because they're still really men and women you can't have them fighting each other there [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2802.88s)]
*  You're just back at the same problem [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2808.2400000000002s)]
*  So okay, you could have the trans league one the M to W trans league and then the W to M trans league [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2809.6600000000003s)]
*  But then of course, what about the people who don't identify as men or women, you know [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2816.2000000000003s)]
*  What about the people who are pansexual? [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2820.3s)]
*  That's that this is my quire we could either have 150 leagues or [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2826.48s)]
*  We can do something that they're gonna be some people even on the center, right? [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2830.8s)]
*  Don't support which is just insist upon reality. Can we all just insist upon reality, please? [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2834.52s)]
*  Yeah, he convinced with the men [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2840.84s)]
*  The bathrooms they say well instead of having a male bathroom a female bathroom [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2842.96s)]
*  Let's have a third one or a fourth one or a fifth one [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2846.96s)]
*  No [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2848.7200000000003s)]
*  how about we just have two because there are only many women and [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2849.2000000000003s)]
*  Change and let's just be real and you have to act normal because we live in society [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2852.36s)]
*  I got to get this what last one and the woman who played Elphaba in wicked the movie [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2856.52s)]
*  she just won an Academy Award for the performance Cynthia Erivo goes by they them and [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2861.16s)]
*  Explained why at the glad awards this weekend [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2867.32s)]
*  It isn't easy [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2871.96s)]
*  None of it is [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2875.04s)]
*  waking up and choosing to be yourself [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2877.4s)]
*  Proclaiming a space belongs to you when you don't feel welcomed [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2880.44s)]
*  teaching people on a daily basis how to address you and dealing with the frustration of [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2884.48s)]
*  Re-teaching people a word that has been in the human vocabulary since the dawn of time [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2889.76s)]
*  they them [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2894.6s)]
*  Words used to describe pedantically to or more people [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2899.44s)]
*  poetically a person who is simply more [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2904.32s)]
*  What do you what do you make of it Michael it's exhausting [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2910.16s)]
*  Just to be yourself is the hardest thing to be and I thought no that's not true [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2915.48s)]
*  Like being a mathematician is harder probably or a welder or like a marathon runner [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2920.92s)]
*  Or it's it's actually not that hard to wake up and be yourself and the irony of course is the people at this awards gala [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2925.36s)]
*  Are insisting upon not being themselves and not not living in accord with their [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2931.2400000000002s)]
*  When you're gonna hijack and a pre-existing term in the English language like they them and try to make it mean something totally different [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2936.0s)]
*  Yeah, you're probably gonna have some splaining to do [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2943.2s)]

*  then that we we need to live in accord with reality because because at a really basic political level if we all have the [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2955.56s)]
*  Right to our own subjective identity then we can't communicate with each other [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2962.68s)]
*  We can't know anything about each other and we become a grunting roving bands of baboons even worse because we deny our own [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=2966.7599999999998s)]

*  Theme we are starting to see pop up more and more is people in high places [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3112.96s)]
*  Being accused of committing the most disturbing crimes with all the accusations coming out against P. Diddy and other big names lately [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3117.0s)]
*  It's become very clear there was a lot of sickening and bizarre stuff that happens behind closed doors in Hollywood [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3124.48s)]
*  So long crime has made a new channel on YouTube with a mission to expose the dark side of fame [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3130.56s)]
*  From the disturbing rumors floating around Hollywood to legal battles erupting between celebrities their new channel is called [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3136.6s)]
*  Scandal and it's dedicated to exposing all of that and more if that sounds like it's up your alley [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3144.5s)]
*  And you want to know more go check it out go to law and crime's new channel [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3150.02s)]
*  Scandal and subscribe so you don't miss a video [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3155.02s)]
*  Joining me now someone from the other side of the aisle Anna Kasparian [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3159.54s)]
*  She's host and executive producer of the young Turks and a welcome back great to see you [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3162.86s)]
*  Alright, so this could be your future you as somebody who is not necessarily in the Donald Trump fan club [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3169.26s)]
*  I would I like I wouldn't I don't see you in the red hat [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3175.54s)]
*  You too, if you know Kid Rock at all [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3177.82s)]
*  Or even I think I could do it could get invited to the White House to sit down with Donald Trump [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3181.98s)]
*  He brought Bill Maher. He was on Bill Maher show [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3188.46s)]
*  He convinced Bill Maher to go to the White House to the satisfaction of no one now. No one wanted to see this [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3191.1000000000004s)]
*  It's kind of like when Mika and Joe went to Mar-a-Lago and [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3196.86s)]
*  Bill did it even though he really doesn't like Donald Trump and he says he's gonna talk about it on his show [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3200.78s)]
*  I guess he's off this Friday, but I guess the following Friday [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3206.5s)]
*  But in the meantime, we're getting a flavor for what went down because Kid Rock went on Fox and Friends the next morning and said this [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3209.5s)]
*  me Bill Dana White and [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3216.42s)]
*  And it could not have been better. Everyone was so surprised so so pleasant [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3219.26s)]
*  The most shocking thing to me was you know, Bill's obviously very big liberal been very hard in the president [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3223.7400000000002s)]
*  But he's donated a lot of money to other politicians. You know, you've had Biden Clinton Obama everybody [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3228.54s)]
*  He had never been to the White House and the president was so gracious [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3233.98s)]
*  He took us up to the private residence [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3237.1000000000004s)]
*  We saw the Gettysburg address in the Lincoln bedroom and I was like you've never been here bill and I was like, how about this? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3238.94s)]
*  President Trump, you know [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3244.7000000000003s)]
*  Extending this olive branch and like and we talked about things we had in common, you know ending wokeness, you know [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3246.3s)]
*  You know securing the border, you know, the president was asking him what he thought about policy [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3251.7400000000002s)]
*  You know going on with Iran and Israel and things it was it just meant it blew my mind [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3256.94s)]
*  It just meant it blew my mind it was I was I was you know, very very proud [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3261.8999999999996s)]
*  Amazing and by the way [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3268.9799999999996s)]
*  It was also added that Mar showed up with a list of terrible things that Trump had said about Mar [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3270.22s)]
*  And he showed it I guess to President Trump who signed it and gave it back to [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3275.3399999999997s)]
*  Classic [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3283.06s)]
*  Anyway, yeah. So what do you make of it? Because the left is very unhappy with bill for doing this [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3284.74s)]
*  I don't know that the right is loving it either [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3290.46s)]
*  But I think they're used to Trump doing this now because he's had a parade of liberals come to him from big tech people to media [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3292.46s)]
*  People so what's your take on it? [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3298.14s)]
*  Well, I have some experience with this not necessarily meeting with Donald Trump, of course [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3300.38s)]
*  But you know the culture where you're not supposed to talk to the other side at all [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3304.94s)]
*  I mean, I've lost friends for my willingness to come on shows like this one because I think it's important to have these conversations [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3310.42s)]
*  I do think that there are areas of common ground. It doesn't mean you need to be a Trump supporter [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3318.06s)]
*  But Trump is the president of the United States meaning he's meant to represent everyone including individuals [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3323.3s)]
*  Who did not vote for him? [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3329.66s)]
*  And if the left in general is unwilling to even have a conversation with anyone on the right including the president [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3330.9s)]
*  Well, how are you ever gonna expect him to consider? [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3338.02s)]
*  The issues that matter the most to you [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3341.9s)]
*  So I actually think [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3344.38s)]
*  Opening up dialogue with individuals you disagree with is more important than just existing in this echo chamber [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3346.02s)]
*  Where you're gonna hear everything you want to hear where your ideas are gonna be validated and quite frankly [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3352.62s)]
*  Where the lack of challenge to your ideas will make you quite weak and unappealing eventually to the electorate [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3358.58s)]
*  Do you think is I know I know Bill loosely I've been on the show many times [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3366.6600000000003s)]
*  I really do think he can't stand president Trump. I mean, he truly has got like a [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3372.02s)]
*  sincere case of the TDS [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3378.54s)]
*  But he did this which was extraordinary. So do you think there's any chance he comes out? [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3380.58s)]
*  liking Trump [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3386.46s)]
*  Knowing Bill Maher's values it's unlikely [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3389.9s)]
*  I do think that they have some common ground because of the fact that Bill Maher is willing to call out some of the [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3393.02s)]
*  Pathologies on the left some of the culture [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3399.14s)]
*  Cultural issues on the left the closed mindedness and stuff like that [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3402.2599999999998s)]
*  So I think that finding that common ground is important [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3405.18s)]
*  And I think that's what kind of opened up this situation where they can sit down and have a conversation with each other [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3408.78s)]
*  But that doesn't necessarily mean that Bill Maher is gonna be like a red hat wearing Trump supporter tomorrow [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3413.38s)]
*  It just means that at least he had a dialogue [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3418.38s)]
*  Maybe he's better. He's better suited to understand where Trump is coming from and vice versa [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3421.74s)]
*  It's just an important thing to do when you have two major public figures who disagree with each other come together [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3427.7s)]
*  And I think what Kid Rock said about the importance of healing the country is very much true again [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3433.8999999999996s)]
*  You have two very different sides [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3439.8599999999997s)]
*  But is there a way that the two different sides can work together where they have common ground and also not engage in this really disgusting [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3441.7799999999997s)]
*  fear-mongering and dehumanization that we've seen in this country for the last several decades in regard to the other side [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3449.54s)]
*  We need to get past that because we need to bring Americans together [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3455.56s)]
*  I hate the fact that we've been dehumanizing each other for so long. I [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3459.36s)]
*  I'll tell you a funny story of how I met Kid Rock. It was 15 years ago [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3463.88s)]
*  I was hosting an afternoon show on Fox [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3468.68s)]
*  called America live and [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3472.04s)]
*  I would go through the show email while on the air [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3474.08s)]
*  Like during the commercial breaks and the audience would write in and you kept it interactive and an email popped up [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3477.72s)]
*  Saying it was from Kid Rock and that he was in town in New York that night for his birthday and was wondering if Doug [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3483.6s)]
*  My husband and I could come and it said where the party was and it just had the ring of truth because it was [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3490.48s)]
*  Specific and had Doug's name, but but I was also like this has got to be bullshit [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3497.04s)]
*  So I forwarded it to my booker and I was like, can you see if this is real? [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3501.64s)]
*  Because I actually am a fan of Kid Rocks and so she got back to me and said it's real [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3505.04s)]
*  So that night Doug and I went to this little bar that Kid Rock was having his birthday party in we walked in [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3509.28s)]
*  He was sitting there. He looked at me. He goes [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3516.84s)]
*  Holy shit, it worked [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3518.96s)]
*  And we became friends are ever after so I really like him a lot and he's this and he's gone, you know [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3522.56s)]
*  He's very pro Trump now and he's MAGA, but he really was a political independent who was very open-minded [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3528.12s)]
*  I would put him closer to like a Joe Rogan who was [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3533.4s)]
*  Maybe a lot in a lot of ways more blue in his politics [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3536.4s)]
*  But then we all lost our love and minds as a culture and he's Kid Rock for God's sake [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3539.44s)]
*  I mean there was there's zero chance that he is gonna go woke and that among other issues [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3544.2400000000002s)]
*  I think drove him into the arms of Donald Trump and MAGA [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3549.32s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look I think that there are a few different things happening simultaneously [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3553.28s)]
*  And I I definitely played a role in it [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3557.92s)]
*  And then once I realized how toxic it was I tried to kind of reform the way that [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3561.3599999999997s)]
*  You know the majority of people on the left think about engaging in dialogue [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3565.7999999999997s)]
*  so if you want to have any [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3570.3599999999997s)]
*  Influence or sway over people in positions of power whether it be a member of the media whether it be a [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3574.2s)]
*  politician or even the president of the United States [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3581.08s)]
*  You can't just close yourself off to talking to the other side, right? [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3583.7999999999997s)]
*  And if you do then you're not gonna have any influence you're gonna be part of your cutesy little exclusive club [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3588.12s)]
*  Where you engage in purity contests and you purge people away or purge people out of your group [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3593.2400000000002s)]
*  Whereas I don't know maybe I'm wrong about this and I'm gonna ask you I [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3599.48s)]
*  Feel that the right wing whether they're doing it because of who they are [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3603.16s)]
*  They're their own personal culture and how they value conversations or whether they're doing it as a you know way of accumulating power [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3607.36s)]
*  They bring people in even if there are some significant disagreements if there are areas where they can find [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3614.56s)]
*  commonality or agreement with the other side, they're super welcoming and inviting and [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3622.16s)]
*  That's how you build power. That's how you build power. I mean you bring people and push people out [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3627.52s)]
*  I totally agree with that and I do think there's a reason for it [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3632.64s)]
*  I think it's because people who are on the right spend their whole lives dealing with people who disagree with them [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3635.32s)]
*  You know, that's just society while it's split, you know [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3639.2799999999997s)]
*  50-50 or 55-45 depending on that the era [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3642.8199999999997s)]
*  Dem and Republican and now that Republicans have the edge these days, but overall liberals control the institutions [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3645.74s)]
*  You know, they've controlled the media for a long time. They control Hollywood. They control big sports. They control big corporations [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3652.8199999999997s)]
*  So if you're a conservative or even just center-right like you have to deal with them everywhere and Kate [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3658.8199999999997s)]
*  They're 12 not to mention college education by God [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3664.8999999999996s)]
*  Everyone everyone's liberal and they want you to be too [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3667.48s)]
*  so you either need to like be able to talk the talk or be able to politely engage and [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3670.0s)]
*  as I always say not make that the stakes of your friendship if you're talking about actual friends, you know because [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3675.4s)]
*  In where I grew up you'd have no friends [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3682.1600000000003s)]
*  If you if you only waited for conservatives to come into your life, right? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3684.28s)]
*  Like I was living on the upper West Side of Manhattan for the past 17 years [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3687.4s)]
*  I wouldn't have a single friend if I waited for it to be all conservatives [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3690.96s)]
*  And I didn't really want to hang out with my Fox people because while they were fine at work, you know [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3694.2799999999997s)]
*  It's like you don't want to fill your social life with media people [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3698.3199999999997s)]
*  That's a you know, that doesn't that's not where anybody wants to go. So yeah, I think you're absolutely right, but it's disheartening [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3700.44s)]
*  It's disheartening because you know recently I lost a friendship over politics. I mean at this point in my life [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3706.2799999999997s)]
*  I thought we'd be past that but as I've gotten more pro-maga [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3710.7599999999998s)]
*  That's been like a deal breaker for some of my leftist friends. I [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3714.8799999999997s)]
*  Mean, I'm not even pro-maga [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3719.3199999999997s)]
*  I'm just someone who's willing to have these types of conversations and I've lost friends over that, you know [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3720.96s)]
*  My core values haven't changed but I also realized that on some issues [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3727.06s)]
*  I didn't have all the information and I changed my mind based on additional information [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3731.96s)]
*  I was exposed to but you know the [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3736.96s)]
*  cultish treatment of politics [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3740.2400000000002s)]
*  I think has been really really toxic for this country and [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3742.3s)]
*  If you're already at a point where you're automatically dehumanizing the other side or a member of the other side [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3746.1600000000003s)]
*  You've gone way way too far and you're actually taking part in what's ripping the country apart [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3752.04s)]
*  So I'm not a kid rock fan. I want to be clear about that [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3758.1600000000003s)]
*  But the fact that he out of all these people [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3761.2400000000002s)]
*  Out of all these people was able to set up a meeting between Bill Maher and Donald Trump is admirable [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3765.5600000000004s)]
*  So I'm glad that Bill Maher did it [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3771.32s)]
*  I hope that he doesn't get too much backlash because I don't see him as someone who's gonna you know [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3773.08s)]
*  Go out and start cheerleading the Trump administration, but I don't either he's leading by example having these conversations is important [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3778.2s)]
*  Yeah, and Trump's ripped on him too. I mean it's been a mutual [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3785.56s)]
*  Non admiration society. So perhaps he'll be a thaw [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3788.92s)]
*  He is to his credit Bill Maher is a comedian who still wants to be funny, you know [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3792.48s)]
*  He does his monologue every week. He rips on both sides. He's genuinely looking to make people laugh and he's really good at it [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3796.0s)]
*  Okay, so do we take this over into the field of romance though, you know the our general mutual philosophy of [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3802.04s)]
*  Don't rule out somebody as a friend or somebody you'd speak to because of their politics because there's this viral video [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3808.88s)]
*  I'm sure you saw it going around on the internet [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3815.8s)]
*  I saw it on X but I'm sure it's on instant tick tock and all of them of this liberal woman [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3817.44s)]
*  Who says she broke up with her boyfriend over politics and this has engendered so many strong [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3822.4s)]
*  Feelings in the comments section wherever it gets posted. Here's a bit of it in South 38 [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3830.08s)]
*  So I am obviously like very much everyone knows that I'm a liberal woman [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3836.36s)]
*  My brother's gay all my friends are gay also like abortion rights, huh? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3841.36s)]
*  Female rights, but anyways, so I would like always ask him. I'd be like what like what's what's your politics? [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3844.4s)]
*  Like what do you who do you where do you lean and he was just like well like socially? [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3851.04s)]
*  I'm a liberal but economically I'm a Republican [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3856.16s)]
*  Fuck that. Okay. Fuck this. This is my last straw again. I'm a very liberal woman [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3860.2s)]
*  I have to date someone that is on the same page as me because I can't disagree with someone on [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3865.3599999999997s)]
*  Something that is so important to me for the rest of my life. I [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3870.56s)]
*  Fully respect Republicans. I understand that you want to vote that way, but for me, I don't want to marry you and I don't want to date [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3874.04s)]
*  you so [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3879.88s)]
*  we ended it and [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3881.2s)]
*  No regrets I've been single ever since it was awesome. It's been awesome [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3884.16s)]
*  Like virtually every man I follow an ex he had the same response dodged a bullet there man [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3888.7999999999997s)]
*  Congrats. Can I just before we get to the substance of I won't date a guy who doesn't show my politics [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3895.08s)]
*  She's extremely unlikeable. She's caustic. She's smug [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3900.64s)]
*  She's she said there's an arrogance to her like it's my way of the highway. I know better [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3904.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean you're disgusting because you don't agree with me politically like there's a disdain [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3909.4399999999996s)]
*  Even though you know half the country disagrees with her politically a lot of really good beautiful people disagree with her politically [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3913.3599999999997s)]
*  Why why is that [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3920.64s)]
*  Associated so often with these liberal women who do these posts on on social media [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3923.56s)]
*  Well, I have seen a lot of posts like that [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3930.48s)]
*  But look, I'm just gonna say she seems to know herself and what she wants really well and she's going for it [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3932.56s)]
*  So go for it, you know, I actually don't have any ill feelings toward her at all because she's determined [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3939.92s)]
*  I'm unwilling to move even an inch on on my politics [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3946.64s)]
*  But I do agree that she might be closing herself off to individuals that would be wonderful for her including her now ex-boyfriend [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3951.4s)]
*  Because people change people grow and they shift their positions on issues here and there [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3958.12s)]
*  I think it's wrong to think that you know, someone's political identity can't be fluid. I think it's fluid to some extent [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3964.88s)]
*  What I find really interesting is that he agreed with her on social issues and the agreement on social issues [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3972.04s)]
*  It's what's really likely to lead to a smoother relationship [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3978.8s)]
*  You know if he's more fiscally conservative, I don't think that's necessarily something that should be a deal-breaker [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3983.48s)]
*  I'll tell you something though. I'll tell you something right now, Anna. He didn't agree with her on social issues [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3990.0s)]
*  It was a lie. Probably if he's fiscally conservative [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3993.96s)]
*  He's not in today's social environment. Maybe like the social environment of 15 years ago where the big thing was like gay marriage [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=3996.68s)]
*  Yeah, you know, you could be like a pro-choice pro gay marriage [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4003.3599999999997s)]
*  Republican like a Rudy Giuliani, but there is zero chance in today's day and age somebody who says they're fiscally conservative is actually socially liberal, too [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4007.04s)]
*  I don't believe it. So she was right that they had vast differences [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4013.92s)]
*  I just find her so just got like dis disdainful and unlikable and [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4016.4s)]
*  Women like that are giving like my liberal friends a bad name because she's so nasty [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4021.44s)]
*  And seems to be like playing fast and loose with this guy's feelings like he's a nothing to her just because he has different [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4026.1200000000003s)]
*  Politics. All right one more for you on the on the culture front and this is another woman [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4032.84s)]
*  And this is gonna this is gonna take us to a place that I've really been this guy dying to discuss [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4037.8s)]
*  this is a woman named Paige Connell, she's a tick-tock mom influencer and [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4041.36s)]
*  She decided to post a very long. I watched five. I gave his woman five minutes of my life, which I'll never get back [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4045.96s)]
*  It was all about how? [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4050.92s)]
*  She's working mom her husband works too. They have kids [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4053.12s)]
*  she's very very unsatisfied with the amount or was of housework and support he was bringing to the home and [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4056.1600000000003s)]
*  She really had to lecture him into doing more and then was extremely disappointed when he did not live up to like her expectations [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4063.28s)]
*  Let me play what we have of it South 39 my husband and I had four kids we both worked full-time [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4071.42s)]
*  We had been together for 16 years at this point and on paper [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4076.58s)]
*  I have an amazing husband [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4080.18s)]
*  But I was incredibly frustrated and burnt out from our marriage and from motherhood and when we have kids [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4081.7s)]
*  Women tend to carry a disproportionate amount of the work in the home the work of raising kids and the mental load and about [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4088.2999999999997s)]
*  Three months after my fourth baby was born. I remember looking at my husband and saying I need more [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4095.06s)]
*  I need you to do more and I said, okay [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4100.7s)]
*  You know something that would make my life easier is [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4102.98s)]
*  If in the mornings when I came downstairs with the four kids because I do mornings by myself [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4105.58s)]
*  The dishwasher was emptied the dishes were put away and the trash was taken out [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4109.5599999999995s)]
*  And so of course he does it but then I have to remind him and then he forgets felt so [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4113.86s)]
*  disrespected and unseen and [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4120.099999999999s)]
*  Unvalued at that point in time. So we did the work to figure out what equity looked like in our relationship [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4123.42s)]
*  It can hurt your relationship it can ruin your marriage if you do not participate in an equitable way in your home [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4128.44s)]
*  Here's the thing that most men I follow on Twitter are responding to on X. They're they're [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4134.5199999999995s)]
*  offended that a wife would post a [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4140.44s)]
*  Dis video about her husband on the internet in any way shape or form [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4143.919999999999s)]
*  Yeah, look I have I have a broader point to make about that culture and it goes well beyond [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4151.12s)]
*  Wives posting about their husbands, please stop airing your dirty laundry on social media [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4156.92s)]
*  Honestly have a little bit of respect a modicum of respect for the people in your personal life [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4163.320000000001s)]
*  Even if you're in the middle of a feud with them, how about respect their privacy and work it out? [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4168.64s)]
*  Privately, you don't need a bunch of random strangers chiming in on your relationship [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4174.280000000001s)]
*  I would never in a million years do that to my husband or my friends or to my colleagues [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4178.88s)]
*  Which has been done to me many many times I think it's disgusting it shows a lack of maturity [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4183.28s)]
*  Have the conversation privately work out your own drama and your own issues privately. So that's point number one [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4188.56s)]
*  Point number two is look a marriage as I'm sure you know is [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4195.04s)]
*  It's a partnership and I think when you fail to see it as a partnership and you instead kind of like tally who's doing what? [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4200.36s)]
*  And whether or not you're you know, pulling your weight or he's pulling his weight [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4207.2s)]
*  That's just a toxic environment to function in to have a relationship in and so I [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4210.639999999999s)]
*  Learned that lesson pretty early on in my marriage. I remember in the very beginning. It was like, okay, he's got his bank account [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4216.639999999999s)]
*  I've got my bank account and he's gonna pay these bills [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4222.08s)]
*  I'm gonna pay those bills for some marriages that works out [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4224.5599999999995s)]
*  But I remember, you know Jenke Uygur my co-host and the founder of the Young Turks [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4227.28s)]
*  He kind of pulled me aside and said you're kind of paving a path to a lot of conflict here [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4232.04s)]
*  You have to see your marriage as a partnership and don't think of it as his money versus my money and honestly that was the best [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4238.2s)]
*  Advice I ever got in my marriage and we do really well together and I don't you know, he's not keeping track of whether I'm pulling [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4245.28s)]
*  My weight. I'm not keeping track of whether he's pulling his weight [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4251.96s)]
*  We have mutual love and mutual respect for each other and we look out for each other. That's what that's in my opinion a successful marriage [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4254.24s)]
*  It reminds me of not not your particular example [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4260.72s)]
*  But you know remember the Joy Luck Club the Joy Luck Club where one of the four women [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4264.16s)]
*  It's all about these four moms and then their next gen coming up and the lives that all eight women are leading and [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4270.32s)]
*  The one daughter of the mom is in a marriage where the guy like makes her write down [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4277.5599999999995s)]
*  If she ate that the tub of ice cream that was in the freezer [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4283.32s)]
*  Is it's gonna come off of her share of the grocery money, you know, she ate the ice cream and that's four dollars [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4288.5199999999995s)]
*  That she now owes it was so I mean it's abusive really is what it is. It's it's abusive [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4294.28s)]
*  But I do think there's something happening with men and women in you know on the conservative side of the aisle. That's a [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4299.12s)]
*  little upsetting to me right now and that is like as as we have bent over backwards as [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4306.8s)]
*  Conservatives or you know right-leaning people to make clear to women that they don't have to quote have it all that like if they don't [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4314.599999999999s)]
*  Want to work outside of the home and they want to be stayed home wives or stay home moms to like doing it all [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4321.36s)]
*  That's a totally amazing choice and no one should look down on it [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4328.84s)]
*  It's the most important job in the world is literally the most important job of the world to become to be a mother and to [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4333.44s)]
*  raise good children [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4337.08s)]
*  But like so many things we overcorrect we do it on the right the left does it too and [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4339.16s)]
*  what's happening right now on the right to some extent is it's it's morphing into and [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4344.88s)]
*  There's something wrong with somebody who works and the women who work are less attractive and not good partners and [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4349.92s)]
*  Also if you choose to work in like your 20s and your 30s and spend a lot of time at the office [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4358.0s)]
*  You're effing up your whole life. You're not gonna meet a man, and you're not gonna have a kid even though [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4364.5199999999995s)]
*  That's not necessarily true [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4370.92s)]
*  It's much easier to meet somebody and have a baby in your 20s because you're young and you got your totally golden eggs [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4372.5599999999995s)]
*  But so many women have kids in their 30s [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4379.280000000001s)]
*  I mean with without fertility help and and we've just sort of gotten to this place on the right [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4382.88s)]
*  Where then the messaging to me is like it's making me really uncomfortable. What do you make of it? [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4387.76s)]
*  Well, it's always made me uncomfortable [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4394.360000000001s)]
*  Especially because I think the best possible situation is the situation in which women get to decide right? [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4396.64s)]
*  So if they decide they want to be stayed home mothers [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4403.72s)]
*  I think it's important to have the economic conditions that allow for that to happen and I have a lot of respect for stay-at-home moms [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4406.0s)]
*  I agree with you. I think that's literally the most difficult job in the world and [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4412.94s)]
*  It's important for kids to have that close relationship with their mother growing up, especially in like the formative years [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4417.4800000000005s)]
*  But I do think that it's possible for mothers to work and still be great mothers [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4423.84s)]
*  The thing is a lot of women don't even have that choice you get what I'm saying [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4430.2s)]
*  Especially as for an economy with inflation, so I would love to live in a world where I could be a stay-at-home, you know housewife [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4434.92s)]
*  It's just not realistic, you know, we got to pay our bills and we both have to work [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4443.0s)]
*  But I really do think if we had that economic situation in place a lot of women would choose to be stay-at-home mothers [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4447.12s)]
*  And it should be their choice. I don't think it's anyone's place to judge [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4453.94s)]
*  The decisions that are made by any family, right? [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4458.56s)]
*  It's up to that family to decide what works best for them and whether or not they could afford the setup that they want to pursue [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4461.96s)]
*  But here's what's happening on the right? [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4467.96s)]
*  young women I talked to young conservative women all the time about their lives and their goals and you know the things that they want and [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4470.400000000001s)]
*  What's happening is [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4476.56s)]
*  They can't find [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4478.6s)]
*  Men who are maybe more conservative. Usually they're looking for somebody who is [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4480.68s)]
*  Religious, you know, like they're a lot of conservative women tend to be God God-loving conservatives and [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4485.96s)]
*  They can't find a lot of young men who want to marry a working woman now [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4493.759999999999s)]
*  This is an actual that's coming up on the right and to me [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4498.48s)]
*  It's so sad because it's like how do we get to the point where we were now telling young conservative? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4502.24s)]
*  amazing women [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4509.5199999999995s)]
*  They're not attractive if they also work if they choose to let's say do what I'm doing and what you're doing and like get [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4511.76s)]
*  Their voice out there, but I'll stick with me just because I think conservatives listening to this will like the thought of another [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4518.6s)]
*  Megyn Kelly voice up and coming [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4524.28s)]
*  Well, why wouldn't we want that? [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4526.92s)]
*  Why would we take somebody who's talented in this field and really wants to make a difference and have the messaging to her be? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4529.04s)]
*  You're really not that valuable unless you give it up and go into the home and only have a family and only raise a family [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4535.679999999999s)]
*  And though and not only we're sending her that message but young men are actually believing that they are they're actually believing especially on the right [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4542.8s)]
*  Because like the trad mom has gotten so popular and it's like no if we do that. We're not gonna have any strong [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4550.32s)]
*  conservative or right-leaning women to provide a role model for younger [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4557.32s)]
*  conservative women who [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4562.92s)]
*  There's nothing to apologize for here [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4565.24s)]
*  Don't necessarily want to spend all their 20s in their 30s [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4568.44s)]
*  Getting married and having kids or can't they just weren't able to meet somebody and definitely don't need to be shamed over it [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4572.24s)]
*  Yeah, I mean look I totally agree with you [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4579.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm I'm of two minds of this though because if you are a young man and you know what you want and you think [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4581.719999999999s)]
*  You have the earning power to literally carry the entire family financially [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4588.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, then I guess wait around until you find the right woman for you [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4593.28s)]
*  But I think most women not all but most women even conservative women [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4597.42s)]
*  Think it's important to have some level of financial independence, right? [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4602.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean you never know if your marriage is going to go perfectly [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4606.92s)]
*  Well, things could fall apart and if you haven't been in the job market at all for a long time [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4610.400000000001s)]
*  It's gonna be difficult for you to get back in [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4616.400000000001s)]
*  So look it really depends on the the guy and if he really has a problem with his wife working well then [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4618.5599999999995s)]
*  That's on him and I think he's actually gonna have some difficulty finding a partner [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4626.96s)]
*  But there's so many factors to consider including the financial difficulty of living in a single [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4631.28s)]
*  income household where you're trying to raise kids and [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4638.2s)]
*  Look, I also think whether these guys want to believe it or not when you have a stay-at-home wife [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4641.879999999999s)]
*  I've seen too many instances of this resentment building because [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4648.6s)]
*  For whatever reason guys tend to think that oh, well, she's staying home. She's not out there working as hard as I am [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4653.84s)]
*  She's just home raising the kids. She has a comfortable life [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4660.8s)]
*  I'm providing for her this like resentment starts to build and I've seen it all over the place [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4663.320000000001s)]
*  I've seen it in context like my own family. I've seen it, you know outside of my family. And so I think [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4668.56s)]
*  They don't really know what they're asking for here, but I could be wrong who knows and I agree with you [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4675.28s)]
*  I think that it is important to have [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4679.719999999999s)]
*  strong female voices on both sides of the political aisle and I think they could really be hurting the [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4682.04s)]
*  conservative movement by essentially [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4688.639999999999s)]
*  You know banning women from taking part in conservative media [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4691.12s)]
*  I mean you're one of the strongest conservative voices, you know female voices out there [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4695.16s)]
*  So if you didn't exist, I don't know. I just don't think the conservative message would be as powerful [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4699.48s)]
*  Well, thank you for that. I think they'd be fine [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4705.719999999999s)]
*  but I do think that there's a strain especially of young women who appreciate seeing a strong conservative woman who's [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4707.959999999999s)]
*  Who's had a who's had a voice in this lane and also had a family, you know [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4714.959999999999s)]
*  Like I know now you get shamed for saying that you can have it all but you can I'm sorry [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4718.959999999999s)]
*  I'll never say anything different you can [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4723.799999999999s)]
*  Yes, there are risks yes, you know if you if what's most important you is to have children and also [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4727.1s)]
*  Ideally to be with them even in your golden years and sadly, you know, I mean I had mine when I was older [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4733.38s)]
*  So that that clips the time that you'll be old with them and ideally grandchildren in your life [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4738.74s)]
*  But just didn't work out for me that way. I met my husband. I was 35. But anyway [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4744.06s)]
*  So if you really want to have kids when you're very young, yes, you may have to table career opportunities for a while [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4748.18s)]
*  But in my case, I just feel like it worked out [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4752.58s)]
*  Wonderfully and I all I want people to know is this too is a potential option for you [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4755.860000000001s)]
*  I do believe if you want it badly enough, you will make it happen. You will make your career happen [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4761.16s)]
*  You will make your amazing marriage happen. You will make your great kids happen, too [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4767.06s)]
*  Right. Look, I think that I remember you had put out some tweet and a lot of conservative women were like dogpiling on you [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4772.38s)]
*  and I think the [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4779.3s)]
*  reason why that happened is because [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4782.02s)]
*  There's always this statement about how women can have it all and I agree with you. I think women can be mothers [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4785.02s)]
*  I think they can raise a family and still have a career [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4790.660000000001s)]
*  But that message also needs to be followed up with the reality of how it is challenging and it's incredibly difficult, right? [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4793.540000000001s)]
*  It's not as easy as it is for a man and that's because of the gender dynamics at play [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4800.620000000001s)]
*  You know a woman women in general tend to be more nurturing [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4806.620000000001s)]
*  That's the evolutionary advantage that women have they're the ones who do the nurturing of the family of the children and so [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4810.62s)]
*  when you add a career on top of that that becomes very challenging and difficult and you I [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4817.78s)]
*  Can see women kind of pushing back because they're probably exhausted [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4824.459999999999s)]
*  They're probably raising a family while also juggling a career and I think they just want that validation [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4828.7s)]
*  They want that acknowledgement of how much more difficult it is to do that [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4834.419999999999s)]
*  But it is still possible to do that and have it all [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4838.22s)]
*  Totally you I I agree with everything you just said and I just my only point is like don't forget that [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4841.740000000001s)]
*  It's also possible to potentially have it all. I mean I'm living proof of it. And yes, people say you have money [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4848.54s)]
*  You're right. That's made a lot easier. How did I get the money? I earned it [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4854.22s)]
*  I earned every nickel of it myself and how did I do that? [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4857.4400000000005s)]
*  Busted my ass when I was in my 20s and 30s and [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4862.54s)]
*  Built a name and a career for myself [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4866.38s)]
*  I'm sorry [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4868.18s)]
*  But like I find it very disempowering to just tell all these women like you're really gonna have to choose [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4868.82s)]
*  Look, the reality is if what's your number one thing is to have kids having them earlier is better because fertility issues [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4874.7s)]
*  Would or could kick in? [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4882.22s)]
*  Later in your 30s. Sometimes women don't meet people early enough [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4884.7s)]
*  I've had so many young girls say to me and I might my viewers will email me and say I would love to have gotten married [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4888.22s)]
*  You before now I didn't meet anybody [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4893.9800000000005s)]
*  so I feel like conservative men need to stop shaming them because [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4895.9800000000005s)]
*  So many of them are trying and just aren't able to but I will say this [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4898.66s)]
*  the tweet that I sent out about you can you can make your own fortune you can get your own swanky New York City apartment and [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4903.1s)]
*  And also find somebody who wants to be with you on Valentine's Day and have children with you and stay with you was in response to [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4909.820000000001s)]
*  Ashley st. Claire the Elon alleged baby mama that was about her because that to me is not an okay choice [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4916.26s)]
*  You want to bang a billionaire and have his kid whatever that's between you and the billionaire [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4926.06s)]
*  But then you may not play the victim when he doesn't turn out to be Prince charming on [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4929.66s)]
*  Valentine's Day wanting to spend his day with you shock shock [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4934.3s)]
*  It's not actually a loving partnership, you know [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4938.06s)]
*  She clearly wanted to have his child and get on the Elon support program her earlier tweets make that clear so she did it [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4940.82s)]
*  That's it [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4948.66s)]
*  She got exactly what she bargained for and I don't feel sorry for her at all that he doesn't want to be a good boyfriend [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4949.4s)]
*  To her and may or may not be dicking her around. I mean he's claiming he's not but whatever that's my point. Yeah [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4954.0599999999995s)]
*  well, I actually have a question for you because [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4960.179999999999s)]
*  Look, I'm personally disgusted with the fact that he's like having all these children with different women [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4963.78s)]
*  And for a long time, you know, that was one of the areas where I agreed with conservatives, right? [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4971.099999999999s)]
*  Like conservatives would be pretty judgmental toward men that would act that way or behave that way now [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4975.9s)]
*  I see that very differently from someone who established a family [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4980.94s)]
*  But for whatever reason the marriage falls apart [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4984.9s)]
*  They unfortunately get a divorce and then later on in life he find someone else and has another family, right? [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4987.46s)]
*  I don't want to be too judgmental toward people like that life happens. It is what it is. But with Elon Musk [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4993.7s)]
*  It's like he's intentionally having children with different women. I [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=4999.46s)]
*  Don't think that's something to celebrate and I'm kind of shocked that conservatives haven't been more [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5004.38s)]
*  willing to kind of you know criticize him for that and I get by the way, I agree with you with Ashley St. Claire [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5010.66s)]
*  I yeah, what did you expect Ashley? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5017.360000000001s)]
*  And he had already had a bunch of children from different women prior to you having his child allegedly [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5019.780000000001s)]
*  You know, we don't know for sure the paternity and he's called it into question [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5024.86s)]
*  But I don't understand why it's okay to celebrate a guy who's this careless and irresponsible with bringing children into this world [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5028.9s)]
*  I don't even know it's carelessness [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5037.08s)]
*  I mean, I think it's in this case it may have been with Ashley St. Claire if indeed it's his child [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5038.66s)]
*  But with the other women it's like most of these are IVF babies [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5043.38s)]
*  At least the ones who have come in the past few years two women at the same time [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5048.5199999999995s)]
*  Impregnated if I'm not wrong with twins of Elan's via IVF. So very clearly an intentional choice by all [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5052.900000000001s)]
*  involved [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5060.580000000001s)]
*  So, you know like I I don't know what that's about if I ever get to interview Elon [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5062.46s)]
*  I maybe he'll tell me but I know he's like seriously committed [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5067.0s)]
*  ideologically to [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5071.660000000001s)]
*  Slowing population rates to he really had feels that there's a societal responsibility to repopulate and I know it's like the joke [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5073.820000000001s)]
*  Oh, he's doing his part, but I actually think that's what he's doing now [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5081.44s)]
*  Yeah, what happens to these babies who grew up without a father that very valid question [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5085.66s)]
*  I I don't know the answer to that and I don't think I like the answer to that [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5090.04s)]
*  I think the reason most people give Elon a pass is because [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5093.08s)]
*  He's just such a larger-than-life figure who's about just so much more than his personal life that it almost just gets shrunk [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5098.12s)]
*  It's like talking about like, you know Thomas Jefferson with his affair partner [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5105.96s)]
*  It's like we don't really care. He's Thomas Jefferson for the love of God [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5110.96s)]
*  Like some people are so much larger and doing so much good for society depending on your viewpoint [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5114.7s)]
*  That it's it just seems like minutiae [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5120.76s)]
*  It seems petty and small ball to pay attention to those things [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5123.84s)]
*  but wait, I want to say one other thing about Ashley St. Claire because she got back into the news on [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5127.4s)]
*  It was just the other day she was like trying to sell her Tesla because she's claiming she's a pauper now [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5133.36s)]
*  Here she is [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5139.22s)]
*  He's just not [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5170.22s)]
*  Not the only cleaning up after his messes after she posted that of her allegedly selling her Tesla he posted on X [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5189.38s)]
*  I don't know if the child's mine or not, but I am NOT against finding out no core order is needed [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5196.64s)]
*  Despite not knowing for sure. I've given Ashley 2.5 million and I'm sending her [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5202.360000000001s)]
*  $500,000 a year [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5209.320000000001s)]
*  Then she fired back we asked you to do a paternity test and you wouldn't but she doesn't she doesn't dispute [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5211.64s)]
*  Well, she says you weren't sending me money [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5216.4400000000005s)]
*  You were sending support for your child [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5218.92s)]
*  That you thought was unnecessary until you withdrew most of it to maintain control and punish me for quote disobedience [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5221.2s)]
*  But you're really only punishing your son. All right, so first of all [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5226.84s)]
*  2.5 million like she's not disputing. She got that she's saying, you know, you're my [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5231.6s)]
*  $500,000 a year, I guess he took some of it away [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5237.4400000000005s)]
*  How many women out there who get pregnant by a man? They're not married to get a check for 2.5 million [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5241.4800000000005s)]
*  She doesn't get it. Like that's that's what made me sent that post [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5246.72s)]
*  It's not about the post. My point is simply [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5250.92s)]
*  To a young woman who wants a fabulous New York apartment because she was bragging about how swanky it was to the New York Post [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5253.2s)]
*  You can do you can do that you you don't have to bang a billionaire and have a love child [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5259.04s)]
*  By the way, it's her second who she had out of wedlock before she turned 30 [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5266.64s)]
*  In order to pave your own path with gold, you know [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5272.0s)]
*  I said to Brit Hume when I was young and I divorced my first husband with whom I'm still friendly [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5276.28s)]
*  But he had just become an attending physician. I was married to him during med school and residency and internship [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5282.04s)]
*  We had no money and I said I'm the worst gold digger of all time and Brit Hume said to me forget that [[01:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5288.5s)]
*  Dig your own gold and that's really my message for her dig your own damn gold. It's so disempowering [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5295.96s)]
*  For people like this to think their path to the to the Golden Road is [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5302.76s)]
*  Screwing some rich guy and then hijacking him for millions [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5308.400000000001s)]
*  Totally, you know in [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5313.24s)]
*  Armenian there's a phrase it's called sock-otch and that means when you are eyeing other people's wealth [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5315.64s)]
*  When you're eyeing other people's hard-earned, you know income and when you're you want it for yourself [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5322.64s)]
*  You want to take it for yourself and so, you know growing up [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5328.92s)]
*  I just remember my parents really instilling in me don't look at other people's money. Don't look to take from others [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5331.400000000001s)]
*  Look toward the future and how you can build for yourself [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5340.2s)]
*  And I'm really really grateful that I had that upbringing because I love freedom [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5343.4400000000005s)]
*  Okay, and honestly in America in any capitalist society [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5348.92s)]
*  Freedom means you're able to earn your own living and you're not reliant on anyone else. You're not relying on your husband [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5353.96s)]
*  I let me be clear believe in a robust social safety net [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5360.8s)]
*  And I would like to make ours more robust here in the United States because sometimes things happen people lose their jobs [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5365.96s)]
*  They get laid off and they need a little bit of help [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5371.84s)]
*  However, you know being independent and not needing help from anyone is like the definition of freedom for me [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5374.52s)]
*  Because I get to make my own decisions [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5381.86s)]
*  I get to marry the man that I love without being worried about whether or not he has enough earning power [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5383.74s)]
*  And I think that's really the main reason why I'm in a happy marriage to be quite frank. Yeah [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5388.98s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's funny. I mean like I married my husband [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5394.58s)]
*  He was making a lot more money than I was at the time [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5397.06s)]
*  And then eventually that switch is because media is such a crazy industry [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5398.94s)]
*  But it's wonderful that we met and fell in love when the rules were reversed, you know [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5402.62s)]
*  Like I love that about us and neither one of us has to worry [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5407.58s)]
*  He doesn't have to worry that I'm a gold digger and and I don't have to worry that he's one, you know [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5410.66s)]
*  I mean, we're both we married each other because we fell in love. I was already a professional [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5416.14s)]
*  I was already on television and had been a lawyer in any event. I want [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5419.54s)]
*  Options for our young women. I want them to be able to make whatever choice they that works for them without getting ashamed [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5423.18s)]
*  But I also think it's important that there are options [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5428.98s)]
*  I was like in the same way the 1950s women couldn't find jobs because they weren't out there [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5432.44s)]
*  I don't want us to get to the point where young conservative women can't find husbands because they're not willing to look at a young [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5437.1s)]
*  Woman who actually does have a career. This is not a solution [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5443.46s)]
*  And let me just say one other thing, you know [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5446.700000000001s)]
*  There are some female conservatives that I listen to [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5448.780000000001s)]
*  Specifically because I want to be well-rounded and understand what you know people believe and where they're coming from on the opposite [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5453.26s)]
*  I side of the political spectrum, you know, Amber Duke is a good example [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5460.160000000001s)]
*  She's one of the hosts over at the Hill. I love her right? I don't agree with her on some things, but that's okay [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5464.1s)]
*  I'm way more willing to listen to what you have to say or what Amber Duke has to say as a [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5469.780000000001s)]
*  Woman on the left because your communication style is more inviting to people like me women on the left [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5476.780000000001s)]
*  so, you know, I think that the trad culture is really kind of hurting itself by [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5484.740000000001s)]

*  To folks on the left. So that's another thing to consider [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5505.48s)]

*  Love how they acted surprised. Oh, why did that happen? [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5764.9s)]
*  Why did that happen I have no idea he wrote on the bullets why it happened [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5768.9800000000005s)]

*  Why does alon musk dress like he just got out of a hot topic? [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5777.86s)]
*  I am so sick of that guy trying to rewrite his origin story [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5782.9s)]
*  Like he was Matthew McConaughey pulling into the high school. It's like you were a [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5787.86s)]
*  nerd nobody bangs you and now you have hair plugs [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5791.9400000000005s)]

*  Okay, this I like Jimmy Fallon he's a sweet guy I can speak to that personally but the over laughter in response to things that [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5801.7s)]
*  Aren't that funny is not a good way. That's a bad tick. Anyway, what do you make of bill burr? [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5807.7s)]
*  Suddenly, I guess what he doesn't want to talk politics anymore [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5812.82s)]
*  I found his jokes a little funny, but i'll say this [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5816.82s)]
*  He saw the new he saw the mike flag. It was the newsmax mike flag [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5820.18s)]
*  And he didn't want to give him anything. That's that's what that was [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5824.9800000000005s)]
*  He just didn't want to give them anything to to broadcast, you know, maybe he doesn't trust them [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5828.5s)]
*  Maybe he thinks they're going to take him out of context. Who knows but to me it was clear [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5834.5s)]
*  He didn't want to speak to conservative media [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5838.66s)]
*  We're back to the earlier point we were making there. You know, there are like [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5841.06s)]
*  Try try living, you know life in [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5845.46s)]
*  My shoes elon shoes, you know anybody named trump's shoes [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5848.42s)]
*  It's like that's all you get is it adversarial media with a mic in your face, right? It's like [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5851.38s)]
*  Why wouldn't you say that's isn't that who he needs to confuse or could convince right of his points? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5856.02s)]
*  Isn't that the group watching newsmax that he wants to get his message in front of more than anyone about luigi and what a sympathetic character he is [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5862.02s)]
*  I think there's this mistake made by a lot of folks on the left and and I want to be clear about how wrong they are. So [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5869.78s)]
*  I get that media representing the other side might be adversarial. They might ask you provocative questions [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5876.74s)]
*  But I actually think there's a lot of value speaking to them [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5885.46s)]
*  Not because you're trying to win the host over or the reporter over [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5888.82s)]
*  But because you are sharing your message and your beliefs with an entirely new audience that may not have heard the arguments that you are making [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5892.74s)]
*  It's not about the big public figures that you're talking to you're not going to win them over that's clear [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5902.099999999999s)]
*  But you are sharing a message with half the country that might not have otherwise heard that message [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5908.18s)]
*  So it's look do you want to persuade people or not? And if you're not interested in persuading people, that's fine [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5914.099999999999s)]
*  But I would venture to say that if you are in the public making political arguments [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5920.18s)]
*  The reason why you're doing it is to persuade people [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5925.3s)]
*  What's the point of just preaching to the choir? [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5928.98s)]
*  And just talking to people in your echo chamber. It's more effective to talk to people you disagree with [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5932.34s)]
*  this is one of the reasons why I just sat down with the new york times and [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5937.3s)]
*  This and the desire for votes is the reason kamala harris went on fox news with brett bear which was real [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5941.78s)]
*  We watched it with our own eyes. It didn't go particularly well, but I bring her up because [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5948.66s)]
*  I have to ask you about a report that just hit from [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5953.38s)]
*  Um courtesy of was it uh, let's say it's real clear investigations [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5956.02s)]
*  Yes, lee fong [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5960.82s)]
*  and uh [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5962.18s)]
*  He revealed that all those brett videos. We got how many do we have when would you show one? Here's a remix saw 24 [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5963.38s)]
*  My mother used to she would give us a hard time sometimes and she would say to us [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5970.26s)]
*  I don't know what's wrong with you young people [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5974.66s)]
*  You think you just fell out of a coconut tree? [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5977.06s)]
*  You exist in the context [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5981.62s)]
*  Of all in which you live and what came before you [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5985.46s)]
*  Just videos of her hysterical laughing and now dancing [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5992.82s)]
*  This is the rebranding of kamala harris. I love venn diagrams [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=5997.22s)]
*  Oh god, I really do. I love venn diagrams [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6002.18s)]
*  And what lee fong has found is that [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6008.18s)]
*  All of that was bought and paid for influencers who flooded the web with neon mat macha green pro harris videos [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6011.62s)]
*  synced to beats from singer charlie xcx's album brat last year [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6018.179999999999s)]
*  Were quietly funded quoting here by an elusive group of democrat billionaires and major donors in an arrangement designed to conceal the payments from voters [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6023.139999999999s)]
*  according to real clear investigations obtained [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6031.38s)]
*  Internal documents and whatsapp messages from democratic strategists behind the influencer campaign way to win [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6033.86s)]
*  One of the major donor groups behind the effort spent more than 9.1 million [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6040.099999999999s)]
*  On social media influencers during the 24 presidential election payments revealed here for the first time. It's amazing. I mean [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6044.66s)]
*  I'm not i'm not sure we thought it was organic [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6052.66s)]
*  But what we're learning more and more is that any piece of praise she got was either purchased or given under duress by people like barack obama [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6054.82s)]
*  Hmm well, you know, it's it's interesting because I do think both sides of the political aisle do this to some extent [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6063.94s)]
*  you know, it's it's an effort to kind of [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6070.58s)]
*  Make the candidate appear more popular than they really are and it has a bandwagon effect, right? [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6073.54s)]
*  Where some voters who might might not be as politically engaged will see this [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6078.98s)]
*  Manufactured popularity, but they won't know it's manufactured and they'll think well a lot of people like this guy or this gal [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6084.799999999999s)]
*  So i'm going to cast my ballot for that individual [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6090.18s)]
*  But I think things have changed in our political environment where people are a lot more engaged because there's a lot on the line [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6092.820000000001s)]
*  You know, they have a stake in the game whether it's the economy or something else [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6099.46s)]
*  I just think that the democrats being obsessed with that billionaire money is what has led to them being failures in the political system [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6103.620000000001s)]
*  They need to listen to the voters and ignore the billionaires [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6112.02s)]
*  And that's how they actually bolster their popularity as opposed to doing whatever it was that convolut was up to [[01:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6115.16s)]
*  I mean, it's really unclear. It reminds me of when I was in high school [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6121.4s)]
*  We had a high school sorority [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6124.92s)]
*  And you had to wear this very silly outfit for the whole scrub week [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6126.68s)]
*  Of like your pants rolled up above your knees and a white polo shirt just hanging and tube socks pulled up high [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6130.04s)]
*  And by the end of that week [[01:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6136.12s)]
*  Some gals like who were younger in high school who didn't know any better [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6138.44s)]
*  Started wearing that outfit because they actually thought it had caught on because all these girls were up [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6142.68s)]
*  That's what that's what people who spread the lie kamala is brat [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6147.64s)]
*  That's what happened to you. You bought the campaign as real hook line and sinker [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6151.56s)]
*  And now should feel somewhat embarrassed and go back to your normal tree torn sneakers and palmetto jeans with the stripes in the front [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6157.0s)]
*  And a pleasure again. I hope you'll come back [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ofzWqWVcpV4&t=6163.24s)]
