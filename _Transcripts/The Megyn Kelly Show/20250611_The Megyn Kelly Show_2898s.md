*  The New York Times and this PR agent who represented the couple [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=132.72s)]
*  sure, I'm first of all great to see you and [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=136.88s)]
*  Sorry to interrupt your your [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=140.32s)]
*  Your vacation we hope I hope you're having a great time [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=142.76s)]
*  so far so good last time I [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=146.55999999999997s)]
*  Thanks. The last time I was with you actually was the last kind of disaster in LA, which were the LA fires [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=148.72s)]
*  I think it's March [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=155.67999999999998s)]
*  seventh and and and we were we were on together or [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=157.56s)]
*  you know the second and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=161.92s)]
*  So, you know yet another you know crisis in LA and and I'm here [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=164.44s)]
*  So I don't think there's any coincidence [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=169.64s)]
*  But my take on what the judge did was the judge simplified things [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=172.39999999999998s)]
*  and you know while [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=177.32s)]
*  You know, we're not pleased that he got rid of the defamation causes of action [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=180.16s)]
*  You know, the truth was the case was never really about [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=184.44s)]
*  You know defamation and while it's in our [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=189.2s)]
*  While it's our response and it's while it's a portion of our claims [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=192.76s)]
*  You know from the very start this case was about somebody being wrongfully accused and that's Justin and [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=197.48000000000002s)]
*  and it's also been about Melissa and Nathan and her team at tag and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=204.56s)]
*  and about Jen Abel and and herself and and about her being wrongfully accused about a smear campaign and [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=209.12s)]
*  And the reality is you know when you you know, what I believe is going on is that the judge [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=217.08s)]
*  You know is getting through all of this and saying hey [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=223.04s)]
*  We're gonna parrot this down to really what the issues are in the case and I don't want collateral stuff going on [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=226.88s)]
*  I I just want you know answers to the key questions, right? Was there sexual harassment? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=233.16s)]
*  You know clearly no [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=238.64000000000001s)]
*  And you know was there a smear campaign and that's no also [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=240.84s)]
*  So that's what I really think when you pare it down the law and all of that to what the judge is trying to do here [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=245.2s)]
*  What do you make of the victory lap she and her lawyers are taking claiming absolute vindication? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=252.92000000000002s)]
*  Calling the counterclaims basically a sham saying the judge saw right through them and Blake lively out there thanking the 19 [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=258.6s)]
*  organizations who filed briefs on her behalf [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=267.12s)]
*  Right well, you know without getting into detail on that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=271.4s)]
*  I mean first of all the the judge made clear that he didn't read the briefs [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=274.32s)]
*  The judge made clear that he didn't rule on forty seven point one [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=278.0s)]
*  Which she's going around and and and celebrating a victory on what that is [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=282.91999999999996s)]
*  And forty seven one was the was the California statute that is a new statute that [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=288.84s)]
*  She took the position [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=296.47999999999996s)]
*  That you couldn't defend yourself by filing a claim against an accuser [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=298.52s)]
*  Concerning sexual harassment or sexual assault which you know in in most cases is a really important law [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=305.23999999999995s)]
*  In most cases is a really important conceptual case and it really protects the victims [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=312.84s)]
*  But you know you gotta ask yourself here. Who's the real victim? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=319.47999999999996s)]
*  The real victim is Justin and and the others and it's because they've been wrongfully accused and ask yourself [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=323.91999999999996s)]
*  You know when you've been in a situation where you've been wrongfully accused [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=330.88s)]
*  You know, how do you defend yourself? Are you allowed to defend yourself? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=335.59999999999997s)]
*  Are you allowed to lead with truth because that's all that's been done here is putting everything out in a website [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=339.64s)]
*  Putting everything out for the public not hiding anything and saying here it is [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=346.47999999999996s)]
*  Was there sexual harassment was there a smear campaign? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=351.68s)]
*  And forty seven point one seems to say this new California law if you're a an alleged sexual harassment or [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=356.64s)]
*  sexual assault or hostile work environment plaintiff and [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=364.2s)]
*  Somebody who you've accused comes back at you saying I didn't do it and what you're alleging is [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=368.56s)]
*  defamatory of me [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=376.32s)]
*  Thanks to this statute that person defending themselves saying I didn't and what you say is defamation [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=378.6s)]
*  Can get in a lot of trouble potentially could have to pay that person's legal fees if the counterclaim gets dismissed [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=384.52000000000004s)]
*  Could have to pay triple the legal fees potentially and punitive damages [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=391.72s)]
*  So the the California statute almost makes it like extremely dangerous for someone in Justin Baldoni's position [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=396.76s)]
*  To actually defend himself against a sexual harassment complaint [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=403.8s)]
*  Well, it's not dangerous if you know, you're right. So this case has always been about facts [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=409.12s)]
*  It hasn't been about victory laps. It hasn't been about Saturday Night Live tours. It hasn't been about the people 100 [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=415.16s)]
*  You know or the time 100, you know, it hasn't been about [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=422.4s)]
*  The show and it hasn't been about [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=427.64s)]
*  You know the misrepresentations [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=432.03999999999996s)]
*  It's been about the facts, you know, we've got we've been in this case for a while now [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=435.0s)]
*  You know, have we seen you know text messages? Have we seen evidence? Have we seen receipts? [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=440.06s)]
*  You know, you've only seen them from one side and and it's been out there and what we've seen from Blake Lively is her showing [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=446.58s)]
*  You know who she really is and and the truth is, you know that [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=455.06s)]
*  There's a famous quote that says when people show you who they are [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=459.97999999999996s)]
*  Believe them [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=465.53999999999996s)]
*  Mm-hmm Maya Angelo. Yeah, so what what did you make of the judge because you say it's clearly didn't read the briefs [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=467.26s)]
*  I have to say I was surprised at some of the sweeping language in there. For example him saying well [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=473.88s)]
*  Justin Baldoni you can't really sue him [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=480.44s)]
*  He can't sue Ryan Reynolds for defamation because when you sue a public figure when you are a public figure suing for defamation [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=483.36s)]
*  You have to meet the New York Times versus Sullivan standard showing that the person who defamed you did it with actual malice [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=491.64s)]
*  Meaning they knew it was false when they said it [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=497.44s)]
*  Saying false things to WME the agency that he got to break up with Justin [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=500.6s)]
*  So he knew the things were false or he behaved with reckless disregard for their falsity and the judge seemed to say [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=505.20000000000005s)]
*  Anything he heard was from his wife. So he couldn't have known it was false at worst case scenario [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=511.88s)]
*  He was mistaken and therefore your claims against Justin need to be dismissed though [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=517.48s)]
*  A couple of those have been granted leave to refile [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=522.4s)]
*  I I just don't understand that because there there is evidence that that Ryan Reynolds had direct interactions with [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=525.0799999999999s)]
*  Justin with Blake with Taylor Swift. I don't get that part brain [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=533.1999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, well, I you know [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=539.16s)]
*  I think it's a nuance in the law that that that you're aware of but you know public figures who sue for defamation [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=540.3s)]
*  Have to prove malice what the judge essentially said as you as you read the order is that? [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=546.92s)]
*  You know, there can be no malice here because the allegations arose from the CRD complaint [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=554.48s)]
*  Which is a protected [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=562.2s)]
*  You know document as a legally filed document [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=565.12s)]
*  The civil rights complaint that she filed to kick this whole thing off and then leaked to the New York Times clearly go ahead [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=568.84s)]
*  That's right. And and and we don't agree with that at all. We think there's so much collateral [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=574.0s)]
*  Action that happened here factually [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  That that is outside of the scope of that document itself [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=583.04s)]
*  You know, for example, the New York Times said, you know that they reviewed thousands of text messages [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=587.36s)]
*  And made their own determination based on that. They had a video that they put together [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=594.08s)]
*  These things are not directly taken from the CRD complaint [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=599.28s)]
*  And and you know and and the court, you know address that in its own way [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=603.8000000000001s)]
*  And and you know that the court, you know, the court was very [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=608.12s)]
*  Matter of fact about that. I don't think the the you know, generally [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=612.5200000000001s)]
*  Judges or courts like when media is sued. They certainly don't like when you know public figures [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=616.44s)]
*  Sue for defamation [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=623.5200000000001s)]
*  The standard is higher. It does require malice [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=625.5200000000001s)]
*  I think in this case, there's a lot of arguments on why there is malice [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=628.84s)]
*  But but again, I get back to why are we here? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=632.6s)]
*  And what are we really you know proving here and the truth is it's two things [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=635.68s)]
*  It's it's did he sexually harass her and and is you know, was there a smear campaign and and again, you know [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=641.36s)]
*  We can it's it's it's a bummer [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=648.1999999999999s)]
*  And and you know, and I feel really upset about the fact that you know [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=650.92s)]
*  Compensation in the form of damages as a result of defamation is not possible at the moment [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=656.8s)]
*  I'm sure you know, they will both say things in the future that will bring this back to life. I have no doubt, right? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=662.8s)]
*  Can I ask you about about you mentioned 47.1 this law in California that kind of protects [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=670.0s)]
*  Someone even alleging sexual harassment from getting sued for defamation [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=676.4799999999999s)]
*  In other words, if the defamation case is dismissed, it gives them potentially triple [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=680.52s)]
*  Their attorneys fees and costs of defamation [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=686.28s)]
*  Their attorneys fees and costs that could be [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=690.2s)]
*  millions and millions of dollars if the judge says it applies and [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=695.0s)]
*  Justin has to pay before we ever even get to discovery in this case Brian [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=700.0s)]
*  Does he have that kind of money and what are the odds that the judge is going to impose that hefty of penalty on him? [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=704.28s)]
*  Well, you know, I'm not at liberty to talk about his finances [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=712.8000000000001s)]
*  But suffice it to say that that I doubt many people have that kind of money [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=716.76s)]
*  but you know, but I think the [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  You know the distinction in this case is is that? [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=725.0400000000001s)]
*  Sometimes the law [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=729.08s)]
*  Does not you know take into account morality and you know while this particular [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=731.6s)]
*  Statute is is a good statute in in cases where it's important and it matters and where there's [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=739.96s)]
*  someone who's bullying the victim and and I want to take that really seriously because I think it's really important and Justin feels [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=746.72s)]
*  It's really important but where it doesn't apply [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=754.28s)]
*  Is a case where somebody has created allegations that do not rise to the level of [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=757.96s)]
*  sexual harassment and and we now know exactly what those [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=765.8000000000001s)]
*  Allegations are we you know, we have a specific understanding of what those allegations are we've seen video that shows [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=771.3s)]
*  Exactly what happened in the scene that that she said was so inappropriate [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=779.8199999999999s)]
*  And and we've seen, you know the text messages about coming to my trailer [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=785.02s)]
*  We've seen the evidence that directly refutes the allegations of sexual harassment [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=789.9799999999999s)]
*  So in this case, you know from our perspective there's not nearly the risk that [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=796.58s)]
*  That there would be in a case where it was used for bullying in this case. It's truly about [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=801.74s)]
*  Trying to prove that you didn't sexually harass someone and why with his career destroyed at the moment [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=808.9s)]
*  Why is he not allowed that right to defend himself and to be able to say this is not okay? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=815.9s)]
*  Does the judge get to take any of that into account? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=822.2s)]
*  Because she's moving she's her team has made clear [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=825.8000000000001s)]
*  they're gonna move to get all of her fees behind this motion to dismiss recovered from Justin and [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=828.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm sure they're gonna ask for them to be troubled or tripled and [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=833.24s)]
*  Possibly punitive damages, which just seems insane to me. But will the judge be able to [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=837.44s)]
*  Consider what we know to be the evidence in the case just from all you've done even [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=842.5200000000001s)]
*  Prediscovery to put together what really happened here [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=847.5600000000001s)]
*  Does he get to even consider any of that or do you actually think there's a real shot Justin could be on the hook for? [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=850.04s)]
*  this woman's attorneys fees times three [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=854.14s)]
*  Well, I think the judge has to look at this statute, which is a brand new statute [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=856.96s)]
*  Which there's absolutely no case long which hasn't been challenged at all [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=861.52s)]
*  And and the judges is is either going to or not going to make a determination [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=866.5600000000001s)]
*  As to whether it applied or not so far in the ruling the judge specifically said that he did not take that statute into consideration [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=872.1600000000001s)]
*  But he did, you know welcome the the parties to file [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=879.6s)]
*  You know briefs on on trying to recover their attorneys fees including using forty seven point one [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=883.48s)]
*  As an as an argument, I believe because the ruling wasn't a part of that and the judge didn't rule on it [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=889.4s)]
*  It's moot and it doesn't apply [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=896.1600000000001s)]
*  But you know, there's a you know, there's a chance that the judge could consider that I think it's also a statute [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=899.48s)]
*  That's completely untested and we have to ask ourselves [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=905.1999999999999s)]
*  You know where there are good laws that help to protect good people [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=908.72s)]
*  When does it go too far that your constitutional rights are taken away? [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=912.84s)]
*  And when does it go too far that they're taken away in in a way that that punishes you? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=916.88s)]
*  So severely for trying to defend yourself and saying this is not okay and this defames me [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=923.8s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=930.3199999999999s)]
*  Can you just speak to what you think her strategy was here? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=931.4399999999999s)]
*  I mean was it I'll file this Civil Rights Division complaint and then my allegations will be protected [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=934.6s)]
*  undermining any attempt to sue me for potentially defamatory statements and [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=942.68s)]
*  Then I will leak it to the New York Times [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=947.8s)]
*  So it will get out there and then everyone will know that I'm the victim here as opposed to [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=949.92s)]
*  the narrative that existed prior to her filing that complaint which was [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=956.64s)]
*  She seems like a real bitch and she is tone-deaf on domestic violence and she seems to have blown up her movie [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=961.72s)]
*  For no apparent reason those those were the buzz that was part of the buzz going around about her [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=968.68s)]
*  She bullies reporters that was also part of it [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=973.16s)]
*  So is is that your theory of the case Brian that she launched this whole thing in her own effort at [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=975.0s)]
*  PR spin and control I [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=981.72s)]
*  I believe what happened in the case and it's pretty clear right is that [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=984.48s)]
*  You know press came out which was negative toward her [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=990.08s)]
*  There was press that came out with that was negative toward Justin [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=993.92s)]
*  But but you know these you know, whether it's internet sleuths [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=996.38s)]
*  Who are amazing or whether it's you know amazing reporters went back in time and pulled videos and pulled [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1000.8000000000001s)]
*  You know information [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1008.0400000000001s)]
*  and you know [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1010.12s)]
*  Generally videos don't lie right about how you've behaved in the past and they pulled that information [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1011.88s)]
*  They put that information out whether it was the Christy flaw [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1017.76s)]
*  You know video or whether it was other videos whether it was the videos where she said here's what I do [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1021.32s)]
*  I just you know [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1027.2s)]
*  misrepresent what I'm you know, I'm trying to get a role and then I take over the film and [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1028.6000000000001s)]
*  You know or any of that stuff? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1034.16s)]
*  I think that the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1036.16s)]
*  Reporters and other people in the media played that for people and people had a reaction to it and there was an organic [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1037.6000000000001s)]
*  Response as a result of that. I think that was too much for her [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1043.64s)]
*  It was too much for her to believe that somebody could actually not like her based on her own belief her own conduct [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1047.1200000000001s)]
*  I think that was something that that that she couldn't handle [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1054.2s)]
*  Whether that's a you know, whether that's an interesting narcissism quality or otherwise [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1058.3200000000002s)]
*  I don't know not a doctor but but I can tell you this the the [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1063.22s)]
*  Result of it was her scurrying around trying to blame someone [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1068.1200000000001s)]
*  else [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1073.76s)]
*  for why her own behavior seemed to be the cause of [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1074.92s)]
*  People not liking her and that's spiraled into something that you know is you know was completely out of control [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1080.0s)]
*  I mean whenever do you see someone you know make a red carpet walk and [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1086.96s)]
*  and go out in the press and bring all of their [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1093.48s)]
*  Friends into this and and make this situation bigger than what it is. Is this good for her? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1097.0s)]
*  Is this good for her career? Is this good for her children? Is this good for her family? [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1102.96s)]
*  You know, you have to ask yourself at some point everybody has a part in everything, right? [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1107.6s)]
*  Does she is she does she is she capable of taking responsibility for her part in this and owning that? [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1112.76s)]
*  That's we haven't seen that yet [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1120.68s)]
*  And that's why you know that that many people out there are finding evidence about how she's behaved how she's treated reporters [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1122.8799999999999s)]
*  How she's treated people how she's treated individuals how she's treated, you know waiting staff and and and others [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1130.08s)]
*  And saying it's not okay. We don't like you [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1136.64s)]
*  Mm-hmm. She's a bully. That's my own conclusion. She's an obvious bully who can't take any rounds of negative press, which is so absurd [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1140.92s)]
*  You and I both know that public figures [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1148.3600000000001s)]
*  many of whom you've defended [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1151.5600000000002s)]
*  including yours truly have to take tons of [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1153.6000000000001s)]
*  Negative press and it's just part of being a public figure. It's not pleasant but to [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1157.76s)]
*  Try to ruin a man's life over one mild round that she had to suffer when this movie came out is just insane [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1163.8000000000002s)]
*  That's to me clear clearly what she's doing [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1170.64s)]
*  Can I ask you about what remains because my own take was so the civil extortion claim is gone [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1173.4s)]
*  The defamation claim is gone the false light invasion of privacy claim counterclaims [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1178.76s)]
*  I should say by Justin against her and the related parties are gone [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1182.4s)]
*  But what's what's left because I heard you say it's four claims [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1185.88s)]
*  I thought it was just the torches interference and the breach of the covenant of good faith and fair dealing in so far as he's alleging [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1189.44s)]
*  that Ryan Reynolds [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1196.72s)]
*  Messed with his relationship with Ari Emanuel over at WME [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1198.76s)]
*  Like if if that happened and they interfered with Justin's agency relationship, you still have a claim. Where am I wrong? How is it bigger? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1202.6399999999999s)]
*  Well, it's bigger because there's an intentional interference with contract which is against Blake and Ryan [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1211.04s)]
*  That the judge gave us a roadmap to replete [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1217.08s)]
*  There's intentional interference with perspective [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1220.68s)]
*  Economic advantage and that's got goes beyond just a contract it goes to the heart of you know, are you going to be able to work again? [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1223.96s)]
*  there's negligent in [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1231.96s)]
*  Negligent interference with perspective economic advantage against Blake and Ryan and there's something called breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1234.4s)]
*  Dealing against Blake only and those claims, you know are being repled [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1242.42s)]
*  The judge gave again gave us a roadmap to to on how to replete those [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1248.0600000000002s)]
*  And what the judge would like to see we are doing that now [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1252.8600000000001s)]
*  and working through that and and those are significant claims but nothing as is as significant as [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1256.7800000000002s)]
*  Taking her deposition [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1265.22s)]
*  Going through that process getting the witness testimony and the witnesses deposed and going into the courtroom [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1267.78s)]
*  And showing the truth to show that there was no sexual harassment. Nothing is more important than that [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1275.1000000000001s)]
*  And you think that deposition could take place as early as when? [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1282.6200000000001s)]
*  It's been noticed in June [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1286.94s)]
*  we'll see, you know when she actually decides to appear and [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1289.34s)]
*  And, you know, but I assume that it will take place before August 15th because that's the close of [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1294.18s)]
*  discovery of that type [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1302.18s)]
*  Are you gonna get Ryan as well Ryan Reynolds? [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1303.98s)]
*  We'll see. I mean, you know, obviously he's defendant in the case [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1307.98s)]
*  so, of course, we're going to notice his deposition and you know, and the judge has clearly indicated that the judge would like to limit discovery [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1310.7s)]
*  And limit the you know the the collateral issues in the case [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1319.18s)]
*  We think there's really important issues that there needs to be discovery on and and those will be some of the battles along the way [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1324.26s)]
*  That we will have [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1332.26s)]
*  but you know, there's there's no substitute for the truth and [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1334.1000000000001s)]
*  From the beginning this has been about facts facts facts, right? Put them out there [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1337.78s)]
*  Where is the evidence where the receipts put them out there so that people can see the truth [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1343.94s)]
*  This is about someone who's had their career [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1349.7s)]
*  destroyed and trying to build that back [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1352.5800000000002s)]
*  How did Justin take the news Brian it's a having practice law, I know it's never it's never great when you get a decision like this one [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1357.18s)]
*  How's he feeling? [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1364.8600000000001s)]
*  You know, I think that that [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1367.38s)]
*  Injustice [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1370.5s)]
*  Is is a word I think I can best describe it a lack of understanding [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1372.1s)]
*  If she said these things about me that were untrue [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1377.7s)]
*  Outcome I don't have a legal redress in terms of defamation [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1382.06s)]
*  If this you know, you know, and you know, it's clear, you know, the evidence is clear that they secreted to get [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1386.74s)]
*  the the you know information [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1394.46s)]
*  on this Van Zam subpoena and [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1397.9s)]
*  Created, you know this whole law doh lawsuit and [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1400.98s)]
*  And got that information so that no one could see it and then use that information [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1405.3400000000001s)]
*  So that they could put together this hit piece in the New York Times and that was devastating for Justin [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1410.3s)]
*  It was you know, if anybody remembers what December 21st was like [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1416.3s)]
*  for him there was a hundred percent of the people saying he's a horrible person and [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1421.3s)]
*  Zero percent. Well, so for me who actually [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1426.5800000000002s)]
*  Saw him on a day-to-day basis and and his family, you know [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1430.3400000000001s)]
*  Really were on his side until we put out the facts until we put out the receipts until we put out the documents [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1435.3400000000001s)]
*  you know because this has always been about facts and truth and [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1442.88s)]
*  And and and it's you know, it's frustrating for him [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1446.5800000000002s)]
*  Who knows exactly what he did and didn't didn't do did he acquiesce too much to her demands? [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1450.7s)]
*  Absolutely because he was afraid [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1457.46s)]
*  That's very different than whether he sexually harassed her [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1460.5s)]
*  Is his career in ruins? Are he are people not offering him jobs? Is he not able to get funding for an additional picture? [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1464.78s)]
*  You know, he's lost jobs it has affected his career at the moment [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1474.26s)]
*  it's obviously affected, you know him emotionally and his self-esteem and and [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1480.38s)]
*  You know and and he's putting up the best face he can for his family [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1485.46s)]
*  And whatnot, but but all he wants is truly a chance any courtroom and a jury to be able to [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1489.58s)]
*  Tell his story to you know, he's not going around on red carpets. He's not going around, you know, you know, you know with interviews [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1497.66s)]
*  He's not going around on some victory tour [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1505.34s)]
*  even when she dropped her emotional distress claims or and we're in the process of dropping her emotional distress claims and [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1507.9s)]
*  You know [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1514.9s)]
*  They they have an interesting [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1516.06s)]
*  Ability to go on victory tours whether they win or lose so it doesn't doesn't even matter [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1519.1s)]
*  I could see her losing the case and going on a victory tour [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1523.98s)]
*  but that's you know, that's what we're dealing with right when people show you who they are believe them and [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1527.1s)]
*  When she plays what plays well? [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1532.46s)]
*  She she was she's being forced to drop her claims for intentional infliction of emotional distress because she refused to fork over [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1535.26s)]
*  Her medical records when you rightfully asked for them any defense lawyer would if you're getting sued for that claim [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1542.94s)]
*  You say okay show me all your mental distress evidence including your psychiatric records and any [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1548.98s)]
*  Anything else that would support this claim and as soon as you guys guys did that she said never mind [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1555.78s)]
*  I'll withdraw the claims but I want them withdrawn without prejudice so I can file them at any point in future if I change my mind [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1560.02s)]
*  What did you make of how the judge handled that because he seemed to say [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1567.54s)]
*  You're not getting away with that sister [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1570.98s)]
*  That's not happening he seemed to say you guys come up with an agreement on how this is going to get disposed of [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1573.46s)]
*  That is not going to let her get away with [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1578.98s)]
*  Keeping that sword hanging over just in the whole time and also maintaining the position of you don't get to see a single record [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1582.1s)]
*  of me with my therapist [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1588.66s)]
*  Well, the great thing about the law is when you're the plaintiff [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1591.22s)]
*  You have a burden to prove your claims and to prove your damages [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1595.14s)]
*  And as part of that any anyone that claims emotional distress is required to provide evidence of that emotional distress [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1599.54s)]
*  apparently, you know [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1606.48s)]
*  She didn't think the law applied to her. So she decided that she was not going to provide that information [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1608.5s)]
*  And whether it existed or not, she wasn't going to comply with that rule [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1615.06s)]
*  And you know, I think things are still being worked out amongst it [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1620.42s)]
*  But she you know when she makes a decision like that there are consequences that attach to it [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1624.1799999999998s)]
*  You can't just decide that you're going to refile at a later time [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1628.82s)]
*  You can't just decide that let me get through this discovery phase and then i'll put this back on [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1632.1799999999998s)]
*  um, you know the law [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1637.9399999999998s)]
*  Right, the law is supposed to apply to everyone equally, but you know, some people uh, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1640.26s)]
*  Some people believe that it should not [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1644.8999999999999s)]
*  What's happening it to the extent you can tell us with taylor swift because [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1647.8600000000001s)]
*  There was um some reporting that you wanted to get the text messages between blake lively and taylor [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1653.8600000000001s)]
*  And that there was a potential for subpoenaing [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1659.8600000000001s)]
*  taylor swift in this case via [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1663.5400000000002s)]
*  document subpoena to get her [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1666.02s)]
*  Texts and possibly even a deposition and then that her father allegedly came to you and said [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1667.8600000000001s)]
*  I will tell you what's in the text and the reason i'll tell you is because [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1674.82s)]
*  Blake lively's threatening my daughter taylor swift that if she doesn't speak out on blake lively's behalf [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1678.34s)]
*  Uh that blake lively is going to retaliate in some way. So tell us what you can [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1686.42s)]
*  Sure, just out of respect for you know people that aren't [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1691.54s)]
*  parties to the lawsuit [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1696.5s)]
*  Um, there's not a whole lot that I can get into [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1698.42s)]
*  Um, but you know, I think that that people who are relevant to the case and people who um, you know [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1701.94s)]
*  Have otherwise been with people from the beginning of the case side by side shoulder by shoulder [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1710.34s)]
*  um, you know our our potentially witnesses in the case and and so [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1717.06s)]
*  You know, those are things that that we need to look into those are things to see, you know [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1723.6200000000001s)]
*  What in addition to what we know already? [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1728.42s)]
*  We need and um and then to move forward and and obtain that discovery [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1731.46s)]
*  There's a short leash on on how far we can go with discovery [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1736.1000000000001s)]
*  I think the judge made has made it very clear that you know, third parties need to be directly relevant to claims [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1740.58s)]
*  Um, and we think certain third parties are directly relevant, but it's just whether or not you need that evidence in addition to what you have already [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1747.14s)]
*  hmm, are you able to say whether [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1755.3s)]
*  You believe or have reason to allege that blake lively threatened taylor swift [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1759.0600000000002s)]
*  If she did not come out and speak on blake's behalf. The truth is I I don't think I should speak on it [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1763.6200000000001s)]
*  Um, I think we should wait and see, you know have the evidence [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1770.02s)]
*  Um, you know ferrets out on that. I think you know look look I think [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1773.6200000000001s)]
*  We've all you know those who have looked at the timeline those who have looked at all of the [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1778.5s)]
*  Documents that that have been put forth [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1785.76s)]
*  There's more video evidence. I mean there's there's the video of this whole this is a film shoot, right? [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1789.14s)]
*  Like there's there's there's filming of the film shoot [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1794.3400000000001s)]
*  Right. I mean, you know megan you saw the scene. Um, you know where they're dancing [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1798.1000000000001s)]
*  And and everyone can judge for themselves again, you know dealing with you know [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1804.18s)]
*  We're dealing with people who look at a scene and say [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1808.8200000000002s)]
*  The sky is not blue. What do you mean? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1813.22s)]
*  That blue is not blue, right? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1815.86s)]
*  And and I think that will forever be the case [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1818.1s)]
*  But you know, fortunately she doesn't get to be a juror along with being you know, the plaintiff [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1820.8999999999999s)]
*  so we'll um [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1827.62s)]
*  We'll have different people that will be the jurors and hopefully they'll be able to see the sky's blue [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1829.3799999999999s)]

*  And the real facts of what happened. I mean there's real time evidence in this case [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1863.3s)]
*  I mean you heard justin on the voicemail you heard what he was going through [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1868.1000000000001s)]

*  Um, you know when you you know famous supreme court, you know justice said, you know [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1889.94s)]
*  You'll know pornography when you see it, um, I don't think a birthing scene where where no one is unclothed [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1895.3799999999999s)]
*  Is pornography. I mean you you've seen her say that she you know had had you know was [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1901.54s)]
*  Unclothed in you know with barely a patch on her and and we know there are you know that she was wearing those shorts [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1907.9199999999998s)]
*  Um, you know, you know, this stuff is not new we've gone through the facts [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1915.3799999999999s)]
*  And truth is on our side. The facts are on our side. I love [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1920.4199999999998s)]
*  Not like love our chances [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1924.6599999999999s)]
*  What are the chances now brian of a settlement in light of [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1929.3799999999999s)]
*  The ruling on her emotional distress claims and the ruling on your defamation and related counterclaims [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1933.3s)]
*  Look from the beginning, you know the the chances of settlement were were next to zero when you add [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1940.98s)]
*  The the the parties that are involved in this [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1948.02s)]
*  You know justin, you know while he would have liked to get you know millions of dollars to compensate him [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1951.06s)]
*  For his damages as a result of the defamation [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1956.8999999999999s)]
*  That that was always secondary [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1960.74s)]
*  To showing that there was no sexual harassment [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1963.3s)]
*  That's it. I mean when you're accused of something wrongfully [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1967.78s)]
*  When you you know have to prove your innocence [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1972.1s)]
*  In order to continue to work [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1975.86s)]
*  Um [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1978.5s)]
*  There are there are very little choices here [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1979.3799999999999s)]
*  So he is going to go all the way [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1981.9399999999998s)]
*  And get that adjudication [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1984.34s)]
*  and fight this fight [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1986.58s)]
*  um for [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1988.58s)]
*  Ever and whether that means appeals or anything else he's going to make sure that the world knows [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1989.86s)]
*  That he did not engage in sexual harassment [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=1996.9799999999998s)]
*  Period end of story [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2000.1799999999998s)]
*  Can you say that you're already there [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2003.14s)]
*  I mean, I think there's a very strong argument to be made that he's already won that battle. He's [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2005.14s)]
*  she's [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2010.74s)]
*  Amber heard in the eyes of at least half if not more of the country [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2012.02s)]
*  This has been an interesting case because it didn't divide along left right lines [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2016.5s)]
*  This is much like megan markel [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2021.22s)]
*  Blake lively has managed to unite the right and the left against her. Trust me [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2024.26s)]
*  I know because I hear from them [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2029.38s)]
*  And I wonder to myself brian whether justin's already won that victory [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2031.38s)]
*  And whether as a result [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2035.38s)]
*  He's interested if the opportunity is there anyway and making the litigation just go away now [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2037.6200000000001s)]
*  Right. Well, I I don't think he's won that battle, you know yet. I think what he's done is he's put evidence out [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2043.7800000000002s)]
*  Um, and he's put truth out and people have made their own determinations which you know seemingly have only one [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2051.78s)]
*  Um determination that you can make if you've actually looked at the facts and the evidence [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2059.78s)]
*  Um, but I don't think he's he's gotten that moment where you know [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2064.7400000000002s)]
*  Where a court and a jury of his peers say no, no, no, this is not sexual harassment [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2069.06s)]
*  And I don't think look I don't think tag the pr team with melissa nathan and her team their team of people that that that [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2075.3s)]
*  Literally have nothing to do with this [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2083.14s)]
*  They're just you know individuals and and jen abel who's been just trashed after you know taking her phone [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2084.9s)]
*  and um, I think these people want to be [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2091.54s)]
*  um [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2095.3s)]
*  Obsolved on a public level from a jury of their peers. I think it's really important that that happen [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2096.1600000000003s)]
*  Especially when someone goes around, you know making victory tours without you know [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2103.38s)]
*  Without regard to whatever the real result is I mean you saw you saw victory tours [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2109.46s)]
*  When when they lost them with the emotional distress claims, right? Like you saw a victory tour then so [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2114.9s)]
*  You know again people are showing you who they are believe them [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2121.7s)]
*  So you you say he's in it to the jury verdict [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2126.66s)]
*  Yes [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2131.62s)]
*  Wow [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2133.38s)]
*  Wow [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2134.1s)]
*  That's not good for her. She's not going to want that [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2135.06s)]
*  I I think she already likely regrets having started this hornet's nest as much as she wants to play the victim at the time [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2137.22s)]
*  100 and everywhere else [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2142.58s)]
*  Let me um, if I if you don't mind, can I just ask you because you're like the waldo of litigation brian [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2144.8199999999997s)]
*  Your name comes up in cases. I didn't even know you had a hand in i'm just covering them as a reporter [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2151.54s)]
*  I'm like he's there too like the diddy trial where I think you were representing capricorn clark [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2157.38s)]
*  one of the witnesses for [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2163.46s)]
*  The prosecution who took the stand and I just wonder and maybe you can't say anything but any thoughts on how that trial is going? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2166.02s)]
*  Um, you know, I have a lot of thoughts it's you know, it's it's it's it's interesting [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2175.3s)]
*  um how the case is going and um [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2182.1800000000003s)]
*  You know, I look I I think a lot of things are really interesting. We're moving into a world of ai where um, [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2185.54s)]
*  You're going to look at a video you could do it now [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2191.62s)]
*  And you're not going to know what's real or what's not real [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2194.1s)]
*  I mean some of the news feeds that that I see are are are inaccurate and not real and you know, sometimes [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2196.42s)]
*  you know, um people do apologize for things I think I was surprised that that um, [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2203.86s)]
*  Diddy came out and apologized nationally? [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2210.02s)]
*  For the the video in the hotel [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2213.54s)]
*  Where where he was brutally beating? [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2217.06s)]
*  You know cassie and um, and and I think that changed the nature of the case the case then [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2219.62s)]
*  Became about okay, you know, I I can be an abuser [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2225.38s)]
*  I can you know deal with domestic violence and getting into fights like that, but [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2229.14s)]
*  You know, that's where I draw the line [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2234.58s)]
*  I don't drug or rape people and and you know and and do those and and i'm not involved in an organized organized crime [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2236.2599999999998s)]
*  You know unit and things like that and it'll be interesting to see where that case ends up [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2244.02s)]
*  But you know capricorn clark is is a credible person [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2250.58s)]
*  Really truthful really interesting [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2255.06s)]
*  um, and um, and you know and and look I you know, I all someone can ask for is [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2257.46s)]
*  A real jury of their peers to make a decision and he's got he's got an opportunity to do that. He's got great lawyers [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2263.7s)]
*  um, and he's got you know a good team and um [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2269.86s)]
*  And the jury will make a decision based on what's happened in the courtroom and and and I don't know exactly what's happened [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2273.7s)]
*  So I just read the papers like everyone else or hear from from friends that are lawyers or involved in the case [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2280.1s)]
*  But I don't I don't know. I don't know per se [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2285.54s)]
*  Capricorn did a good job in my opinion on the stand and she was [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2289.68s)]
*  important because she was his assistant for years and testified that [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2293.7599999999998s)]
*  He brought her with him over to kid cuddy's house when he allegedly [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2297.22s)]
*  Burgled it and then um later is accused of having launched a molotov [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2301.86s)]
*  Cocktail into it and she she provided a lot of the details that i'm sure it was scary to get up there and talk [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2306.74s)]
*  about all right last one [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2311.86s)]
*  Menendez you're in that too [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2314.56s)]
*  Our friend mark out garagos comes on and talks to me about it from time to time and you're on the side of representing [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2316.2599999999998s)]
*  I think some family members of jose menendez who would like to see the the boys [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2321.46s)]
*  Released um, and it looks like things are they took one step [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2327.06s)]
*  Closer to potentially getting them out. But what's happening with the menendez brothers? And do you think that they will be released early? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2331.46s)]
*  Um, you know what's happening is that that they have been resentenced [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2339.78s)]
*  Um, which is phenomenal. I mean, you know rarely do you see [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2344.34s)]
*  The [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2349.38s)]
*  27 family members who are all on the side of enough is enough [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2350.48s)]
*  Um, they should be released, you know, rarely do you see that? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2355.86s)]
*  Um that those you know, remember the family members aren't just family members of you know, lial and eric [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2359.3s)]
*  They're family members of jose and kitty so they are victims and as victims they they say enough is enough [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2364.9s)]
*  It's it's time to release them [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2371.6200000000003s)]
*  Um the judge, you know jessip who is an incredible judge [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2373.7000000000003s)]
*  And he saw right through all of this and and resentenced them [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2379.3s)]
*  They have an opportunity now to go in front of the parole board [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2382.66s)]
*  Which the the you know, which is going to happen in august and then we'll we'll see what happens from there [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2386.66s)]
*  But i'm really optimistic for the family that they're going to have a chance to have [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2392.58s)]
*  You know holiday meals, you know, maybe even spend, you know [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2397.2999999999997s)]
*  You know new year's day and new year's eve with their family and be together for the first time [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2401.2999999999997s)]
*  in over 35 years and [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2407.06s)]

*  And i'm sure they would like their day in court. So in any event this thing will keep going [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2719.06s)]
*  And uh right now they have a trial date. I believe it's march of 26 [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gm8cXmwJc9w&t=2722.9799999999996s)]
