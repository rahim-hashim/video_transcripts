# Baby Goes Missing, Mother Questioned - Part 1 of Megyn Kelly Investigates: Baby Lisa's Disappearance
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q)
*  I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to The Megyn Kelly Show and our special series, Megyn Kelly Investigates. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=0.0s)]
*  This is on the disappearance of Baby Lisa. Over the next five days, we will bring you [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=7.0s)]
*  deep into a story that captivated and horrified America, including yours truly. It has stuck [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=12.16s)]
*  with me since I first covered it at Fox News. Thirteen years later, it is a case that has [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=18.88s)]
*  never been solved. It is about the mystery of Baby Lisa Irwin, a beautiful, healthy baby [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=25.42s)]
*  girl who vanished in the middle of the night, never to be found, right out of her crib. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=32.34s)]
*  I want to start with why we're bringing you this, all right? As you're going to see throughout [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=39.34s)]
*  this episode and the four that come after it, I covered my story this self, as I mentioned, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=42.38s)]
*  as it happened back in 2011 and then in the many years thereafter. I remember at the time [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=47.22s)]
*  I first got sent to Kansas City, Missouri, I had my own baby girl in a crib at home [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=52.82s)]
*  and just couldn't fathom what it would be like to go in to check on her in the middle [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=59.18s)]
*  of the night or go get her in the morning and see an empty crib. Speaking to her parents [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=63.88s)]
*  at the time was a before and after moment for me. It was shocking for the reasons that [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=70.46000000000001s)]
*  you will hear in this series. And the case has never been solved. This is not a series [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=76.9s)]
*  where at the end we're going to say this person was arrested, but you are going to have some [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=82.86s)]
*  theories. So a couple of years ago, I began reporting this story anew. I decided since [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=87.94000000000001s)]
*  we launched the Megyn Kelly show to take this on with my own resources and to devote countless [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=94.22s)]
*  hours to figuring out what happened to this baby with the help of some producers and very [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=100.86s)]
*  talented investigators. The investigative team you will know from this show, Bill Stanton, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=107.32s)]
*  former NYPD and Phil Houston, former CIA known as the human lie detector, that will be put [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=113.1s)]
*  to the test, that moniker in later episodes of this series. But I started interviewing [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=117.88s)]
*  all the key players again and I got to some critical new ones, some of whom have never [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=123.66s)]
*  before been interviewed by anybody other than law enforcement in connection with this case. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=129.92s)]
*  We tried and may have gotten to the truth of what happened here. We uncovered quite a bit. See for [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=134.82s)]
*  yourselves. Here's episode one. The IRS is the largest collection agency in the world and with [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=143.51999999999998s)]
*  April 15th fast approaching, it's more aggressive than ever. If you owe back taxes or have unfiled [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=151.07999999999998s)]
*  returns, waiting is not a great option. Don't do it. April 15th could mark another tax year [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=155.92s)]
*  that just passed you by and added to your stress. So the smart move is to get ahead of it now. But [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=160.88s)]
*  you know, do not contact the IRS alone. That's crazy talk. Instead, you could let the experts at [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=166.2s)]
*  Tax Network USA handle this for you. Why? Well, not all tax resolution companies are the same. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=172.29999999999998s)]
*  Tax Network USA has a preferred direct line to the IRS so they know exactly which agents to deal [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=178.29999999999998s)]
*  with and which to avoid. With proven strategies to settle tax problems in your favor, whether you [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=183.7s)]
*  owe 10 grand or 10 million, Tax Network USA's attorneys and negotiators have already resolved [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=188.89999999999998s)]
*  over 1 billion in tax debt. Speak with one of their strategists today for free. Don't let the IRS [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=193.73999999999998s)]
*  control your future. 1-800-958-1000 or visit tnusa.com slash Megan. tnusa.com slash Megan, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=198.98s)]
*  April 15th at Just Around the Corner. Act now before the IRS acts first. We begin on North Lister [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=206.42s)]
*  Avenue in Kansas City, Missouri, a family neighborhood, quiet, working class, and on October 4th, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=212.46s)]
*  2011, about to become the center of the biggest crime story in America. This one may be Venik. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=218.98000000000002s)]
*  Lady, break your home. 10-month-old baby Lisa Irwin disappeared in the middle of the night. Father [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=226.02s)]
*  Jeremy came home from his night shift at 3 45 a.m. and found the lights were on. A window was open, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=233.86s)]
*  the screen pushed in, the front door unlocked, and his baby girl was not in her crib. Must be a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=240.38s)]
*  reasonable explanation, he thought. His first instinct? Don't panic. That's the last thing you [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=246.78s)]
*  expect is that one of your kids is going to be missing. So initially when she's not in the crib, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=252.45999999999998s)]
*  it's like, okay, well, she's in bed with Deborah, she's in bed with one of the brothers, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=257.82s)]
*  she's maybe fallen out of bed, and she's asleep under the crib. He woke up the baby's mother, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=262.62s)]
*  his partner, Deborah Bradley, out of a sound sleep. She appeared to have no idea why baby Lisa was [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=268.66s)]
*  not in her crib. Jeremy ran next door to see if somehow the neighbor had the baby. Then he called [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=274.66s)]
*  9-1-1. Jeremy and Deborah immediately went public, begging for help. No questions asked. Just drop [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=286.58s)]
*  her off with somebody at a hospital, a church, the fire department, the police station, anywhere. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=291.38s)]
*  Just please bring her home. How do you think about it today? Jeremy Irwin. It's still pretty [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=296.18s)]
*  similar to the way it has been. It's a lot of frustration and some anger and mostly just feeling [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=307.1s)]
*  like you're missing a huge giant chunk of your life. Deborah Bradley was just 25 then, she's 38 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=315.98s)]
*  now. Your case is so unique because it became a huge national news story. And you now have old [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  interviews of yourself and press conferences. You know, when you look back on that, what do you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=331.90000000000003s)]
*  think? I think I can't believe I survived. And though so much time has passed, what happened to [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=338.06s)]
*  Lisa that night remains a mystery. News of Lisa's disappearance traveled fast. Search crews combed [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=352.46000000000004s)]
*  the neighborhood, police dogs were deployed, and the media descended on North Lister Avenue, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=361.18s)]
*  a classic crescent-shaped suburban street just north of the Missouri River. Deborah's aunt, [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=370.38s)]
*  Cindy Lorette, still chokes up remembering that terrible day back in 2011. It was crazy, unlike [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=377.21999999999997s)]
*  anything I've ever seen before or I've seen thus. I mean, every which way you look, there was police [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=383.21999999999997s)]
*  officers, there was cars, there was people. I remember the CNN van, I remember HLN van. You [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=391.53999999999996s)]
*  couldn't get down the streets. There was literally reporters climbing in trees trying to get snapshots [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=398.73999999999995s)]
*  of us. What were your first impressions of the story and the scene? Jim Spellman was there from [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=404.82s)]
*  the start reporting the story for CNN and its sister channel, Headline News. This was a [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=408.58s)]
*  neighborhood not unlike where I grew up, a kind of a working class-ish neighborhood, well-kept homes, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=413.46s)]
*  but not the kind of families that would be prepared to deal with the onslaught of media, [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=419.29999999999995s)]
*  police, lawyers, and everything else that would be involved in something like this. It's also a [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=424.26s)]
*  neighborhood that was shocked because, you know, this was a neighborhood full of kids and families, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=429.46s)]
*  and one of their own was dealing with, I think, every parent's nightmare. In those critical early [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=433.94s)]
*  hours and days, Kansas City police, the FBI, the ATF, and a group of local volunteers searched the [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=440.02s)]
*  area. They did not find Lisa or any hard evidence. Within a week, a timeline of the day began to [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=446.5s)]
*  emerge. 2.30 p.m. Debra's dad comes by with her brother, Philip Nutz. 4.45 p.m. Debra and Philip [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=453.7s)]
*  go by Baby Formula and Boxed Wine. They're seen on store security video. Around 5.00 p.m., [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=462.34s)]
*  next-door neighbor Samantha Brando drops by. 5.15 p.m. Jeremy, an electrician, gets a call from his [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=470.09999999999997s)]
*  boss and soon leaves to work at a Starbucks, unaware of the chaos and tragedy about to unfold [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=477.21999999999997s)]
*  just hours later. 6.00 p.m. Debra makes dinner for Samantha, Sam's daughter, as well as Lisa and her [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=483.62s)]
*  two half-brothers, 5-year-old Michael and 7-year-old Blake. 6.30 p.m. Debra puts Lisa to bed. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=490.5s)]
*  By 7.00 p.m., Samantha's daughter and Debra's boys are inside playing. Baby Lisa is supposed to be in [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=498.5s)]
*  her crib asleep. Both moms sit on the front steps, smoking, talking, and drinking. Between 8.00 and [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=504.66s)]
*  10.00 p.m., Shane Begley, a 33-year-old landscaper who was the grandson of a neighbor, stops by the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=510.98s)]
*  stoop for a visit. Sometime around 10.30 to 11.00 p.m., Debra said, she checked on Baby Lisa, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=517.7s)]
*  then went down the hall and got in bed with the two boys. Before bed, Debra leaves three cell phones [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=524.26s)]
*  on the kitchen counter, two with restricted use because of non-payment. It is believed only one [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=530.9000000000001s)]
*  worked normally. They all end up missing. 10.30 p.m. Samantha Brando is back home. She reportedly [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=536.9000000000001s)]
*  later said that she noticed the lights were turned off at Debra and Jeremy's house. Some [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=545.54s)]
*  leads quickly emerged with possible sightings of a kidnapper. The next morning, 7-year-old Blake [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=551.4599999999999s)]
*  tells police he heard noises during the night. Also the next morning, the Parscals, who lived [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=557.06s)]
*  around the corner, told police what they had seen. Husband Onesto was leaving for his overnight shift [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=563.14s)]
*  and wife Lisa was awakened inside. Once again, reporter Jim Spellman. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=569.7s)]
*  He thinks this is weird enough that he phones her in the house from the car and says, hey, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=574.98s)]
*  come and take a look at this. And she sees this man walking up the street holding a baby, not [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=579.7800000000001s)]
*  wearing clothes. And having been in the window where she could see this happening and having [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=587.7s)]
*  been standing where his car was parked, it would not be a problem to view this even though it's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=594.42s)]
*  past midnight. There were plenty of street lights. So show me exactly what you did. You looked out [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=600.02s)]
*  this window, tell me where your husband was and tell me what you saw. Nobody's mind immediately [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=604.0999999999999s)]
*  goes to, oh, somebody's kidnapping this baby. That's what she told me. She said my mind did [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=610.18s)]
*  not immediately think kidnapping. But the first thing in the morning when she saw this commotion [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=614.26s)]
*  going on was she told the police about this. What time of night did she say she saw the man [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=618.5799999999999s)]
*  with the baby? I'll tell you. And she had it exactly because she showed me the phone records [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=623.78s)]
*  from her husband calling her. 12 15. 12 15 a.m. Stranger abductions put children in the most dire [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=627.86s)]
*  situation. And so we know time is ticking. Callahan Walsh of the Center for Missing and [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=637.22s)]
*  Exploited Children. Those early hours are the most critical because within the first two hours, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=643.22s)]
*  there's a 70% chance you'll recover the child deceased and about a 90% chance after 24 hours. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=648.42s)]
*  In a case like this where we don't know exactly who took baby Erwin and it's a possibility that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=655.3s)]
*  it's a stranger abduction, we know times of the essence. Was Lisa the baby in the man's arms? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=660.3399999999999s)]
*  More suspicious things happen in those early hours. 2 30 a.m. There's a dumpster fire in a [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=667.4599999999999s)]
*  parking lot not too far from the Parscals house. Could this be related? At 2 45 a.m., a nearby BP [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=673.62s)]
*  gas station surveillance camera shows a man in a light t-shirt emerging from the woods that [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=681.94s)]
*  bordered the neighborhood. It's too dark and grainy to see if he's carrying anything. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=687.3s)]
*  And then as I reported for Fox News at the time, Deborah's first account of her timeline gets a [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=693.46s)]
*  serious revision. Turns out she was drinking more than she originally claimed and she's no [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=699.14s)]
*  longer sure about when she last saw her baby girl. When you went in at 10 30 after the neighbor left, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=705.22s)]
*  what did you do? Probably went right to my room. Why do you say probably? Because sometimes I check [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=711.9399999999999s)]
*  on her. Well, most of the time I check on her and then the boys. So I'm assuming that I went and [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=720.1s)]
*  checked on her too, but I don't know. You don't remember? No. Let's talk about the wine. How much [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=726.42s)]
*  did you consume that day? I had several glasses of wine. When you say several, more than three? [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=734.18s)]
*  Yeah, but that has nothing to do with her. More than five? Probably. More than 10? No. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=742.74s)]
*  Was it just wine or was there other alcohol? Yeah, just wine. Just wine. Lisa was in bed and the boys were laying down watching a movie with the neighbor's daughter. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=752.42s)]
*  Were you drunk? Yeah. So the last time Deborah is sure she saw Lisa was at 6 30 p.m. before she started [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=761.62s)]
*  drinking. Could something have happened accidentally? Maybe Lisa fell or was dropped or Deborah unknowingly [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=770.66s)]
*  rolled over on her while they slept or worse, did she deliberately kill her own child? [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=777.78s)]
*  At the very least, Deborah is drunk and unreliable. It was a tough interview. I went pretty hard on you. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=784.42s)]
*  You fessed up. You said, I had a lot of drinks that night, someplace between six and 10. And I think I [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=791.78s)]
*  blacked out. Now, a lot of people wouldn't have admitted that. A lot of people would not have sat [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=799.4599999999999s)]
*  down with the press and said that at all. They would have been worried that it would have made them [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=803.86s)]
*  look some certain way. I didn't care how I looked. I mean, yes, Debbie drank. Deborah's aunt, Cindy [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=808.9s)]
*  Lorette. Debbie probably still drinks. It doesn't fucking matter. It does not matter. Sorry, I said that. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=815.22s)]
*  We all do. And if you're the perfect parent, then good for you. Because this could happen to anybody. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=822.98s)]
*  You don't plan on things like this to happen. You don't plan on turning the TV on and seeing [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=828.4200000000001s)]
*  one of your relatives missing, let alone a 10-month-old baby. The door wasn't locked, right? [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=832.66s)]
*  Reporter Jim Spelman. The door was not locked. But keep in mind that by her own admission, [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=837.9399999999999s)]
*  Deborah Bradley was drinking that night. I'm not sure that she could be trusted to confidently say [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=844.42s)]
*  whether she locked the door or not. Obviously, they are our main focus. I'm not calling them suspects. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=850.42s)]
*  Knowing her timeline was problematic and wanting to prove to police she had nothing to hide, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=856.1s)]
*  Deborah volunteered to take a polygraph. And then she took police remarks to mean she had failed it. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=861.3s)]
*  We were done and I was like, OK, so, you know, what happens now? And he goes, it gets real close to me [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=867.8599999999999s)]
*  and he goes, I think that you're a very bad mother. And I just broke down. And I said that it's not [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=873.9399999999999s)]
*  possible that I failed. And he just kept saying, I think you're a bad mother. You need to tell us [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=882.3399999999999s)]
*  what you did. And I just kind of fell apart. Not going to lie, my nerves, I actually [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=886.58s)]
*  wet myself because I couldn't believe what he was saying to me. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=894.18s)]
*  Exhausted and emotional, Deborah and Jeremy decide they have shared everything they can think of to [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=899.22s)]
*  help the investigation and need a break. But Kansas City police publicly criticized the couple [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=904.5s)]
*  for not continuing to talk to them. The news coverage is wall to wall. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=910.34s)]
*  Just a couple hours ago at a news conference held by Kansas City police and investigators in the case. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=915.14s)]
*  They've always been free. They've been cooperative up to this point, but early this evening they [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=920.18s)]
*  decided to stop cooperating with the Texas Kansas City attorney, Sean O'Brien. And so the public [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=923.78s)]
*  impression was these parents had something to hide. And and that came through on the news coverage. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=928.9s)]
*  All along, police said Lisa's parents, Jeremy Irwin and Deborah Bradley, cooperated with police [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=936.02s)]
*  until Thursday night. Her parents are no longer cooperating with police. I don't get it because [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=941.86s)]
*  as a parent myself, if my child was missing, I would give anything I have. Despite the sighting [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=948.82s)]
*  of the man with the baby, one week into the case, police seemed to have only one suspect, her mother. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=955.22s)]
*  ABC News legal correspondent Dan Abrams asked Jeremy the question on everyone's mind. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=962.02s)]
*  Could Deborah have done something accidentally? No. Maybe she tried to cover it up. No. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=967.7s)]
*  The first time I even thought that was when the police had started asking us about it. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=976.9000000000001s)]
*  So just from the statistic standpoint, it didn't surprise me that law enforcement was really going [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=982.82s)]
*  after Deborah and also Jeremy. That's Marissa Rendazzo, the former chief research psychologist [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=988.1s)]
*  at the U.S. Secret Service. She would soon be tapped to work on this case. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=995.3s)]
*  From the criminal psychologist side of me, I wondered what involvement she or her husband [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1000.0999999999999s)]
*  might have had. And so did I. And so did lots of people. But when Kansas City attorney Sean [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1006.5s)]
*  O'Brien started working with Deborah and Jeremy, he quickly realized no one was getting the whole [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1012.02s)]
*  story. Because the police kept saying the parents aren't cooperating, the parents aren't cooperating. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1017.4599999999999s)]
*  It was like the mantra they were putting out on television. And it wasn't until after I got into [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1022.42s)]
*  the case, I realized that was totally not true. You know, they had spent 40 hours in questioning [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1027.7s)]
*  with the police before I was brought into the case. These were people who were trying to help [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1032.8999999999999s)]
*  the police find their baby. So why were the police saying that? Were they just making that up? [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1038.98s)]
*  I think they didn't have a better suspect. Interrogation is not investigation. It's a [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1044.18s)]
*  strategy to get a suspect to make an incriminating statement, period. That's all it is. And so it's [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1050.74s)]
*  a really dangerous position for them to be in. The other thing that I found out later had been done [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1057.54s)]
*  was that they pulled a strategy on them that's called the prisoner's dilemma. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1064.18s)]
*  And what you do when you have two suspects in a case is you tell each of them that the other one [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1070.42s)]
*  is implicating them. And so they better start talking and get out ahead of it, [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1076.98s)]
*  or they're going to be the one left holding the bag. And so they did that with Jeremy and Deborah. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1081.94s)]
*  They had each done like a 10-hour videotaped interview. And they took a little snippet out [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1088.5s)]
*  of each one. The cop comes in and he's like, hey, I want you to see something. So he sets his [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1095.6200000000001s)]
*  laptop down in front of me. And it's a video of Deborah. It is Deborah's interrogation video from [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1106.66s)]
*  like day two and three. And he scrolls and he scrolls and he scrolls and he scrolls and scrolls [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1114.18s)]
*  and he scrolls. Finally finds whatever he's looking for, swings the laptop back around, [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1119.0600000000002s)]
*  plays me a 12-second clip of Deborah clearly frustrated, crying. And she says, well, I don't [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1124.8200000000002s)]
*  know. I guess maybe he did it or something to that effect. He did what? I could have stubbed my toe [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1134.66s)]
*  on the door. I could have spilled a cup of coffee. He did what? Like you literally showed me nothing. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1142.5s)]
*  That was just one of the little things that they'll do to you while you're in there. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1148.66s)]
*  And the polygraph? According to one of Deborah's attorneys, Deborah had in fact passed it. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1154.66s)]
*  Obviously their whole thing was it was Deborah. Deborah did it. Deborah did it. So I always kept [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1160.02s)]
*  asking them, Deborah did what? Go ahead, finish your sentence. And there was no sentence to be [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1166.58s)]
*  finished. Psychologist Marissa Rondazo says that's confirmation bias. Essentially what confirmation [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1172.18s)]
*  bias is that once you develop a theory, it's human nature to seek out information that confirms that [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1178.98s)]
*  theory and disregard information that would undercut that theory. It appeared that they were [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1185.06s)]
*  not pursuing alternate possibilities with as many resources or sort of energy as they were [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1192.82s)]
*  their theory that it was Deborah and or Jeremy. Investigators are quickly closing in on the baby's [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1202.6599999999999s)]
*  mother, Deborah. Jeremy's sister Ashley Irwin thought the writing was on the wall and said so [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1208.4199999999998s)]
*  in an interview with ABC News. Do you think Deborah may be facing an arrest? Probably, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1213.86s)]
*  to be real honest with you, yes. Why? Because it's what the police do. They don't have any leads so [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1221.2199999999998s)]
*  they have to pin it on somebody. Do you think it's inevitable? Yeah, kind of. Captain Steve Young of [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1226.74s)]
*  the Kansas City Police Department. You know, we're under pressure to find a child. We're not under [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1233.4599999999998s)]
*  pressure to pin this on anybody or wrap it up or make an arrest. Even so, the pressure on Deborah [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1237.62s)]
*  was intense. Oh, she was just a mess. Cindy Lorette remembers the stress of it. She was [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1242.5s)]
*  staying with the family to help out. She just didn't know which way was up or down or and she [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1248.58s)]
*  would just cry and she would nestle her head under my arm or next to me or she just nobody knew what [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1254.18s)]
*  to do. And now we can introduce you to one of the most intriguing players in this whole story. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1263.86s)]
*  Kristi Schiller is a Houston horse breeder, socialite, one-time playboy model and a broadcaster. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1274.58s)]
*  What was the first you heard about the Lisa Irwin case? So I got a call from my stepson [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1281.54s)]
*  and he said, hurry and turn on Fox News and you were reporting and he said that there's a baby [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1289.5400000000002s)]
*  that's been kidnapped in Kansas City. Then Kristi got a call from a family friend, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1296.1000000000001s)]
*  Deborah's cousin Mike Lorette. And he called me and he said, I'm here in Kansas City and trying [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1301.46s)]
*  to protect my cousin and her husband. He said there's news people shoving cameras through the [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1307.6200000000001s)]
*  windows. I'd like to thank all the people of Kansas City, the local, national media [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1314.18s)]
*  for the continued support and coverage to keep baby Lisa's picture out there. He said, I'm just [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1322.18s)]
*  scared. He said, I just don't know what to do. He said, I'm trained for DEF CON 4 and I just don't [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1328.5s)]
*  feel like anybody's coming here to help us. And I said, help is on the way. Kristi had her own [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1333.78s)]
*  theories. She had spent that summer glued to the trial of Casey Anthony, a mother accused of [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1339.38s)]
*  murdering her three year old daughter. I thought for sure that, you know, she was going to go down. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1344.9s)]
*  And when the verdict came in, we, the jury, find the defendant not guilty. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1351.38s)]
*  It just stood there frozen. I couldn't believe it. And I turned around to somebody that was [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1356.5800000000002s)]
*  completely stranger and I said, mark my word, the next parent that does not trim their child's nails [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1361.7800000000002s)]
*  right, they're going to serve hard time. Sure that Deborah was caught in this backlash. Kristi [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1368.66s)]
*  swung into action, tapping into the brain trust of police and legal professionals that she met [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1375.46s)]
*  through her charity, Canines for Cops, created in tribute to a police dog killed in the line of [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1380.42s)]
*  duty. She called Bill Stanton, a former New York City police officer, private investigator, [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1385.78s)]
*  and TV commentator who was on her canine board. Bill assembled a team that included Phil Houston, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1391.7s)]
*  CIA veteran of 25 years. Phil created the deception detection method still being used by the CIA, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1398.66s)]
*  the FBI, the Secret Service, and law enforcement agencies around the nation. He is known as the [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1406.5s)]
*  human lie detector. Former Secret Service psychologist Marissa Rondazo was also part of [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1413.06s)]
*  the team. First order of business, they needed to determine what, if any, involvement Deborah may [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1418.5s)]
*  have had. By this point, the baby's father, Jeremy, had essentially been ruled out because [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1423.7s)]
*  there's security video of him working on an electrical project at Starbucks through most [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1429.14s)]
*  of the night Baby Lisa went missing. Kristi's team began to plan their own videotaped interviews [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1433.46s)]
*  with the parents. Marissa worked with Phil on the questions for Deborah and Jeremy. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1438.74s)]
*  I helped really to talk through with Phil around what angle, what to think about when talking with [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1443.54s)]
*  someone who may be responsible for the disappearance or we were really concerned about [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1450.02s)]
*  possibly the death of Baby Lisa. So we know that the parents, especially the mother, was under [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1453.86s)]
*  suspicion by law enforcement and to figure out kind of what the different angles were, why parents, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1459.7s)]
*  especially mothers, the sort of top motivations of why they do kill their children and to use [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1466.26s)]
*  those angles and perspectives to help formulate the questions that Phil would be asking them. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1472.26s)]
*  Now there was a plane waiting thanks to Kristi Schiller. Bill and Phil headed to Kansas City. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1477.62s)]
*  Once in the Kansas City area in a rented house at a secret location away from the throngs of media, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1483.54s)]
*  Phil and an associate interviewed Deborah. Phil Houston had seen their press conferences and how [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1489.4599999999998s)]
*  they answered questions. Like so many of us, he already had his suspicions about the couple. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1495.06s)]
*  They've been asked, did you do it? Did you do it? Did you do it? And so you have to craft an [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1500.4199999999998s)]
*  approach to the questioning that cuts through that, that minimizes all of the histrionics that have [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1506.34s)]
*  led up to this meeting, if you will. And I was convinced that they were guilty until we asked [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1515.3s)]
*  that first question. We have it on tape, that moment where you got to ask your first question [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1522.1799999999998s)]
*  of Deborah. Let's watch it. Debbie, I think the first question that I need to ask you this morning, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1526.58s)]
*  okay, is what involvement did you have in the disappearance of Lisa? None. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1533.14s)]
*  The only thing I did wrong was drink that night and possibly not be alert, not hear. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1543.6200000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1558.1000000000001s)]
*  What did you glean from that? What are we seeing there? [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1563.6200000000001s)]
*  First of all, if you noticed, I didn't ask her, did you do it? I upped the ante by asking her [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1567.0600000000002s)]
*  a presumptive question. I'm presuming that it's quite possible, maybe even probable that you did [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1574.8200000000002s)]
*  this, that you were involved. What involvement did you have? And her response to that was [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1581.38s)]
*  immediately, without hesitation, none. But then she throws a curveball at us. She says, the only [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1589.06s)]
*  thing I did wrong. So she's confessing, she's saying, look, this is the only thing I did wrong. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1597.86s)]
*  Phil's reaction coming out of this was no matter the angle that we tried, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1607.3s)]
*  no matter the approach of the question, she was answering them truthfully and not showing [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1611.94s)]
*  deception. In a twist even he didn't see coming, Phil determined Deborah is telling the truth, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1617.78s)]
*  that she had nothing to do with her daughter's disappearance. Well, I mean, I, like you, flew out [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1624.58s)]
*  there thinking they did it. It's always the parents. When the wife gets killed, it's always the [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1629.86s)]
*  husband. We all know this. And I remember being flabbergasted. I just couldn't believe, like, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1634.98s)]
*  what do you mean challenged all my own biases? But I think led to better reporting on my part [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1641.46s)]
*  in covering the case, right? Just check your bias. You could be wrong. Have some humility. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1648.1000000000001s)]
*  There are people smarter than you are at detecting deception who say she's not lying and neither's [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1653.14s)]
*  Jeremy. Armed with this knowledge, Christie Shiller anonymously offers a $100,000 reward [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1659.3s)]
*  for information leading to the return of baby Lisa. Bill Stanton made the announcement. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1665.94s)]
*  There's going to be a $100,000 reward put up for the safe return and or [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1672.42s)]
*  conviction of person or persons involved in this horrible crime. Until now, no one knew it was [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1680.98s)]
*  Christie who offered the reward, a secret she managed to keep even from her own husband. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1689.38s)]
*  Is it true? He once said to you, hey, did you hear they posted a reward for the baby? And you [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1694.74s)]
*  were like, and he said, tell me it wasn't you. And he said, what were you thinking? And I said, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1699.7s)]
*  we don't need our name on the side of a building. I want to know that this mother and father are [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1706.82s)]
*  being reunited and the two little boys with their siblings. Announcing the $100,000 reward was just [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1713.6200000000001s)]
*  one way Stanton kept the baby Lisa story in the news. But Bill had a problem. After the press [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1721.14s)]
*  conference and I said a, an anonymous benefactor, this nasty rumor of it was either NBC or ABC, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1727.14s)]
*  and they were paying behind the scenes to get all the exclusives and attention. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1735.8600000000001s)]
*  And that's when he called me. No one believes the anonymous benefactor. I need for you to verify it [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1740.8200000000002s)]
*  to your comfort level and we'll go from there. And I was thinking, sure, yes, I'll, I'm interested [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1747.54s)]
*  in this story at any level. But of course, what I would ultimately like is to talk to the parents. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1754.74s)]
*  And that's where it landed. And, you know, explosive details came out that day, you know, had its highs [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1760.02s)]
*  and lows for Deborah, because that's when the public learned she had between six and 10 drinks. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1765.86s)]
*  Do you have a drinking problem? No, I don't think so. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1772.26s)]
*  Some folks are going to have an issue with you. I'm sure they are more than five drinks while [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1778.26s)]
*  you're looking after a little baby and two little boys. She was sleeping. I wanted to ask, so why [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1782.9799999999998s)]
*  did you choose to share that with me? Because it has nothing to do with Lisa's abduction. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1787.86s)]
*  And I want to be honest about everything so that people will look for her because I feel like if [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1793.06s)]
*  they're like, oh, she's being honest about that, she's got to be telling the truth about other [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1798.1s)]
*  stuff. And any publicity for Lisa is good, whether people like what I say or not. That's true. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1801.6999999999998s)]
*  The wall to wall media coverage continued. They are still searching urgently for the child, [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1809.4599999999998s)]
*  although they do say that as every hour passes, this case gets harder to solve. And at this point, [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1815.06s)]
*  police freely admit they have no suspects and no leads. That was always one of the biggest [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1820.58s)]
*  mysteries about this case. Like what kind of criminal, whether it's a parent, a family member [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1826.1s)]
*  or an intruder, is so good that they don't leave behind a fingerprint, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1833.54s)]
*  DNA or any other really meaningful clue? Because no matter who did this, they did escape without a [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1840.98s)]
*  trace. Reporter Jim Spellman. So I think there's two possible answers to that. The first is if it's [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1848.82s)]
*  somebody who you expect to have in the house, in any house in a crime scene, if you expect to find [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1854.34s)]
*  their DNA and their fingerprints, then that evidence is of little help to investigators. [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1860.58s)]
*  But I think what you're asking is really an incredible question because as you try to run [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1866.1s)]
*  through potential scenarios in your head, guessing more than anything, they just so many of them lead [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1871.54s)]
*  to dead ends. Is there some way that Deborah Bradley or her husband Jeremy somehow did this [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1877.06s)]
*  themselves and were able to pull this off in a short matter of hours? It seems incredibly unlikely. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1883.3s)]
*  But then could some stranger somehow know that this was a house that had a baby in it, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1890.1s)]
*  where the husband was working a very rare night shift, where the mom was perhaps not at her best, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1896.98s)]
*  or having done some serious drinking that night. And then that's the night you stealthily get in [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1905.3799999999999s)]
*  and out of the house, making it through neighbors and everything else. That seems equally as unlikely. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1911.54s)]
*  There's so much we don't know about the evidence because Kansas City PD won't talk to us. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1919.3s)]
*  They say that's because this is still an open investigation. We have our doubts about how much [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1924.1s)]
*  investigating is really going on and for that matter about how they handled this case. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1929.7s)]
*  Now I'm joined by Phil Houston and Bill Stanton. They will be my partners in crime on this, [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1935.94s)]
*  my go-to criminal experts as we take a hard look at the facts of this case. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1941.06s)]
*  Looking back now, 12 years later, there's no nest cameras in every door. There's no even low-grade [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1947.3s)]
*  security cameras. Every gas station now has a good camera that will show you most of what happened [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1956.58s)]
*  there. In today's day and age, they'll be able to zero right in on whoever that was that emerged. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1964.58s)]
*  And what a difference a decade makes. And that's why 12 years later, we're still talking about it, [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1970.26s)]
*  trying to solve it, because it's every person's, every parent's worst nightmare. Someone coming [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1976.74s)]
*  into your home in the middle of the night and taking the most precious thing that you'll ever [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1983.7s)]
*  have in your life, your child. The police really do seem to be guilty of some tunnel vision here. [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1989.7s)]
*  What we're learning already is that they're really interested, Phil, in Deborah and Jeremy. And in [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=1996.42s)]
*  the opening hours of an investigation, one can completely understand that. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2003.54s)]
*  Absolutely. And they both look guilty as sin, if you look at it just from a global perspective. [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2009.94s)]
*  And then you have Deborah admitting to excessive drinking, to the point of possibly blacking out. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2016.8200000000002s)]
*  And you have cops saying that the parents stopped cooperating, which, you know, that [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2024.26s)]
*  leads everybody to be like, oh, that's it, they're guilty. She was done being interrogated over and [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2031.3s)]
*  over and over and over by police she definitely accurately believed had a foregone conclusion [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2036.34s)]
*  about her. And the other part to that too is, is that Deborah is no shrinking violet. I mean, [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2042.02s)]
*  she's not afraid, you know, when you reach a certain point, to really let people know what [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2046.98s)]
*  she's thinking about how they're behaving towards her. And I don't know this, I'm speculating, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2052.9s)]
*  but that she probably became fairly angry. And that anger could have been misinterpreted [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2059.06s)]
*  in the interrogations. Plus just the odds, the overwhelming odds, you know, are she did it. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2065.7000000000003s)]
*  That's the biggest obstacle to ruling her out. But let's spend a moment ruling her in. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2073.78s)]
*  How does that look? What evidence does point to Deborah? [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2078.26s)]
*  Okay, it's a tough one. So let's, let's go with this hypothesis. So was it intentional or [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2082.18s)]
*  unintentional? If it was intentional, then we're going to say she didn't drink as much. She was [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2089.62s)]
*  tossing the alcohol, making it seem like she was drunk to the friend, right? Doing everything she [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2095.06s)]
*  normally does. She knows her husband is working at least until three, four a.m. And she just [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2101.62s)]
*  doesn't want the burden of the child anymore. Right? So she acts like she's drunk. She puts [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2107.94s)]
*  the kids in bed with her, the kids fall asleep. Then she wakes up, takes her child, and either [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2114.18s)]
*  sells the baby or, you know, makes the child go away. Right? That would be one theory. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2122.34s)]
*  On that theory, she would also have to get out of the house and dispose of the remains and then [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2130.5s)]
*  get back into the bed before Jeremy gets home and sees her at what he said was sleeping. And he [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2136.1s)]
*  believed and you know, and you're the spouse, you can tell when your spouse is legit asleep [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2141.62s)]
*  and whether or not, but keep going. The accident theory is far harder for me to go over because [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2145.06s)]
*  listen, we've all been in that half buzz state, you know, where you go to bed drunk and then you [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2151.7s)]
*  wake up half sober. How do you negotiate that? She wakes up, she finds that she smothered her baby. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2157.06s)]
*  Right? Now I have to get rid of it because I can't face reality. How does she do that within walking [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2164.42s)]
*  distance and have the presence of mind, oh, let me take the phones, let me not be seen. And if my [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2171.7799999999997s)]
*  kids wake up, there are so many variables to that theory. It's very hard for me to pursue that one. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2177.06s)]
*  Far easier for me to go further down the road with she sold the child, which I do not believe. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2185.2999999999997s)]
*  You know, when every new mother knows, they know you don't take your baby in your bed with her, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2193.3799999999997s)]
*  with you. Like it's very dangerous. You can smother your baby inadvertently, but some do it anyway. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2199.8599999999997s)]
*  I mean, some don't know. And then some do know, but they take the risk anyway, [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2205.7s)]
*  because they're exhausted and the child's crying a lot and they just make a mistake. They fall [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2208.74s)]
*  asleep there and one thing leads to one other terrible thing. But the fact that she had her [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2212.74s)]
*  two boys in the bed with her actually, right, Bill? I mean, that just works against that theory. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2218.5s)]
*  Absolutely. Those boys were interviewed and they were old enough to know if their baby sister was [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2225.54s)]
*  in the bed with them. Right? There were just so many different ways that if she did it, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2231.3799999999997s)]
*  she would have gotten caught. Again, these are simple people and I don't mean that in a detrimental [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2239.86s)]
*  sense. They're not master criminals. You know, if someone planned this out, they wouldn't be able [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2244.58s)]
*  to do it. Just too many variables. You know, it was, in my opinion, again, the perfect storm [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2250.02s)]
*  of, you know, Jeremy being away, her being over served, the boys being in the bed, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2257.06s)]
*  you know, for her to roll over on a baby and then get rid of the child, you know, could have done [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2265.62s)]
*  it, but she would have got caught real quick. And then again, just think about the guilt. This isn't [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2271.3799999999997s)]
*  someone that's, you know, a sociopath serial killer, that could kill a person and, you know, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2276.98s)]
*  once a week and then go out in life to stay married with your husband, to look at your children in the [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2283.06s)]
*  eyes, to, you know, the pain that she went through, you know, behind the scenes that we've all saw, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2288.74s)]
*  just doesn't play out to me. No, she's not a sociopath and she continues to talk to us, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2296.66s)]
*  even though, you know, you guys know, I've had many a very tough segment on Debra on my various [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2301.46s)]
*  shows. I just feel like the actual murderer would not keep putting themselves in this harm's way. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2306.5s)]
*  Can we talk about the next door neighbor, Samantha Brando for a minute? Because [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2314.02s)]
*  while we have been unable to reach her, you guys did talk to her. You also put her through the Phil [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2317.78s)]
*  Houston treatment to find out whether it was true, what, that she was sitting with Debra, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2325.3s)]
*  that they were drinking together, that things went down the way Debra said they did? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2331.1400000000003s)]
*  Yeah. And most importantly, she validated the level of intoxication. She said, I hate to say [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2336.9s)]
*  this about Debra, but I don't know if I've ever seen her. And I'm paraphrasing here, but I don't [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2343.14s)]
*  know if I've ever seen her that intoxicated before. There was more wine there than Debra told us [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2349.06s)]
*  originally. Well, that could explain why Debra didn't hear an intruder for sure. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2355.54s)]
*  Well, to your point, Megan, when Jeremy came home, no one heard him come in. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2361.62s)]
*  He was walking around the house. He shut the window. He turned out the lights. He went into [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2366.3399999999997s)]
*  the bedrooms. Didn't wake them up for him either. That's true. So why didn't anyone ever come forward [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2370.82s)]
*  if somebody stole this baby and did something with her? There's not one person who needed [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2379.7000000000003s)]
*  a hundred thousand dollars enough to come forward and quietly say, I know what happened to her. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2386.1800000000003s)]
*  The reason why I think no one has claimed the reward, because it was a sole actor [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2394.5s)]
*  who committed this crime and no one else knows about it. Because to your point, Megan, [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2400.18s)]
*  that's a hundred thousand dollars and they could do right and they could have done it at that time. [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2407.06s)]
*  Now, was the baby sold or something more nefarious? [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2415.46s)]
*  That would explain it if it were a sole actor who then kept his mouth shut. But that's one of the [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2421.78s)]
*  troubling things about this whole thing. If it was anybody who blabbed or if it were a group, [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2428.82s)]
*  somebody would have turned on somebody else and that just hasn't happened. So as it stands at this [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2436.1800000000003s)]
*  point, all eyes are on Deborah. Coming up in our next episode, police continue to bear down on [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F2qZ4vDjk3Q&t=2441.54s)]
