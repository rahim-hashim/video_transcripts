Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Walter Kirn, editor-at-large for "County Highway," to discuss Trump’s historic executive order challenging Big Pharma and outrageous prescription drug prices, how Trump and Bernie Sanders are on the same page based on Bernie's past comments, why other countries in the world are paying reasonable drug prices but the United States has huge upcharges, Big Pharma whining while making billions in profit, why the rest of the world and other countries need to step up now and pay more, how Big Pharma owns so much of the media and political elite, Trump's new potential Air Force One “gift” from Qatar, how the leftist media is using it as a "chew toy" to stay distracted from bigger stories, the market spiking after the Trump administration announced a major temporary trade deal with China, the details of the deal and what it means in the future, Michelle Obama talking about the joys of divorce, her constant negativity about her husband and marriage generally, Halle Berry's inappropriate videos, and more.

# Trump Takes On Big Pharma with Drugs Exec Order, and Michelle Obama's Bitterness, with Walter Kirn
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. I hope everyone out there enjoyed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=0.0s)]
*  their Mother's Day weekend because the news cycle has quickly moved into overdrive. Yes, for those [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4.88s)]
*  of you who listened to AM Update, you are stuck with me for today's podcast, not my three wonderful [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  children who anchored the AM Update today. If you missed it, you missed a treat. It is still [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=17.76s)]
*  available on all of our podcast feeds and on youtube.com. More on that in just a bit. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=23.44s)]
*  It's another day of deals for President Trump. I mean, it's really insane what just happened at [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=30.720000000000002s)]
*  the White House, truly. What just happened with the prescription drugs is earth shattering. We're [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=36.64s)]
*  going to talk about it in just a minute. Also, a sort of trade deal with China. We're going to pause [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=43.6s)]
*  the retaliatory tariffs on one another for 90 days while we work it out, but it seems like they [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=51.12s)]
*  have the framework for a deal. People like Charles Gasparino, who's been defensive of [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=55.36s)]
*  President Trump, saying, look, he had to do this because of the bond markets, because of what was [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=61.599999999999994s)]
*  happening. There's just a trade war with China is not winnable, is what he was saying, given [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=67.03999999999999s)]
*  our economic status right now, our debt and how much we need to service it and so on. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=74.32s)]
*  And so his take on why we have this pause with China was we had to. That smart people went to [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=81.11999999999999s)]
*  Trump and said, you've got to stop this. The United States economy cannot handle it. We need them as [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=87.52s)]
*  badly as they need us. And so the White House is sort of saying, see, I'm playing chess and I'm [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=94.08s)]
*  winning. And smart guys like Charles, who doesn't have TDS, he's a Trump fan, actually, are saying, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=100.4s)]
*  look, the reality is this was not a winnable war. So whatever, it's good that it's paused. That's [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=106.32000000000001s)]
*  his take for what it's worth. Also, I mentioned this new executive order on prescription drug [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=112.08000000000001s)]
*  prices. I'm going to get to that. A deal to release the last American hostage in Gaza. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=117.52000000000001s)]
*  He's got dual citizenship, American and Israeli, and he's coming home, Trump said he thinks, [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=122.64000000000001s)]
*  today. And then there's this issue of an Air Force One gift, which he spoke to Trump did when [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=127.68s)]
*  he had a presser this morning at nine thirty. We're going to get into all of it. Joining me [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=134.24s)]
*  for the full show today, Walter Kern, editor at large for County Highway and cohost of the America [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=137.52s)]
*  This Week podcast. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=146.08s)]
*  Facebook and X. If you haven't heard about Riverbend Ranch, it's time you did. They have [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=153.84s)]
*  just introduced their Riverbend Ranch steaks to the marketplace. Riverbend Ranch raises their beef on [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=158.8s)]
*  beautiful mountain meadows only a few miles from West Yellowstone. Unlike most ranches, Riverbed [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=164.56s)]
*  Ranch never uses growth hormones or antibiotics. They treat their animals humanely and with respect. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=169.6s)]
*  There are advantages of buying directly from the ranch. They can track the health of every animal [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=176.64000000000001s)]
*  from the day it is born and can guarantee that it has been healthy every day of its life. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=180.88s)]
*  Riverbend Ranch has its own state of the art processing facility on the ranch that has [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=185.84s)]
*  received several national awards as one of the best in the U.S. But most important is the quality [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=190.24s)]
*  of the beef. They age their beef to perfection for 21 days. You simply cannot buy beef like this in a [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=195.2s)]
*  grocery store. Shipped directly from the ranch to your home, you get a much better price than [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=200.8s)]
*  going through the middleman. Order directly from RiverbendRanch.com. Use promo code MEGAN to get [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=205.28s)]
*  20 bucks off your first order. That's RiverbendRanch.com code MEGAN and be prepared. Once you taste it, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=211.44s)]
*  I think you're going to be coming back for more. Again, that's RiverbendRanch.com code MEGAN. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=219.04s)]
*  Walter, welcome back to the show. Great to have you. It's great to be here. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=225.6s)]
*  Okay, so let's start with this prescription drug thing because [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  this is huge. Like this one's actually really big. Just as a way of history for those who [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  haven't been following this, Trump in his first term tried to take this on. The fact that Big Pharma [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=240.72s)]
*  won't negotiate with our government, our government won't negotiate with Big Pharma to protect us on [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=249.52s)]
*  the prices that we have to pay. Trump tried to do it and got sued. He tried to do it just with [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=254.48s)]
*  respect to Medicare. He got sued by Big Pharma and he lost because technically it's Congress's job [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=261.12s)]
*  to negotiate these prices. It's a question of constitutional authority. Big Pharma sued, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=267.92s)]
*  saying you don't have the authority as president to do an end around Congress. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=274.32s)]
*  They won because of separations of powers. Big Pharma doesn't give a shit about separation of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=278.48s)]
*  powers. Big Pharma wants to charge us a lot of money, but they used the constitution to shut [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=283.28s)]
*  down Trump's effort in term one. Then comes Joe Biden. Okay, so now there was an attempt, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=288.15999999999997s)]
*  and this one was successful, to make us negotiate on, I think it was first eight and then it was 10 [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=294.71999999999997s)]
*  drugs for Medicare only. So the government could negotiate with Big Pharma on these now 10 drugs. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=301.28s)]
*  That's it out of the universe of drugs. It's not a lot and it's only under Medicare. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=307.92s)]
*  Now Trump comes in, and by the way, this has always been more of like a Democrat thing and [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=314.88s)]
*  Republicans have more, well, I mean, they've both been in the pocket of Big Pharma to be honest. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=318.56s)]
*  Both sides are totally in the damn pocket of Big Pharma. We don't hate Big Pharma. Big Pharma comes [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=322.08000000000004s)]
*  up with drugs that can help us not die. They come up with miracle drugs like Ozempic, which is [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=327.52000000000004s)]
*  helping a lot of very, very obese people get down to much more healthy weights. So it's not to [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=334.32s)]
*  demonize Big Pharma, but they're also disgusting. They're disgusting in so many ways. They're [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=339.44s)]
*  absolute pigs when it comes to exploiting, especially the American consumer. And Anna [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=345.6s)]
*  Kasparian, who's with the Young Turks, she's a Democrat, she's a liberal, she's great, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=351.44s)]
*  she's very reasonable. She's been on this program a number of times, and this has been one of her [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=357.28000000000003s)]
*  main issues. She's the one who first got my attention on it, trying to say, what the F? [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=361.84s)]
*  Why aren't we doing this? Why aren't we, as a government, more protective of our own people? [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=367.11999999999995s)]
*  And why are we allowing Big Pharma to charge Americans $1,000 a month for some drugs that [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=372.08s)]
*  the same manufacturers charge people in Denmark $50 a month for? So the same drug, you could be [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  paying $50 for it if you live in Denmark, and you could pay $1,000 for it if you live in the United [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=389.92s)]
*  States. And do we have Anna Cutt? She was going off on this. Okay. In any event, she was showing [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=396.40000000000003s)]
*  the bullet points in particular on Ozempic. And I realized that's a very popular drug, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=406.72s)]
*  but you could do this with a lot of other drugs where you go around the world. And we, the suckers [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=412.48s)]
*  in America, are subsidizing the world's cheap use of these drugs. And it's bullshit. She played a [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=418.48s)]
*  soundbite of Bernie Sanders. And as you know, Bernie and Trump kind of are at the horseshoe ends of the [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=426.08000000000004s)]
*  same ideological spectrum. Trump got there from the right, Bernie got there from the left, and they [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=431.6s)]
*  wound up kind of close to each other in a number of issues. And the crossover amongst fans is kind [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=437.28000000000003s)]
*  of interesting with those two. She played this Bernie soundbite where he was asked, because he's [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=442.16s)]
*  been pushing for the ability for us to negotiate on drug costs for a while, where he was asked by an [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=447.28s)]
*  MSNBC anchor about it. Watch. Why does Novo Nordis, in your opinion, charge so much more for Americans [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=451.84s)]
*  to get this drug? I know exactly why, as so does everybody else. Throughout the entire world, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=461.11999999999995s)]
*  there are national health programs, which by the way, in most cases, guarantee health care to all [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=468.0s)]
*  of their people. And they sit down and they negotiate with the drug companies. And they say, [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=473.44s)]
*  you know what, you can't charge us any price you want. Let's sit down and talk about a reasonable [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=479.84s)]
*  price. Here in the United States, until last year, you had the insane situation where the drug [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=485.12s)]
*  companies could charge any price they wanted for any reason. Second of all, let's not kid ourselves. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=492.15999999999997s)]
*  The pharmaceutical industry is enormously powerful. They have over 1800 well-paid lobbyists [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=499.84s)]
*  in Washington, D.C. Right now, former leaders of the Republican Party, the Democratic Party, [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=509.12s)]
*  they're very nonpartisan. They will give money to anybody. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=514.48s)]
*  Okay. Here's just to put some more meat on those bones, Walter. She was showing a map that she [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=520.24s)]
*  was from the MSNBC segment with Bernie on this, just for the example, Ozempic. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=526.72s)]
*  That costs about $1,000 per month in the United States before insurance. In Canada, it goes for [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=533.28s)]
*  $147. $59 in Germany, $96 in Sweden, $103 in the Netherlands, $144 in Switzerland, $83 in France. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=538.3199999999999s)]
*  Why do the Americans have to pay $1,000 for the exact same drug that she points out [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=549.4399999999999s)]
*  can be manufactured for less than $5 a month per a study performed by Yale and King's College [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=558.3199999999999s)]
*  Hospital in London? This is what Trump is trying to get at with this extraordinary executive order. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=566.64s)]
*  He now says on all drugs, not just Medicare, we're going to start negotiating. We're not going to be [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=573.36s)]
*  the world's piggy bank where they make all their money in the United States and then sell it cheaply [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=579.76s)]
*  to everybody else. He says this could save people up to 80% on their drug costs. Number one, there's [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=584.64s)]
*  likely to be another lawsuit by Big Pharma saying this is an inappropriate end around Congress. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=594.0s)]
*  And number two, it'll be really interesting to see how the Democrats [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=599.28s)]
*  react to Donald Trump pushing this kind of Bernie-blessed program when it comes to [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=603.6s)]
*  pharmaceuticals. There you go. You take it, Walter. Is this a country of politics or a country of [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=610.72s)]
*  issues? Because in this case, Bernie and Trump agree, and Bernie has been loud on this matter [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=616.0s)]

*  because they're going to need it against the greatest lobby in American life next to the, [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=627.92s)]
*  I suppose, military industrial complex. The fact is that drugs like Azempik, and this one in [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=632.9599999999999s)]
*  particular, are not that complex. It's a peptide called semaglutide. It can be bought cheaply as [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=639.36s)]
*  the peptide itself. In its patented drug form, it's made more expensive. But the excuse that [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=646.56s)]
*  the U.S. has to pay higher prices, vastly higher prices, in order to subsidize the research and [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=653.28s)]
*  development of these drugs so that the rest of the world can benefit from lower prices [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=659.68s)]
*  is ridiculous. But it has been the fig leaf, the massive fig leaf that they have used to cover [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=665.04s)]
*  their profiteering for decades. Really, under Obamacare, there was a real conspicuous emission [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=670.4s)]
*  because the supposed aim of the bill, of the legislation, was to lower prices for American [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=679.6s)]
*  health care. But it did not include negotiation with drug companies for lower prices. Everybody [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=686.96s)]
*  noticed that at the time, that carve out, as it were. Now Trump's ending it. Frankly, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=695.12s)]
*  this is a demolition job on mere partisanship because, just as you quoted the young Turks [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=700.8s)]
*  person, if we can't get together on this, then we can't get together on anything. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=708.4s)]
*  Yes. So what's been happening in Congress is they're bought and paid for. I mean, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=714.16s)]
*  that's really the bottom line. Big Pharma, as the audience knows and experienced firsthand during [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=719.36s)]
*  COVID with Pfizer, it owns the U.S. Congress. They make tons of money and then they buy [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=723.84s)]
*  congressmen and women so that they won't do anything to change the piggy bank system. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=732.56s)]
*  And they don't. Neither side is innocent. Megan, you and I both attended the RFK Jr. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=739.28s)]
*  confirmation hearings, I happen to know. I was only one row away from you. And I think we saw [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=746.4s)]
*  there both Bernie and Elizabeth Warren hectoring the man who wanted to pressure Big Pharma and [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=754.16s)]
*  challenge them on all sorts of fronts, from the effectiveness of their drugs to testing [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=761.92s)]
*  drugs like the vaccines and so on and prices. And they were acting like they were lawyers for Pfizer. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=767.52s)]
*  Well, everybody's a lawyer for Pfizer if they're getting paid by them. And I'm afraid Bernie, [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=775.12s)]
*  he makes it a little complicated, gets a lot of money from them. He gets it from their employees [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=780.56s)]
*  and he claims that he gets it one little bit at a time and it doesn't represent management [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=786.8s)]
*  contributing to his cause. But it's a massive set of donations to him and to the Democrats. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=792.24s)]
*  And he can prove his independence, if he'd like, by coming together with Trump. And if they think [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=800.7199999999999s)]
*  there are some problems with this executive order or the particular way that it's going to happen, [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=807.28s)]
*  that's fine. But the principle has been agreed on, as you say, by the horseshoe for a while. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=812.32s)]
*  So it's time to do something for the American people. We must transcend TDS in certain cases. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=818.0s)]
*  I wish we did in most cases or all. But if we can't do it here, I don't know where we're going to [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=825.2s)]
*  start. Yeah. Yeah. So Bernie is there, you know, he's in Congress, obviously, he's a sitting US [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=830.88s)]
*  senator, but good luck convincing your fellow congressmen to actually do this once and for all. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=838.56s)]
*  And that's the reason why Trump tried to do an end around the do nothing Congress, because he [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=844.2399999999999s)]
*  isn't bought and paid for by big pharma, but failed because the court said, sorry, sir, this is not [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=848.9599999999999s)]
*  within your remit. But today, Trump spoke to that at the end, he had a presser at 930, talking about [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=854.64s)]
*  this and the Chinese deal. And it was at this presser that he signed the executive order and [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=861.4399999999999s)]
*  he had his health team with him, Jay Bhattacharya of NIH, Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. of HHS, [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=866.64s)]
*  Mehmet Oz of Medicare, obviously, he's going to be involved in this too. And I think Marty McCurry [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=873.12s)]
*  was there of FDA. So Trump got up there and said, basically, I dare you, I dare you now Democrats [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=878.08s)]
*  in Congress to defy me on this. So Trump seems pretty clear. I'm sure he's been told you tried [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=886.08s)]
*  this in Trump 1.0 and you got sued successfully as you don't have this executive power. Because [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=892.48s)]
*  once again, he's using executive power, which is probably going to get stopped by a court just as [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=898.16s)]
*  soon as big pharma files a lawsuit. But Trump's already baking that in saying, I dare the Democrats [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=902.5600000000001s)]
*  in Congress to not pass this in the big, beautiful bill that they're working on right now, the big [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=909.76s)]
*  money bill that's going to raise taxes or lower taxes or whatever they're working it out. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=916.88s)]
*  Because he said, how are you going to look at your constituents and say, you finally had the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=920.88s)]
*  chance in legislation that would have Republican support in the Congress and the support of the [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=926.0799999999999s)]
*  sitting president ready to sign it to finally give the government this power to negotiate on the [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=932.4s)]
*  drug prices. And you refused to do it, which is very clever to put this in the big, beautiful [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=938.16s)]
*  bill and frame it that way. Well, it's not only clever, it's absolutely essential in a time of [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=946.24s)]
*  budget cutting, particularly to do something like this, because the biggest client, the biggest [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=953.52s)]
*  patient in the United States, so to speak, is the United States government. It's the taxpayer who [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=959.36s)]
*  pays for these drugs in so many cases, through all kinds of programs. And it's going to save [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=965.8399999999999s)]
*  us collectively a lot of money and individually, you know, untold amount of money in family budgets. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=972.64s)]
*  I just think that it was time that Trump really held their feet to the fire on the social issues [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=980.88s)]
*  and the populist programs that they claim to support. And I think it's a masterstroke. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=987.1199999999999s)]
*  I did a little reporting on it last night. They've kept it very close. We were all taken by surprise. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=996.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm shocked that it didn't leak. And pharma's counterattack is going to be interesting because [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1002.56s)]
*  it will be somewhat deceptive. Already, they're trying to argue that somehow this is a blow [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1008.16s)]
*  against the Third World, which will no longer have the benefit of our subsidized drug research. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1013.68s)]
*  And I've even seen people say, well, they're trying to solve immigration by killing all the [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1021.1999999999999s)]
*  people that would immigrate here. I mean, it's going to be hysterical like you haven't seen. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1026.24s)]
*  Meanwhile, it's like the Democrats are the ones who claim that they've been for this. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1034.4s)]
*  So let's see. I mean, Robert Kennedy, RFKJ, got out there today and was, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1039.92s)]
*  he seemed genuinely stunned. I mean, he knew it was coming, obviously, but I think even he [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1045.04s)]
*  didn't have hopes this high that Trump would do something like this. Here he was earlier this [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1050.16s)]
*  morning, Sat. 2. This was the fulcrum of Bernie Sanders runs for presidency, that he was going to [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1053.6s)]
*  eliminate this discrepancy. And it's one of these promises that politicians make to their constituents [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1060.3999999999999s)]
*  knowing that they'll never have to do it, as they know that Congress is controlled in so many ways [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1067.4399999999998s)]
*  by the pharmaceutical industry. Because we now have a president who is a man of his word, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1073.12s)]
*  who has the courage. President Trump was taking money from the pharmaceutical industry, too. I [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1080.64s)]
*  think they gave you $100 million. But he can't be bought. There's writers like Elizabeth Warren or [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1085.8400000000001s)]
*  Robert Reich, who are saying that President Trump is on this side of the Olic arcs. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1093.76s)]
*  There has never been a president more willing to stand up to the Olic arcs. I never thought that [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1098.5600000000002s)]
*  this would happen in my lifetime. I have a couple of kids who are Democrats, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1104.88s)]
*  are big Bernie Sanders fans. And when I told them that this was going to happen, they had tears in [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1110.64s)]
*  their eyes. Wow. Frankly, I have tears in my eyes, not this moment, but I did, because I'll tell you [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1116.5600000000002s)]
*  why. The price of drugs, especially drugs that are for limited or small diseases that don't create [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1126.16s)]
*  a big market where the cost can't be spread across a lot of patients, can be absolutely ruinous. You [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1136.0s)]
*  see $1,000 of prescription. Let's talk $200,000. I mean, there are drugs for things like hepatitis [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1142.72s)]
*  and for various cancers and so on that are shocking. They're a Rolls Royce. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1150.48s)]
*  We're going to change lives here. We're going to prevent families from going into bankruptcy. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1158.48s)]
*  We're going to cut the budget. And lastly, there has been talk about pharma ads on TV. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1162.64s)]
*  It is not just Congress that pharma controls, Megan. It's MSNBC and CNN and Fox and the other [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1170.72s)]
*  cable news networks that we're all familiar with through carrying about 70% of the weight with [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1177.2s)]
*  their advertising in some cases. Now that influence totally deformed our COVID response and maybe [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1184.16s)]
*  guided it to some extent, if you really want to be serious about it. That influence is gone. You [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1192.0s)]
*  can't advertise if you don't have the money. And that money, that big giant pot of profits that was [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1198.8s)]
*  on a $5 drug, $995 dose or whatever, is not going to be poured into these influence operations [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1205.36s)]
*  going forward, except in the short term, because there's no way they want this to come to pass. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1217.36s)]
*  That's right. So the executive order, I'll just read a bit from the beginning of it. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1223.9199999999998s)]
*  He says, it says purpose. The US has less than 5% of the world's population and yet funds around [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1230.8s)]
*  three quarters of global pharmaceutical profits. This egregious imbalance is orchestrated through [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1237.36s)]
*  a purposeful scheme in which drug manufacturers deeply discount their products to access foreign [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1244.1599999999999s)]
*  markets and subsidize that decrease through enormously high prices in the USA. The US has [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1249.76s)]
*  for too long turned its back on Americans who unwittingly sponsor both drug manufacturers and [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1256.32s)]
*  other countries. These entities today rely on price markups on American consumers, generous public [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1261.9199999999998s)]
*  subsidies for research and development, primarily through the NIH and robust public financing of [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1268.24s)]
*  prescription drug consumption through the federal and state healthcare programs. Drug manufacturers, [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1275.76s)]
*  rather than seeking to equalize evident price discrimination, agree to other countries' demands [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1280.8799999999999s)]
*  for low prices and simultaneously fight against the ability for public and private payers in the [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1285.76s)]
*  US to negotiate the best prices for patients. The inflated prices in the US fuel global innovation [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1290.0s)]
*  while foreign health systems get a free ride. This abuse of Americans' generosity, who deserve [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1296.32s)]
*  low cost pharmaceuticals on the same terms as other developed nations, must end. Americans will [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1303.28s)]
*  no longer be forced to pay almost three times more for the exact same medications often made [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1309.12s)]
*  in the exact same factories. As the largest purchaser of pharmaceuticals, Americans should [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1314.8s)]
*  get the best deal. And while I need to pour over this thing more closely, because it's [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1320.8s)]
*  several pages long, single spaced and pretty dense, he's saying that he's addressing [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1325.52s)]
*  Kennedy and Medicare, which would be Dr. Oz, to negotiate with the drug companies saying, [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1333.76s)]
*  you better give us. Again, just to stay on the Ozempic, because it's easy to understand. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1342.48s)]
*  You're charging Germans $59 for that drug, because this is by Novo Nordisk, which is a [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1348.4s)]
*  company from Denmark. Novo, you're charging Germans $59 for this medication and you're [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1355.76s)]
*  charging Americans $1,000. It's a no. And to start the negotiation with them directly, [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1363.8400000000001s)]
*  we are not going to allow you to charge that in the United States. And then this thing also says, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1370.64s)]
*  and if you cannot reach a new agreement, then there's going to be basically a price set by [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1376.72s)]
*  the United States without your buy-in. That's what his executive order says. We'll try to work it out [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1384.0800000000002s)]
*  with you. If you don't want to strike a deal, we'll just do it. So it's in your interest to strike a [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1389.68s)]
*  deal with us. Again, this will be subject to a legal challenge. Go ahead, Walter. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1394.0800000000002s)]
*  Well, here's a case of a non-American company, a Danish company, that's stiffing the United States, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1398.16s)]
*  but not the country next door, Germany. Why is that? It's because- [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1403.92s)]
*  And they're not poor and developing. They've got plenty of money. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1409.04s)]
*  Well, but Megan, they have been acting poor and developing almost since World War II. And for a [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1412.56s)]
*  while they were. They were devastated by war for several decades and trying to get back on their [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1417.76s)]
*  feet. But the truth is we have been subsidizing European socialized medical programs. In other [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1424.24s)]
*  words, and in so many ways we've been doing that, our military payments and our undue support of NATO [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1432.32s)]
*  has allowed them to not have militaries of their own and pour money into social programs. The [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1439.36s)]
*  social programs themselves have been subsidized in ways like this, where they negotiate, they get [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1446.32s)]
*  good prices from companies and we don't. In other words, we're carrying the weight for the world. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1452.88s)]
*  And in this case, it has nothing to do with development. The recent development isn't going [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1458.5600000000002s)]
*  on in the United States. We're simply paying for it. Now, how they got that deal and through what [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1464.96s)]
*  influence is something we should investigate later, but that it should go on is something [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1472.0s)]
*  we need to deal with yesterday. Yeah. Okay. So staying on the weight loss drug, because it's [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1478.64s)]
*  just easy to understand. So the defense by Big Pharma is always, we spend so much money on [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1484.64s)]
*  research and development. You can't start pinching us on the profits because they go not only to just [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1492.4s)]
*  our bottom line, but they are a reward for the billions in R&D that went into developing these [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1499.6000000000001s)]
*  drugs. And here's the numbers. But they can still have their profits, Megan. It's just that the [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1506.16s)]
*  subsidies for them will be more evenly distributed between countries and customers. That's right. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1512.72s)]
*  Okay. So here's what they say, that Novo Nordisk, they declined to provide production costs for [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1517.76s)]
*  Ozempic and its weight loss drug counterpart, Wegovi. But the Danish drug maker noted that it [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1523.52s)]
*  spent almost $5 billion on R&D last year and will spend more than $6 billion on a recent [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1530.32s)]
*  deal to boost manufacturing to meet the demand for these drugs. So they're crying that they have to [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1536.48s)]
*  manufacture. It's in such demand that they have to pay $6 billion to develop even more of it. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1542.96s)]
*  No one's crying any tears for you over that. But they're crying about the $5 billion that they took [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1548.56s)]
*  to develop it. However, their profits for 2023 and 2024 equal, no, for one year, it's one year, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1553.68s)]
*  one year operating profit. I think it was either 2023 or 2024 was equivalent to $15 billion US. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1563.6000000000001s)]
*  Their largest profit since 1989. So they profited in one year, $15 billion, largely off of that [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1575.04s)]
*  drug. And they want us to cry and pay $1,000 a month because it cost them $5 billion to develop [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1582.72s)]
*  it. It all has to fall on the Americans. And we're supposed to feel sorry for the drug company. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1589.44s)]
*  That's only going to net what, like $8 billion instead of $15 billion if they charge us a fair [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1594.0s)]
*  price versus everybody else. Listen, I don't understand why they're still paying development [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1600.24s)]
*  costs and research costs on a drug that they've already developed. And frankly, which is a rather [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1607.3600000000001s)]
*  simple substance compound. And as far as manufacturing and gearing up to make more of it [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1612.24s)]
*  because of overwhelming demand, well, what other industry tells you that in order for us to gear [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1620.4s)]
*  up to meet the demand, we need crazy, almost unlimited ability to charge you? If Ford had a [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1628.0s)]
*  hit car and it said, we've got to build new factories to turn out the number of cars that [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1637.76s)]
*  people want to buy. And we've got to keep those prices really high in order to do that. That's [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1644.4s)]
*  the opposite of what I just heard. Isn't there something called economies of scale? The more you [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1650.0s)]
*  sell, the cheaper and the more you have to make, the cheaper it is to manufacture each unit? [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1654.64s)]
*  Yes. So here's Dr. Jay Bhattacharya talking about how they're not anti-drug company. [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1663.04s)]
*  They understand it's an important industry in the United States and to the American people. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1669.28s)]
*  And he runs NIH. Here's what he had to say. What we're going to do is make sure that those prices [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1674.24s)]
*  become much closer to equal, like a competitive market you'd expect. Right now what's happening [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1681.28s)]
*  is the American people are subsidizing in large fraction the research and development efforts [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1687.04s)]
*  for drug companies around the world by the higher prices that we pay. With this new order, [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1693.76s)]
*  Europe will share the burden of that. And in fact, if you may think of it as somehow it's [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1700.72s)]
*  going after drug companies, actually it's helping drug companies. Because what we're also going to [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1707.04s)]
*  do with this order, what President Trump has done with this order, is he's said to European [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1711.36s)]
*  governments, look, if you are taking advantage of the drug companies by forcing them to [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1716.6399999999999s)]
*  charge very, very low prices, we're going to defend American drug companies. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1721.12s)]
*  And that, I think, Walter, is why the pharma stocks went up after Trump's presser. Dr. Bhattacharya [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1726.9599999999998s)]
*  explained that and Trump explained it too, which was if these foreign countries continue, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1736.48s)]
*  that can afford these drugs at a higher level, continue to act like they're paupers and not pay [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1742.4s)]
*  at least the American drug companies a fair price for the drugs, then I don't know what Trump's [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1748.72s)]
*  going to do, tear off them? He's going to do something to try to exact a penalty on these [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1754.16s)]
*  countries that have deep pockets but have been grifting off of us for too long. And [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1761.1200000000001s)]
*  that's why I was watching CNBC this morning, something I very rarely do. And the big pharma [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1766.0s)]
*  stocks were down, then Trump held his presser and immediately they all started to climb, [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1771.36s)]
*  because I think they heard that there is some measure of comfort being built in there, at [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1776.16s)]
*  least for the American big pharma companies. Let me launch a rather elaborate metaphor, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1781.12s)]
*  but a colorful one. The United States is like a member of a family who hits it big in Hollywood, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1788.32s)]
*  and they suddenly become rich and they have a big house and money coming in. And all of a sudden, [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1795.1999999999998s)]
*  all the relatives say, hey man, can you help me with my car payment? Hey, my son just got sick, [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1801.36s)]
*  can you help with his hospital bills? And then after a while that arrangement becomes [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1807.84s)]
*  institutionalized. Meanwhile, all the greedy relatives are doing quite well, but they decide [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1813.12s)]
*  we have to cry poor in order to keep living off our movie star cousin. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1818.88s)]
*  At this point, the movie star is about to lose his mansion. He's mortgaged it 10 times and he's [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1825.2s)]
*  got problems of his own and it's time for the rest of the family to step up. If we go down to [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1832.5600000000002s)]
*  paying 400 per dose and they go up from 90 to paying 400, the pharmaceutical company actually [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1840.96s)]
*  hasn't lost. It can go do its precious development and research all day long. But what's happened is [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1848.56s)]
*  that there is once again, some sort of fairness in the family. I love that. That is so good. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1855.3600000000001s)]
*  I've got it. I love that analogies. They help me understand. Here's Trump trying to explain [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1863.04s)]
*  the weight loss drug disparity because that one's just so obvious. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1870.08s)]
*  And in a way that only Trump can take a listen to Sat One. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1873.76s)]
*  I mean, I'll tell you a story. A friend of mine who's a businessman, very, very, very top guy. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1877.12s)]
*  Most of you would have heard of him. A highly neurotic, brilliant businessman, seriously [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1883.6799999999998s)]
*  overweight. And he takes the fat shot drug. And he called me up and he said, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1890.08s)]
*  President, he used to call me Donald. Now he calls me President. So that's nice respect. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1900.0s)]
*  But he's a rough guy, smart guy, very successful, very rich. I wouldn't even know how we would know [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1904.32s)]
*  this, but because he's got... Very fast. President, could I ask you a question or what? I'm in London [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1910.72s)]
*  and I just paid for this damn fat drug I take. I said, it's not working. He said, [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1916.24s)]
*  I just paid $88 and in New York I pay $1,300. What the hell is going on? [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1924.8799999999999s)]
*  Only Trump. Only Trump, Walter. Is he going to go on Broadway after he finishes his presidency? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1935.04s)]
*  Because I saw Jackie Mason on Broadway back when and he had nothing on Trump. This story, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1941.28s)]
*  but this storytelling side of him is really effective. Just like I just tried to use a [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1948.8799999999999s)]
*  colorful story to explain things. Trump, from no tax on tips to other policies, often seems to come [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1953.44s)]
*  to his brilliant, uncontroversial, outrageous ideas by talking to people who are affected by the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1962.08s)]
*  policies. Oh my Lord, what a revolutionary way to do politics and to research policy, not go through [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1969.28s)]
*  a $10 billion think tank, but ask the waitress if she gets to tax too much on her tips. That's right. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1978.8s)]
*  Or ask his very fat friend who's on the fat drug, the fat shot. He's on the fat shot. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1985.92s)]
*  What I love is that embedded in that, Megan, is he took a shot at the drug itself. He said, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1991.52s)]
*  it's not working. It's not working. It's amazing. Here's the other thing. Now, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=1997.12s)]
*  it's going to be very interesting this week to see how this plays out because this is not one of [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2005.12s)]
*  those things that the sides are going to immediately know, the sides that don't think for themselves, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2012.08s)]
*  how to handle it. Normally it's like, well, the Republicans are against, quote, price [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2019.04s)]
*  controls, which Trump denies that that's what this is. And so they would normally bash somebody [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2026.8s)]
*  in this position. They would definitely bash a Bernie Sanders type, but it's Trump. So what [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2032.0s)]
*  are they going to do? And then the Democrats would normally be in favor of something like, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2036.08s)]
*  Bernie Sanders, how will he go over to the White House? Will he say, I applaud him and I applaud [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2039.2s)]
*  this? Or will his TDS win out where he just can't support this because it was suggested by Trump? [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2043.84s)]
*  And same for the media, right? The media should like this because they're left leaning. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2050.72s)]
*  They should want something like this. But not only is it Trump, but they are controlled by [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2056.56s)]
*  Big Pharma. That's who's paying all of their million dollar salaries. Just give you one example. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2063.2799999999997s)]
*  Who could forget Stephen Colbert during the COVID nightmare with this little bit on his show. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2069.12s)]
*  He's dancing with people dressed like the shot [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2081.12s)]
*  and tons of little cartoon shots and a graphic that reads the Vax, V-A-X, scene, S-C-E-N-A. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2090.16s)]
*  Oh my God. Okay. I've seen enough. And he should be dancing because they made him a very rich man. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2103.44s)]
*  That's a cross between Cabaret and the Hunger Games, what we just saw there. That is truly a man [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2110.1600000000003s)]
*  singing for his supper and his supper is provided by Pfizer. And if you go over to the actual news [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2116.6400000000003s)]
*  channels, right up in the corner, it will say sponsored by Pfizer. You know, the COVID death [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  count sponsored by Pfizer. Anderson Cooper is not going to like this. Rachel Maddow is not going to [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2129.6s)]
*  like this. None of those people, but they're going to have to be very creative in finding a way to [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2135.12s)]
*  question it or oppose it. So I make a prediction. At first they'll try to have their cake and eat it [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2140.48s)]
*  too. They'll applaud the sentiment, the goal, the idea in general, but they'll tell us the execution [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2145.92s)]
*  is terrible and is going to lead to disastrous consequences for the very poorest among us. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2153.12s)]
*  I mean, especially they'll set the damage in places you and I won't ever go, you know, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2158.88s)]
*  East Africa and so on and tell us over there it's just, you know, wreaking devastation. But the [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2164.64s)]
*  fact is that finally they're going to have to come down on one side or the other, especially the [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2171.52s)]
*  politicians. And they're going to come down on Farmer's side if that's who's supporting them. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2176.8799999999997s)]
*  I mean, this is a kill shot against the rhetorical hypocrisy of Democrats and Republicans who [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2181.92s)]
*  always can be for something that will never happen. It's easy to be for lower drug prices [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2191.44s)]
*  when you happen to know from the meetings back at your office with the Merck president that it's [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2197.52s)]
*  never going to happen. Now it happened. Big Pharma hasn't said anything yet. They've been [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2202.96s)]
*  quiet all morning. I'm sure they're getting their next move in line. And I think it's going to be [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2209.2000000000003s)]
*  closing themselves in patriotism. Like this is very sad, but it's beyond the president's authority. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2217.12s)]
*  And we believe in separation of powers. And, you know, he just can't do this. We've already [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2224.0s)]
*  obtained a court decision saying this is outside of his, you know, his power. So sadly, we're going [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2228.7999999999997s)]
*  to have to sue him again. We'd love to lower prices for Americans, but the constitution won't allow [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2235.04s)]
*  us. So just shoot me. It's not going to work this time. This is a slightly different deal, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2240.48s)]
*  too, Megan. This isn't exactly what he tried before. This has to do with other organizations [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2247.92s)]
*  that set drug prices, these intermediaries that raise the price. It's a little bit subtler and [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2254.32s)]
*  it's more gamed out than it was before. I think you're right. They definitely learned from Trump [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2263.2000000000003s)]
*  point point. Oh, we've seen that on the immigration front and have no reason to doubt it on this front [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2269.84s)]
*  as well. So it'll be really fun over the next coming days to watch where things settle. OK, [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2274.56s)]
*  let's talk about the Trump plane, which is interesting. Now, this one is also a little [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2279.84s)]
*  complicated. If you listen to AM update, you know about this story because the Kelly Brunt children [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2286.48s)]
*  told you all about it. Let me just explain what that means for Mother's Day. My three children [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2296.0s)]
*  read my script for AM update, the morning news headline podcast that we put out on our feed. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2301.12s)]
*  It's a 15 minute news update to get you started in case you guys have not yet listened to it. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2306.56s)]
*  I think you'd enjoy it. I think you'd especially enjoy it today where the three children, [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2311.12s)]
*  Yates, 15, Yardley, 14 and Thatcher, 11, read the news of the day. I edited the script along with [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2315.52s)]
*  my producer, Julia, and then they tracked it and it was so fun. They did it so that I wouldn't have [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2322.8s)]
*  to do it. Although truth be told, I was there for most of their tracking and we had so much fun. It [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2328.88s)]
*  was hilarious. And we decided for people who listened to it and loved it because the feedback's [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2332.96s)]
*  been so fun online. Thank you all for commenting that it might be fun to play some of the outtakes, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2338.7200000000003s)]
*  some of the some of the bloopers, including the moment you will hear it here, where a B [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2343.28s)]
*  invaded the studio and there was an errant attempt to kill it while it was still flying, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2349.8399999999997s)]
*  which, you know, never really works out. But take a listen to some of the outtakes here. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2355.6s)]
*  Good morning, everyone. Hold on. It's kind of late. I'll do it. The mayor of Newark arrested [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2361.44s)]
*  amid a clash between ICE officials and Democrat lawmakers with DHS saying more. Sorry, there's [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2368.96s)]
*  a really big B. Oh, my God. It's a yellow jacket. Yellow jackets are the ones that stick you out. [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2376.96s)]
*  Since being chosen to head the Catholic Church, the pope calling for peace around the world, [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  saying we are facing the tragedy of a quote, Third World War. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2402.16s)]
*  And on all podcast platforms. Good job. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2411.2799999999997s)]
*  Gates, can you not do that? Southern normal kids. There's some back and forth and they had a couple [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2418.24s)]
*  of stumbles, but not many. My favorite. It didn't make the real, but it was when my little guy was [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2426.96s)]
*  reading a story about the pope and said something like the papal vestments. We redid it and did [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2431.28s)]
*  papal. But he I'll tell you, they nailed it. They understood the pronunciations and I was very proud [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2437.52s)]
*  of them and I appreciated their sweet. One of their Mother's Day gifts. They also gave me a [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2441.6800000000003s)]
*  baseball cap that reads Gulf of America right on and a big cozy like snuggie because I'm always [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2446.32s)]
*  cold and also a mug that reads astronaut, which they understand I am. And listeners of the show [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2454.16s)]
*  know what I mean. So that's a long way of getting into the Trump airplane saga. So Walter Trump has [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2462.0s)]
*  been offered a $400 million 747 by the Qataris and the thing looks sick. I have to say the pictures [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2469.52s)]
*  online make it look like spectacular. I mean, it's so wide. I'm like, can this thing fly the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2479.44s)]
*  living room and it looks like something out of a skyscraper living room, which I guess this is the [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2486.16s)]
*  ultimate skyscraper. Yeah. Here's some of the pictures. Trump went and took a look at this jet [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2491.68s)]
*  and it was to his liking apparently and says, I'd love it. Now at first that does sound terrible [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2497.76s)]
*  that our president will be taking a $400 million gift from the Qataris because there is something [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2505.92s)]
*  under the constitution called the emoluments clause and we're not allowed our any official [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2510.5600000000004s)]
*  in a position of public trust is not allowed to take a gift. They're really, they're not allowed [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2515.28s)]
*  to, but Pam Bondi has said he can get around that because this isn't a gift to Trump. It's a gift [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2519.6000000000004s)]
*  to our Pentagon. And then when the refurbished air force ones that [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2526.32s)]
*  Boeing has been working on for 10 years are finally done 10 years from now, this [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2534.0800000000004s)]
*  Qatari plane will be gifted to the Trump presidential library. So it's not a gift [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2541.04s)]
*  and an emolument, which is that's when you perform a service for a fee. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2548.56s)]
*  Sure. Pam Bondi saying that's not this because he's not performing any service for the Qataris. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2553.52s)]
*  This is a gift. So, and it doesn't, and it's not to a person anyway, this is going to be a fight [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2558.08s)]
*  legally. Someone's going to file lawsuits and the Qataris are saying it's not yet settled. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2564.0s)]
*  Both sides, legal departments are looking into whether this can fly, so to speak. But Trump's [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2568.24s)]
*  Trump's bitching about it. And today was like pissed because he's like, they're offering a [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2575.52s)]
*  $400 million expense that we would otherwise have to pay. Air Force One is a mess. We have two planes [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2582.56s)]
*  that are Air Force One. In my first term, I went to Boeing and said, here are billions of dollars [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2589.68s)]
*  for you to fix these planes, which are 40 years old, Trump says. And not only does Trump win again [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2595.7599999999998s)]
*  multiple years later and they're still not done, but again, they are projected to be done no sooner [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2603.6s)]
*  than 2035, which would be 20 years after Trump contracted with Boeing to redo them. Here is a [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2609.04s)]
*  little bit of Trump explaining it today in stop five. And I think this was just a gesture of good [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2620.96s)]
*  faith. And I don't get it. Someday it'll be like Ronald Reagan. They decommission them. You know, [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2626.88s)]
*  they get to a certain age, they decommission them. It'll go to my library. They're talking about going [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2633.2000000000003s)]
*  to my library in years out. But I thought it was a great gesture. And it's something that was done [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2637.92s)]
*  by Ronald Reagan. They actually decommissioned the plane and he put it in his library. And [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2645.28s)]
*  it actually has made the library, I think of Boeing 707, it's actually made the library [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2649.36s)]
*  more successful. So it was good. Do you plan to use the plane after you leave office? No, I don't [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2655.7599999999998s)]
*  know. It would go directly to the library after I leave office. I wouldn't be using it. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2661.7599999999998s)]
*  Now that's an important addendum that we didn't know yesterday, that he doesn't plan on using it [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2669.04s)]
*  for personal use after he leaves office, which does support the argument that it's a gift to America, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2674.16s)]
*  not to Trump, per Pam Bondi's logic. And I'll just give you one more, Walter. Here's Trump trying to [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2679.68s)]
*  explain how stupid his critics are on this particular issue, Sat 5B. I could say, no, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2684.56s)]
*  no, no, don't give us, I want to pay you a billion or 400 million or whatever it is. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2692.16s)]
*  Or I could say, thank you very much. You know, there was an old golfer named Sam Snead, did you [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2697.84s)]
*  ever hear him? He won 82 tournaments. He was a great golfer. And he had a motto, when they give [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2703.6s)]
*  you a putt, you say thank you very much. You pick up your ball and you walk to the next hole. A lot [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2708.48s)]
*  of people are stupid. They say, no, no, I insist on putting it. Then they put it and they miss it. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2713.92s)]
*  And their partner gets angry at them. You know what? Remember that Sam Snead, [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2719.92s)]
*  when they give you a putt, you pick it up and you walk to the next hole and you say, thank you very [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2724.7200000000003s)]
*  much. So what do you make of it? Because I should say, sorry, one other thing. I should say a lot [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2728.96s)]
*  of conservative blowback against the president, even from non-Trump Trump derangement syndrome [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2735.92s)]
*  people saying, this is not good. We should not be taking gifts from the Qataris who are not the [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2740.24s)]
*  best people. Do they not yet know how Trump works? Have they not yet cracked his algorithm? [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2745.04s)]
*  Every week, every few days, in case we run out of outrages, Trump does something that I call throw [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2753.12s)]
*  the media a chew toy. This is a chew toy. It allows them to sit by the fire and bite, lick, [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2759.8399999999997s)]
*  slobber at some non-issue, which causes total distraction while he does something like end a [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2769.12s)]
*  war. Now we'll be talking about this Qatari plane all week, I can tell you. And by the end of the [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2777.04s)]
*  week, we'll find out that the Ukraine-Russia war ended or something while we were on our, [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2783.2s)]
*  you know, slobbering over our chew toy. But, you know, so in a way, it doesn't matter the specifics [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2788.16s)]
*  because they're always outrageous. To be a chew toy, it has to sort of be borderline bad taste and [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2795.2s)]
*  is it legal and is it constitutional? And in some ways it has to be gauche too, because it's Donald [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2800.8799999999997s)]
*  Trump, right? I mean, the plane has to be over the top. People will be looking at, oh my lord, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2806.96s)]
*  you know, solid gold toilet paper holders. Yeah. First of all, he's going to guarantee more [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2812.7999999999997s)]
*  attendance at his library if he gets that thing parked in back than any other president in history. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2820.96s)]
*  He may also not have to build a whole wing on it. People will just, it's a 747, people will just [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2827.12s)]
*  use that as, that could be the library. It could be the library. But it gets us talking about issues [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2832.0s)]
*  that in a weird way, in the same way, remember how he did an AI or somebody did of him dressed as the [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2838.64s)]
*  pope a week before we got an American pope? And it got us talking about the pope and thinking about [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2845.6s)]
*  it in all sorts of ways. And just because that was the chew toy that week was that AI of the pope. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2851.68s)]
*  And then it gets us ready for the main course. Now, gutter, whose name I can never pronounce. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2857.44s)]
*  I know, no one can. You know, it's going to be in the news and part of a lot of negotiations [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2863.6s)]
*  probably coming up. It's for better or for worse, a power player in the Middle East and in the United [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2870.08s)]
*  States. And suddenly we know who it is. We know what gutter is. Most Americans without this plane [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2876.08s)]
*  wouldn't, they still can't place it on a map and they still can't pronounce it. Look at me. But at [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2882.88s)]
*  least they're aware it exists. Yeah. And they're aware it exists suddenly. How interesting is that, [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2889.12s)]
*  Megan? I'll make a prediction. Two weeks from now, for reasons other than the plane, [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2894.56s)]
*  gutter will be in the news, but Americans will already recognize that they're talking about a [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2900.72s)]
*  country when they hear that. Well, we'll see whether anybody actually tries to sue, to stop it. I don't [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2905.6s)]
*  know. My main concern would be, can we please make sure that there are absolutely no listening [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2914.32s)]
*  devices or other things left on board that plane? Because this is our president, our national [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2920.8s)]
*  security officials in the air. We definitely don't trust gutter. I mean, definitely do not. We cannot. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2926.0s)]
*  And Megan, that's what I first thought too. What he's really doing is he's trolling Boeing. You [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2933.2000000000003s)]
*  can't finish your damn planes. And he just trolled Boeing in the past. You can't get your astronauts [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2939.6000000000004s)]
*  down off your space stations. Why do we have to keep bailing you out? This is really aimed at [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2945.92s)]
*  Boeing. There should be a massive class action lawsuit against Boeing by the United States people, [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2952.16s)]
*  by the American people, for all the money we've given them to get what? Nothing, according to [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2958.8s)]
*  Trump, and nothing for another 10 years on top of it. This is actually an epic fail. You get tasked [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2963.84s)]
*  by the federal government to refurbish two existing planes and you still can't do it. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2971.2s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely disgusting. They're apparently way over budget and way behind the [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2975.6s)]
*  deadline. What a shock. Okay. So that's Qatar, gutter, whatever. You guys got it. There is a [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2979.8399999999997s)]
*  lot going on though. I mean, we kind of sort of stopped the budding war between India and Pakistan. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=2986.8799999999997s)]

*  an investor, he's made a lot of money about the fat drug. And Jason retweeted it saying, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3248.0s)]
*  Mr. President, this was a private conversation. Next time, check with me first. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3253.52s)]

*  the ones that are intended. But so true. Like when he said it didn't work, and he took sort of shots [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3272.88s)]
*  at it. And he said his friends neurotic, he painted a picture that's just indelible. And I don't think [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3280.6400000000003s)]
*  America now has a better comedian, salesman, troll, and politician than Donald Trump. He's [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3289.12s)]
*  taken all four hats. Yeah. So by the way, then Debbie Murphy, my producer told me Jason Calacanis [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3297.7599999999998s)]
*  used to be heavy, and apparently first became famous ish for becoming a weight loss blogger. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3306.0s)]
*  They said that in 2007, he was credited with starting an internet trend after he called [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3315.52s)]
*  fat blogging, that he called fat blogging after being fed up with being overweight via the LA Times [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3321.44s)]
*  in 2007. They said about 10,000 people visit his website each day to read his business ideas, [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3326.88s)]
*  musing on tech, and potshots at rival entrepreneurs. Then he pulled an Oprah on his audience [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3331.76s)]
*  and became the guru to a budding movement of fat bloggers. He decided he was fed up. He used to be [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3336.5600000000004s)]
*  a spelt 165 pounds and then ballooned to 207 after working night and day at his desk. And as he lost [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3342.0s)]
*  the money, the weight, he blogged about it. So it's a funny joke. It wasn't actually him [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3351.76s)]
*  because he's slim now, but very funny. Okay. Moving on, the China deal. I do think this is [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3358.32s)]
*  interesting. I don't know whether this is a win or a loss. I haven't understood the tariffs from [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3364.88s)]
*  the moment Trump started them, but I just want to tell the audience, this is what he's announcing [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3370.24s)]
*  today. He has said that the reciprocal tariff, this is Scott Besson who announced it, the [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3375.7599999999998s)]
*  reciprocal tariff on China where we jacked ours up to 125 and then they jack theirs up on us to 125 [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3380.72s)]
*  for all goods is now going to 10%. Beijing is going to cut its retaliatory levies on US goods [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3389.04s)]
*  to 10% too. So we're both going from 125 to 10%. A separate 20% tariff that Trump imposed for [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3396.16s)]
*  China's role in the fentanyl problem will remain. We're not removing that. And that's good because [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3403.8399999999997s)]
*  fentanyl is a scourge on our nation. US said the reductions will last for 90 days while the talks [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3412.16s)]
*  continue. Wall Street Journal pointing out, of course, this tariff rate is still much higher [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3417.3599999999997s)]
*  than when Trump took office where it was 11%. And now if you do 10% plus the 20, it's at 30. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3422.4s)]
*  But they're saying overall, if you factor in all those sort of increases for this, that or the [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3428.8s)]
*  other, it's about 39% right now, according to the Citibank team. So it's higher. We're definitely [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3434.0s)]
*  charging more for Chinese goods to come into this country. But Besson says the consensus as the US [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3440.0s)]
*  met with China over the weekend was that we will reach a fuller trade agreement that, quote, [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3447.84s)]
*  neither side wants a decoupling. Stocks are surging all over the board now. In response to [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3451.76s)]
*  this, the market's thrilled. And I'll just read you what Charlie Gasparino said, because I trust [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3457.92s)]
*  him. He does not hate Trump at all and has been defending him on most things. He's the business [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3462.88s)]
*  reporter, senior business reporter at Fox. Every major trader slash investor I spoke to today [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3468.2400000000002s)]
*  said markets are ripping not because Trump crafted some great new art of the deal with China on trade. [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3473.6800000000003s)]
*  Rather, we're back to square one with the country and kicking the terra for can down the road. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3479.28s)]
*  That averts stagflation in the short term and maybe longer if we get a deal after 90 days. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3484.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes, markets love trade capitulation. And he went on to say that Trump was really forced to do this. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3489.2000000000003s)]
*  I mean, he went on to say it's like it had to happen. The markets were just too bad. The bond [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3496.32s)]
*  market in particular, there was no way for him to keep this rolling. And that Trump promised a lot, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3501.28s)]
*  but the truth is the bond market in particular responded so negatively to this war with China [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3508.96s)]
*  that we had to wave the white flag and China had to wave for the white flag. And there's a lot of [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3515.12s)]
*  white flag waving that Trump's going to take credit for. But I think the idea is he created the problem [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3519.2s)]
*  and now he's solving the problem. But does he get credit for solving the problem he created? [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3526.16s)]
*  Others are saying, no, something had to be done about this and getting the world's attention on [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3532.56s)]
*  this trade imbalance and what China's been doing is a win in and of itself. I don't know. Any thoughts [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3537.84s)]
*  on tariffs? Well, if I don't have any thoughts on tariffs, that means I'm the only person in America [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3542.6400000000003s)]
*  who doesn't because we had more experts grow up overnight on tariffs than almost any other issue [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3551.04s)]
*  in my lifetime. So you were humble enough to say, I don't understand what this has all been about [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3556.8s)]
*  since the beginning. I sort of understand it. My job is to educate myself on these things. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3564.4s)]
*  And I'll say this. Have you ever negotiated anything? Of course you have, Megan. You've [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3570.2400000000002s)]
*  negotiated salaries, you've negotiated contracts, book contracts. Even I have done that. And at the [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3575.28s)]
*  beginning of negotiations, a lot of things are said that cause people to go, oh no, it's going [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3581.76s)]
*  to break down. This is going to destroy everything. I won't get a book published at all. Oh, I won't [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3587.84s)]
*  get in the movie if I play too tough. But negotiations are the beginning of a game [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3593.12s)]
*  and a rough game when it involves China and the US and trillions of dollars. That we're doing it at [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3599.44s)]
*  all is a plus. That we're examining this at all, that we're at the table, that we're playing this [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3605.8399999999997s)]
*  rather rough contest, I think is good. Number two, both Trump and China have one thing in common. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3612.24s)]
*  They like to save face. It's thought to be a perennial feature of certain Asian cultures, [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3621.2s)]
*  that saving face is almost more important than actually winning things. And in Trump's case, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3628.64s)]
*  being able to brag and thump his chest and be Donald Trump is also very important. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3636.3199999999997s)]
*  So you've got two very proud and very vain partners in this negotiation who are finding [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3641.3599999999997s)]
*  a way for each other to save face, but they both have real objectives. On Trump's part, [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3647.52s)]
*  he wants to bring back manufacturing to some extent. He wants to reduce this trade deficit. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3653.68s)]
*  And he wants to kind of bring back especially very vital industries, chip making, various defense [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3659.36s)]
*  technologies and so on. I think we're closer to getting those things than we were before. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3668.56s)]
*  And you said both sides are waving the white flag. Well, that's logically impossible. You can't have [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3674.6400000000003s)]
*  double surrender. Well, can I just say this? Another tweet from Charles said, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3682.1600000000003s)]
*  breaking, economists still trying to figure out what concessions on trade China agreed to. He [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3687.2000000000003s)]
*  said, I know this sounds sarcastic, but it's true. Megan, it was only years after the Cuban [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3693.1200000000003s)]
*  Missile Crisis that we found out that Kennedy made a deal with the Russians to withdraw [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3699.76s)]
*  missiles from Turkey. The Cuban Missile Crisis for many years was portrayed as a total American [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3706.4s)]
*  win. We backed down the Soviet Union and they took their missiles out of Cuba. We later found out [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3712.6400000000003s)]
*  that we made a huge concession in order to get that. So the thought that we can look behind the [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3718.6400000000003s)]
*  curtain and know who's won what and who's getting what and where it's leading at this early date [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3724.0s)]
*  is folly. But I think it's important for both sides that the things that they do concede, [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3730.4s)]
*  they're not embarrassed by. No, that's clear. He goes on to say this. I think that this is another [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3736.6400000000003s)]
*  good one from Charlie, and it makes some sense to me. This is from this morning. [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3744.48s)]
*  Breaking, in talking to sources who run small businesses, the pause with China came just as [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3750.0s)]
*  their companies, I think he's talking about American companies, were on the precipice of [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3754.8s)]
*  disaster since they sourced so much of their material from China and the containers coming [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3759.36s)]
*  from China were coming back empty. If you want to know why we were as desperate for a deal as the [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3764.4s)]
*  Chinese, it's because small businesses, a key MAGA constituency, was about to get crushed. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3769.76s)]
*  So I guess time will tell whether this was a good idea or a bad idea, but a reset [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3776.08s)]
*  seemed in order because the trade disparities were pretty severe between us and many other [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3785.6s)]
*  countries. And I know we're not supposed to care. It's not supposed to be a thing. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3790.4s)]
*  But the other thing is if Trump really wanted to use tariffs to raise money, [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3793.68s)]
*  which was one of the debates, is he just doing this to raise money? Or does he actually want [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3797.28s)]
*  to fix trade disparities? I'd like to see the receipts on it, right? Have we? Trump keeps [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3800.8s)]
*  saying that we've earned all sorts of money. We've made all sorts of money on these. I'd love to see [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3807.28s)]
*  the accounting on it. I've seen some of it, whether it's accurate or not. And it's pretty modest, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3811.52s)]
*  given the voracious needs of the US Treasury and spending. It's not something that's going to [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3818.32s)]
*  replace the income tax, certainly tomorrow. But at the same time, the principle of raising money [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3827.12s)]
*  off of people who want to trade with us and just as in the pharmaceutical drug issue, [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3835.8399999999997s)]
*  creating a little bit more of a level playing field after years of what Trump contends is [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3842.88s)]
*  being taken advantage of. You can be content with marginal gains if you're moving in the [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3848.3199999999997s)]
*  right directions. And also, this negotiation isn't over. It'll probably be going on in some fashion [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3853.04s)]
*  for the first half of his administration. Okay. So let's keep going. There was this big skirmish [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3860.56s)]
*  over the weekend in Newark at an ICE facility where federal officials arrested Roz Bakara, [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3869.2s)]
*  the Democratic mayor of Newark and a candidate for governor of New Jersey. After a confrontation [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3877.36s)]
*  that also involved three members of Congress at a new immigration detention facility in Newark. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3881.92s)]
*  They went there. They say we were just innocently there. We just wanted to take a look at the [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3888.08s)]
*  facility. That's part of our oversight responsibilities. And it resulted in ICE [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3892.16s)]
*  officials trying to stop them. A confrontation ensued. You can see them getting aggressive. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3899.12s)]
*  And I mean, what looks like an assault? I don't know. It looks like pretty aggressive behavior [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3904.48s)]
*  by the lawmakers. They say it was aggressive behavior by the ICE officers. In any event, [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3910.72s)]
*  now the Democratic mayor of Newark has been arrested and Democrats are freaking out, including [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3916.48s)]
*  AOC who came out and spoke to this today. I think we have the AOC, Saad Dewey. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3923.3599999999997s)]
*  DHS is allegedly looking into arresting members of Congress who were showing up for their legal [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3929.52s)]
*  and constitutional obligation to conduct oversight. If anyone's breaking the law in [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3938.96s)]
*  this situation, it's not members of Congress. It's the Department of Homeland Security. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3944.4s)]
*  It's people like Tom Homan and Secretary Kristi Noem. You lay a finger on someone, [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3949.76s)]
*  on Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, on representative or any of the representatives [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3956.32s)]
*  that were there. You lay a finger on them. We are going to have a problem. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3962.56s)]
*  Okay. Then we do because they were forced to lay a finger on them because they behaved [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3966.08s)]
*  like brutes. Let me show you. This is released by DHS representative LaMonica McIver. You can [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3974.0s)]
*  almost see AOC almost list her name and then stop herself because the video of this woman does not [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3980.16s)]
*  reflect some sweet, peaceful little congressional overseer there just to take a look at things and [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3987.12s)]
*  not cause problems. Here she is in this video making physical contact with ICE officers in [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3992.96s)]
*  a scrum after the mayor's arrest on Friday, Saturday. She's in red. Look at her shoving, [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=3997.76s)]
*  shoving forward through an ICE agent. She's bothering that ICE agent, not the other way around. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4010.4s)]
*  Look, she's shoving. She's actually like almost punching. Look at that. Shoved another police [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4023.68s)]
*  officer. That's assault. She too should be in jail. So much for AOC's warnings and protestations [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4028.88s)]
*  about who the real offender is here, Walter. Don't wear red if you plan to be an aggressive [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4035.52s)]
*  rioter. I mean, I could follow every move. Everybody else was in dull green and uniforms [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4042.88s)]
*  and so on. And here's this big Scarlet Cardinal throwing her weight around. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4051.28s)]
*  And I mean, we've been talking about weight loss drugs, but she had a lot of heft to throw around. [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4058.6400000000003s)]
*  And that matters in fighting. That matters. They arrange fighting by weight class. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4064.5600000000004s)]
*  I did running. [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4071.44s)]
*  Yeah. She was in the upper classes of the weight class thing there. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4073.28s)]
*  Okay. So, you know, since January 6th, we've been told that any form of unruly behavior on the part [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4077.92s)]
*  of people who, you know, are protesting government policy is terrible. Interaction tantamount to [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4087.12s)]
*  overthrowing the Constitution. But of course, this isn't. They want a special category for this. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4096.8s)]
*  They're just doing oversight. It looks like Black Thursday, Megan. Everything in American politics [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4105.36s)]
*  is starting to look like Black Thursday, you know, as people try to get that cheap Walmart TV [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4111.04s)]
*  before the rest of the people. That our civic life and Congress people are adding to this has [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4116.639999999999s)]
*  degenerated into some kind of Donnybrook that you'd see outside, you know, a Best Buy on Black Friday [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4124.48s)]
*  is really sad. And I hate to be, I don't mean to be conspiratorial, but they were there knowing [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4132.400000000001s)]
*  this was going to happen. They were there to get in people's faces. And she wore red for it the same [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4139.200000000001s)]
*  way you wear red to an awards dinner. So you'll stick out. And AOCs, you lay a finger, all this [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4145.92s)]
*  kind of Jenny from the block, you know, I'm just Bronx girl telling you, you know, what's going on. [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4155.2s)]
*  I hate to put it this way, but this kind of, you know, streetification of our politics where [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4163.44s)]
*  everybody's acting like, you know, they're a Crip or a Blood or a, you know, Latin King, whatever. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4168.96s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4174.24s)]
*  Yeah, Jasmine Crockett. It's not an orchestrated plan, but it seems to be something, it seems to [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4175.04s)]
*  be a temptation that they're all giving into. You know, maybe this kind of works on TV. Maybe [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4184.48s)]
*  American voters are at the point where we can just turn this into, you know, wrestling, not, [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4191.12s)]
*  not like wrestling, but wrestling. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4197.36s)]
*  Actual. Yeah. Your comment about don't wear red to the protest if you don't want to, you know, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4200.32s)]
*  be seen reminded me of one of my favorite moments on Twitter ever where it was one of those [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4205.44s)]
*  situations where two people committed a crime and then one called the other and got them on tape [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4211.52s)]
*  admitting the crime. And the piece of advice was, you know, pro pro tip when you have committed a [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4216.56s)]
*  crime with another person and that person calls you up after the fact and tries to go over every [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4223.52s)]
*  detail of the crime you committed together, the only proper response is no, that is not a thing. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4229.76s)]
*  That's, that's it. There's, you know, exactly what's happening. That is not a thing. Do not wear the [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4237.360000000001s)]
*  cardinal red to the protest unless you wish to be caught on camera. And here's more of [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4245.360000000001s)]
*  representative LaMonica McIver, Democrat of New Jersey, verbally berating the ICE agents on the scene. [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4250.400000000001s)]
*  She's touching the ICE agent. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4266.64s)]
*  He assaulted me. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4284.0s)]
*  So there she plays the victim. You have the nerve to put your hands on me. After the video we just [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4296.64s)]
*  saw where she was actually physically touching and pushing and assaulting, it's right there on the [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4307.6s)]
*  videotape, multiple ICE agents and law enforcement agents. There's more video of it. We'll show you [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4312.72s)]
*  here. This is video one. This is released by DHS appearing to show her making physical contact [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4317.52s)]
*  with more ICE officers in the scrum. There's a lot of this. This woman's going to be in a lot of [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4323.68s)]
*  trouble. She's physically, obviously this is assault. This is legal assault. And yet to read [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4329.92s)]
*  the mainstream media coverage of this, of course, would have you think it's just the mean evil ICE [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4336.4800000000005s)]
*  agents who assaulted these poor, sweet members of Congress who were just going there to look over [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4343.4400000000005s)]
*  what was obviously an inappropriate and disgusting ICE facility because we don't care about migrants. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4349.6s)]
*  Ultimately, they were allowed in and their tour resulted in them saying, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4356.8s)]
*  oh, it was actually really clean and nice in there. Even these loons had to admit it. So I think we're [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4362.56s)]
*  going to get a lot more of these. Do you not? Oh, obviously it got attention. This is the Democrat [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4369.280000000001s)]
*  version of Trump's chew toy. They're going to have to stage a Donnybrook, a free for all, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4376.56s)]
*  hit each other with chairs on the stadium floor every couple of weeks because they use it to [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4382.0s)]
*  illustrate social problems. They think that they get the best of this because they send an [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4388.400000000001s)]
*  anti-authoritarian message. But from what I just saw there, the ICE agents, the last thing they want [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4394.72s)]
*  to be doing is getting body checked by big ladies in red dresses. They are not acting aggressively. [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4401.12s)]
*  Their job is not to go after Congress people. It's to act as police and guards in this facility. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4408.8s)]
*  Unless you're going to question the right of the facility to exist, then why come bashing in there? [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4417.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, America has institutions which are policed, prisons, detention facilities, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4423.52s)]
*  all kinds of things. You come running in there and trying to start something. I don't think the first [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4434.72s)]
*  thing that the ICE agent wants to do is come out of that the bully. They seem to be backing up all [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4445.4400000000005s)]
*  over the place. When you look at the crowd shots, they're in the minority. They're outnumbered. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4451.68s)]
*  The spokesperson for ICE comes out, for DHS, I should say, comes out and says that there will [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4457.92s)]
*  be more arrests, which I would expect. I think that woman we've been looking at, Ms. LaMonica [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4469.200000000001s)]
*  McIver, is probably going to get the cuff slapped on her soon. The Democrats are going to treat it [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4475.76s)]
*  like they treated the arrest of that one judge in the Midwest who escorted the illegal right out of [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4480.88s)]
*  her courtroom after she threw ICE out. Democrat behaves badly, even unlawfully, and then faces [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4488.16s)]
*  the natural consequences of that behavior. Then they cry, victim. Oh, boo hoo, poor me, [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4497.12s)]
*  the mean, mean ICE agents, the mean, mean Republicans, the mean, mean Trump administration. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4504.400000000001s)]
*  I think the public's kind of used to this. They're getting used to this behavior. I don't know how [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4509.04s)]
*  many dividends this is going to pay. Oh, I think it pays no dividend at all. One of the talking [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4513.76s)]
*  points for the Democrats has been that Trump ushers in chaos. In order to affirm that with [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4520.8s)]
*  the people, they have to keep stirring chaos. Expect this to keep going on. That's right. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4528.56s)]
*  That's a good point. But going back to the Luigi killing, what we've seen since Trump was elected [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4534.72s)]
*  was an inability to prevail at the ballot box, followed by this kind of renaissance in direct [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4541.92s)]
*  action at the street level, civil disobedience, all the way to David Brooks writing in the New [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4549.280000000001s)]
*  York Times, it's time to have an uprising, or JB Pritzker the other day saying it's time for civil [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4554.64s)]
*  disobedience. They've been calling for this directly and we're seeing it now. So for them to [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4560.72s)]
*  suddenly proclaim themselves innocent, passive victims after their leaders have been saying, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4567.04s)]
*  get out there, do what you can, get in their face is ridiculous. Yeah, it's a bit rich. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4571.4400000000005s)]
*  And speaking of people who continue to play the victim, even though they're not, here is today's [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4579.68s)]
*  daily dose of Michelle Obama, who has been out there trying to promote her terrible podcast that [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4586.24s)]
*  has absolutely no fan following. And she decided everything she says and does is a complaint, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4592.88s)]
*  everything. And so she winds up talking to Tina Knowles, also better known as Beyonce's mother, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4599.5199999999995s)]
*  about marriage and divorce, which is Michelle's favorite topic, one of them at least. Number one [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4608.32s)]
*  is how much she hates her time as first lady. She hated it. And number two, I mean, you could go [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4615.68s)]
*  either way, how racist the country is and how much she can't stand it. And then we're coming in, [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4620.56s)]
*  at least in the top three, is her negative comments about her husband and her marriage. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4626.0s)]
*  Here she is talking with Tina Knowles about number three, sort of. I love the way [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4631.12s)]
*  you talk about the need to get your independence because your marriage wasn't always what [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4637.84s)]
*  it should have been. Okay. So she's going right in like independence is what it's about. Of course, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4648.4800000000005s)]
*  you know, you had a shitty marriage. I can totally relate. And then can I just show you one more? [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4657.84s)]
*  Um, look at sought 23. No, no, no, no, I'm sorry. It's the VO VO six, where the two of them get up [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4661.68s)]
*  and they start dancing. And this is part of the Michelle Obama attempted reinvention. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4669.84s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I'm not impressed to make herself into something cool. Here she is again, make [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4676.56s)]
*  herself into something cool. Walter that like we can relate to. She's a cool girl because she was [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4681.68s)]
*  first lady and that she can get up there and dance with Beyonce's mom. I'm sorry, but all I [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4687.52s)]
*  can think is you hate the country. You hate your husband and a couple of lame steps to the left, [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4693.52s)]
*  steps to the right, ain't going to cure it. The whole dancing thing, of course, crested during [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4700.64s)]
*  COVID with all those propaganda nurse orchestrated dances that were meant and teachers and teachers [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4706.64s)]
*  and so on. We really have gotten the body, the human body into American politics and the way the [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4715.28s)]
*  rest of the world must be just looking at, I mean, is there any other country in the world where they [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4720.8s)]
*  do this much dancing? Um, the reason they do all this dancing is because they don't have any [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4726.0s)]
*  arguments. They can't speak, they can't converse, they can't argue. So the person who are we going [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4732.48s)]
*  to have a dance off for the U S president next time? I mean, it, it looks like it might come at [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4738.639999999999s)]
*  least in the next 20 years. I don't think she's going to win. I think Trump will win that one too. [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4743.44s)]
*  But, but okay. So the other night I was on, I was on the Greg Gutfeld show and we were doing a bit [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4748.16s)]
*  about how the press is complaining that Melania isn't spending enough time in the white house. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4754.24s)]
*  She's only been there for 14 days during this whole term so far. But what happens with every [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4760.719999999999s)]
*  first lady after they get out of there is they tell you how much they hate it's living in the [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4766.879999999999s)]
*  white house. What a trap it is, what a prison it is, how, how absolutely suffocating the role of [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4771.6s)]
*  first lady is, you know, here's Melania just saying, I got other things to do in other houses to live [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4778.320000000001s)]
*  in and they're criticizing her. But, you know, on the other hand, we have Michelle telling us about [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4783.280000000001s)]
*  this long incarceration and her marriage and her role and her white house and so on while she dances [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4788.64s)]
*  finally free of the dude of the house of the place. And no wonder she has no audience because [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4796.24s)]
*  nobody likes to tune into a podcast to hear somebody's sad stories about themselves. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4805.92s)]
*  Yes. Yes. All her whining. Here she is again, this, this woman, Tina Knowles. Okay. I don't [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4813.12s)]
*  know what she's done in her own right. I'm sure she's accomplished some things, but being Beyonce's [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4820.32s)]
*  mother is interesting. So of course a good interviewer would make it all about that, frankly, [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4824.8s)]
*  but Michelle typical makes it all about one other thing. Michelle here is an example. How does it [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4830.08s)]
*  feel to share your story with the world? Because let me tell you, when I wrote becoming, I shared [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4837.28s)]
*  this, not about me, but what I'm saying is that, you know, I was all confident writing the book. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4843.4400000000005s)]
*  And then the day it was coming out, I could not sleep because I thought, oh my God, I told [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4850.24s)]
*  everybody everything. Everything. Okay. And by the way, like she dials up her like accent, you know, [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4856.64s)]
*  her street accent. I told everybody everything. She doesn't talk like that. She didn't use to talk [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4865.68s)]
*  like that. And, and they call it code switching and they've given it, you know, this big rationale [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4871.4400000000005s)]
*  that you have to, you know, when you're a member of a certain community, be able to talk to the [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4878.64s)]
*  street and be able to talk to the, you know, ambassador and go back and forth. All of that [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4883.200000000001s)]
*  tells me you have no self. What we used to call that was chameleonism. And it meant that you are [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4890.0s)]
*  completely driven by impressing whoever you're trying to sell something to such that you'll [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4896.240000000001s)]
*  completely change your personality. The idea that she is an AOC does this and a lot of politicians [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4901.52s)]
*  do this. Oddly Trump doesn't. Trump always talks like Donald Trump, no matter how inappropriate is. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4910.0s)]
*  Trump could be out in the woods talking to loggers and he's still Donald Trump. And frankly, [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4918.160000000001s)]
*  I, and I think that's one of his great advantages in this era of code switching and chameleonism. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4924.160000000001s)]
*  And, you know, targeted personalities. And the problem with Michelle Obama is that she has no [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4930.56s)]
*  natural constituency. You know, where's Barack? He made her famous and now she's turning on him. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4938.0s)]
*  She's obviously on some really long runway to divorce or a breakup. Maybe, maybe their fortune [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4945.84s)]
*  is such that they can't get divorced in the way you and I can by just walking out the door and [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4952.4800000000005s)]
*  saying, hey buddy. But they don't, you know, she doesn't have to soften us up forever. If she wants [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4957.36s)]
*  to go spread her wings, just do it. You know? Well, every comment, I mean, truly this audience [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4963.12s)]
*  knows that we've been watching them about marriage, about Barack, about relationships is comes from a [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4969.2s)]
*  dark place. You can tell this woman is about a lot of issues. She's bitter, bitter about being his [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4974.799999999999s)]
*  wife, about the career, I guess she never had. By the way, she was only first lady for eight years. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4980.719999999999s)]
*  You can go have a legal career. I could resume my legal practice tomorrow. I'd have to fire up, [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4986.4s)]
*  back up my bar licenses. I'd be fine. You have to take some continuing legal education to get there. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4991.44s)]
*  You can do it. Stop bitching and moaning about it. Fucking do it. Stop. Instead, she wants to be [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=4995.759999999999s)]
*  loved in the podcast lane. She's failing and she's getting progressively more bitter. Here she is, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5001.44s)]
*  listen here, talking about, oh, now it's everyone's problem. It's not just her problem in her [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5007.5199999999995s)]
*  relationship. It's what we do to girls. You see, we're sending the wrong messages to girls. Watch. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5012.0s)]
*  23. I'm trying my best because I know that when it comes to raising daughters and women, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5017.52s)]
*  you know, we're socialized to think that we aren't good enough. We're socialized to think that we [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5024.56s)]
*  need somebody else to make us whole. And that starts so young. I mean, it starts with Barbie [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5030.96s)]
*  dolls and kin and the wedding dress and the questions that we ask our daughters. Trying to [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5037.68s)]
*  figure out how to not program that in my girls and the girls in my life. Because, you know, [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5043.76s)]

*  asking them, are you happy? But are you dating somebody? And then they're dating somebody. And [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5056.0s)]
*  then it's like, oh, you're dating somebody when you get married. And then it's on and on and on. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5061.280000000001s)]
*  So when you're going to have a baby. And that's not for everyone. It's not for everyone. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5066.64s)]
*  It's definitely not for Michelle Obama. It's basically an F the patriarchy segment saying, [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5072.400000000001s)]

*  and what a good time it is. And now she's got all this time on her hands. Listen, Michelle, [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5122.0s)]
*  if you don't believe in women attaching themselves to powerful men, then why did you attach yourself [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5127.12s)]

*  clueless. And again, she's not nearly as self aware as I thought she was. She's one of those people who [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5157.44s)]
*  was much better off when she was behind the veil, when she stood, she's benefiting from this over [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5163.76s)]

*  becoming as the image of Michelle Obama that was a fortune was spent on cultivating. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5187.280000000001s)]

*  masks on, she's not a very persuasive or compelling person. No, it's like she can read a speech. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5223.76s)]
*  That's what she can do. She can read a speech. Well, that's written for her by someone else. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5230.72s)]
*  And that's really seems like the alpha and omega of Michelle Obama's public talents. All right, [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5235.4400000000005s)]

*  her that she's bad in bed, that this woman had been told by one of Holly Berry's ex-boyfriends [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5390.16s)]

*  out of 10, you just ignore them. Holly Berry felt the need to respond to that by saying at the time, [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5404.24s)]
*  oh, just ask my man if you don't think I'm good. I was like, what? Who would do that? And then provide [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5413.280000000001s)]

*  then, I'm telling you, I've watched it happen. She's gotten more and more inappropriate in her [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5426.08s)]

*  Well, let's hope it's her badge. And number two, let's hope it's her. [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5541.76s)]
*  Oh, no, we lost Walter in a critical moment. What happened? Holly Berry boomed into the [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5554.16s)]

*  to know what number two is on Holly Berry. Let's hope it's her badge was number one. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5588.72s)]
*  We don't know what number two is, but we're going to find out. We're looking forward to that. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5594.8s)]
*  Okay, before we go back, I want to point to, let's see, there's a bunch of things here. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5599.04s)]
*  Dylan Mulvaney has partnered with Versace to be, I guess, a new spokesmodel. Take a look at [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5606.0s)]
*  Dylan in his Instagram post from last week, Saat29. [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5613.52s)]
*  I think this is the best I've ever looked. Pretty sure, I'm pretty sure, headed to a Versace event. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5618.08s)]
*  And yeah, I think this is it, right? Okay, okay. Love you. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5624.8s)]
*  There he is again, cosplaying being a woman with an enormous fake boob. He's obviously had breast [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5638.0s)]
*  implants, which is new, I think. And he's wearing a Versace dress because he's celebrating the fact [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5643.84s)]
*  that he has been, I guess, hired by Versace to endorse Versace's clothing. And he's wearing last [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5650.16s)]
*  season's dress. I just want you to know that. It's a dress that was brought to me back in the fall [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5658.24s)]
*  for me to possibly wear to the Al Smith dinner, but I rejected it. And it's a dress that [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5663.4400000000005s)]
*  Melania Trump wore on New Year's Eve as only Melania Trump could and actually did look [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5670.8s)]
*  spectacular in it. Here she is. I mean, we should really do a who wore it best kind of side by side [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5677.4400000000005s)]
*  with Melania Trump, as one of my followers on Twitter put it, not just a woman, but the woman [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5683.04s)]
*  versus Dylan Mulvaney. And what another colossal blunder for Versace, whose brand [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5692.32s)]
*  is already hemorrhaging. They've already kind of gone down. They're already kind of known as more [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5699.04s)]
*  of like a, it's not one of the top couture brands anymore. It used to be, but because of asinine [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5703.84s)]
*  moves like this, they've suffered. And I'll be really surprised if I ever see Melania Trump [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5709.36s)]
*  wear Versace again. You had literally one of the most beautiful women in the world wear your dress, [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5714.0s)]
*  and you decided to counter that by putting a man who poses as a woman and gets off on diminishing [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5719.5199999999995s)]
*  women by acting like a four year old as he claims he is one, wear the same dress. It's a fail. [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5725.76s)]
*  Still working on Walter. Then I wanted to get to this from Chelsea Handler, who seems like an [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5732.64s)]
*  absolutely disgusting person talking very casually about her many abortions. Take a listen to her on [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5740.08s)]
*  the Burnouts podcast from me, from me. Got pregnant a couple of times when I was a teenager and got [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5749.04s)]
*  abortions. Thank God I, my parents had the sense to make sure that that happened. And thank God, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5755.36s)]
*  as I got older and more mature, I understood that that's not what I'm cut out for. That's not my [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5761.04s)]
*  lifestyle. And I'm good at a lot of different things, but that's just not one of them. And that's okay. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5765.599999999999s)]
*  Thank God. My parents encouraged me to have my multiple abortions while I was in high school. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5773.36s)]
*  Where were those parents encouraging you not to have pre-marital sex or sex as a teenager or [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5778.32s)]
*  unprotected sex or irresponsible sex and understand that you were making a very serious [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5783.92s)]
*  choice in doing so? Where were your parents then? You might be, instead of thanking God for those [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5789.4400000000005s)]
*  parents, on your hands and knees praying to God to try to help you see the way because you've [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5794.4800000000005s)]
*  clearly been raised by people who are errant in their parental responsibilities. I don't care [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5799.2s)]
*  whether you're pro-choice or you're not. Every sane parent says to their child, please don't do this. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5804.56s)]
*  And if you are going to do this and you're going to go your own way for the love of God, [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5810.0s)]
*  please use protection. Use multiple forms of protection. Here are the weaknesses of the [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5814.0s)]
*  protection that are available. So you know exactly what you're getting into. And please, [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5818.16s)]
*  God forbid, if anything happens, you bring it to me and we can help find our way through it. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5822.24s)]
*  I'm disgusted by her and I'm disgusted by her parents. Back to Walter. Thank God. What is number [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5827.6s)]
*  two that Holly Berry that we need to know about the Holly Berry segment? Well, yeah, I'm sorry [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5832.56s)]
*  for the interruption. I get one-on-one time with Megyn Kelly in front of the country and then the [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5839.6s)]
*  damn internet goes out. Terrible luck. Holly Berry, she looks terrible. She's trying to prove she's [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5845.76s)]
*  sexy and not a robot. That means she is. That means she's very anxious about her appeal. I stood in [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5853.4400000000005s)]
*  line with her once at a seafood joint in Malibu. She was a beautiful, flawless woman, just absolutely [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5859.76s)]
*  radiant. She looked terrible there. The guy who participated in that should be ashamed of himself. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5867.6s)]
*  I mean, what an exploitative thing to do. It reminded me of like Star 80, one of those movies [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5874.56s)]
*  about a model who goes downhill because of a boyfriend who wants to get famous. What an awful [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5880.240000000001s)]
*  way to get his mug shown around the world. That was sad. I'm sorry she's so anxious about her sex, [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5887.200000000001s)]
*  one of the most beautiful women in the world. If she's not good in bed, that doesn't matter. [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5898.32s)]
*  A woman doesn't have to be good in bed. She just has to be beautiful, lie there and available with [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5902.799999999999s)]
*  nice lighting and say you're good in bed. The secret of a woman being good in bed is to tell [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5909.36s)]
*  the guy he is. No guy has ever complained that some beautiful woman just radiated her sex appeal [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5916.32s)]
*  and what she's supposed to do. Climb around, swing from the ceiling. That's his job. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5926.72s)]
*  That is so true. That's like Andrew Schultz, who's so funny, crass, but in a great way. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5934.64s)]
*  Who's like all you women, they're so worried about this noise or this fat whatever. We don't care. [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5940.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't care. We don't care about any of it. Just as long as you're willing, we're cool. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5947.4400000000005s)]
*  Right. Just say, I've never seen a man like you before and you're the best in bed we've ever had. [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5953.6s)]
*  Then suddenly he's feeling the same about you. You don't have to humiliate yourself [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5961.68s)]
*  and diminish your brand. As Walter points out correctly, you're sending exactly the [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5965.92s)]
*  opposite message of the one you intend to convey about like, see how sexy I am, I'm in bed. No one [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5971.04s)]
*  would actually do that. No one actually has to do that who actually believes that they have sex [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5975.84s)]
*  appeal. Bring the lover in the bed and have him keep commenting about how he can't wait to get on [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5980.72s)]
*  me. It's so classless and gross and yes, she looks terrible. Walter, thank God I came back. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5986.64s)]
*  Why do they need lube? Why do they need lube? In other words, unless there's something really [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=5992.72s)]
*  unnatural going on, they shouldn't need lube. Oh, she's getting older now, Walter. It happens. [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=6000.4800000000005s)]
*  Isn't that the exact message that she doesn't want to send? I mean, she was telling us that [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=6007.6s)]
*  she's a sex goddess a minute ago and now she's telling us she needs lube. I want to know what [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=6013.68s)]
*  flavor it was. That's all I want. Oh, good God. I got to go. It was a big pleasure. Not that big, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=6018.4800000000005s)]
*  but it was a pleasure, Walter Kern. See you soon. Kelly's court tomorrow. [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=molvK1q3_b4&t=6024.72s)]
