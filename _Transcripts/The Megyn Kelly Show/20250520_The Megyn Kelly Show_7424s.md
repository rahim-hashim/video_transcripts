Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, co-authors of "Original Sin," to discuss their new book, the revelations about Biden's cognitive decline and the cover-up by those around him, the way they each covered the story at the time, Tapper's viral interview with Lara Trump from 2020, whether the media was part of the cover-up, what Tapper was thinking behind-the-scenes at the June Biden debate meltdown, the criticism of the book and reaction to it from the left and right, and more. Then Batya Ungar-Sargon, The Free Press columnist, joins to discuss how top Dems and the entire establishment was involved in the outrageous Biden cover-up, why most of the corporate media was involved as well, and more.

# Truth About Biden Cover-Up, and "Original Sin" Revelations, with Jake Tapper, Alex Thompson, More
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 20, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Today, a deep dive into the decline [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=0.0s)]
*  of President Biden's cognitive health while in office, including never before heard stories from [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6.08s)]
*  those very close to the president and a true reckoning about the media's role in the Democrat [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=12.48s)]
*  party's attempted coverup. In minutes, I will be joined by CNN's Jake Tapper and Axios' Alex Thompson [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=18.16s)]
*  regarding their new book. It's called Original Sin, President Biden's Decline, its Coverup, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=24.72s)]
*  and his Disastrous Choice to Run Again. This will be their first long form interview. The book does [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=31.68s)]
*  include some shocking new details, including from some of Mr. Biden's own cabinet secretaries, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=38.239999999999995s)]
*  who said that by 2024, the president could no longer be relied upon for being able to perform [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=44.16s)]
*  at 2 a.m. if there were some sort of emergency. He was not able to answer that call. Another [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=51.04s)]
*  revelation from the book, a source close to Mr. Biden said, quote, five people were running the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=58.16s)]
*  country and Joe Biden was at best a senior member of the board. Who were those five people running [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=63.6s)]
*  the country and who exactly perpetrated this attempted coverup? We will ask for and receive [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=71.2s)]
*  names in just a moment. But first, a look back at the president's decline that we reported on [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=79.44s)]
*  at the time that was called nothing more than a conspiracy theory. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=86.08s)]
*  We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women created by the goal, you know, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=92.24s)]
*  that you know the thing. Signs of a slipping Joe Biden were everywhere, even in the run up to the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=97.68s)]
*  2020 election for a politician long known for gaffes. This was something different concerning [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=102.96s)]
*  brain freezes like this one on CNN in April 2020. You know, there's a during World War Two, [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=109.36s)]
*  you know, where Roosevelt came up with a thing that, you know, was totally different than a [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=117.03999999999999s)]
*  than the score. He called it the, you know, the World War Two. He had the World War Production [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=124.0s)]
*  Board. But raising questions about Mr. Biden's mental fitness back then was risky. Just ask [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=130.24s)]
*  Laura Trump, who dared to go there in an interview with Jake Tapper weeks before the 2020 election. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=135.68s)]
*  I think what we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=142.24s)]
*  That's what I'm referring to. It makes me uncomfortable. You have no. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  That's so amazing. It's so amazing to me that. And try and figure out an answer. A cognitive decline. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=153.04000000000002s)]
*  You're trying to tell me that what I was suggesting was. I think that you were mocking [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=158.16s)]
*  his stutter. Yeah, I think you were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=162.16s)]
*  to diagnose somebody's cognitive decline. Less than four and a half years later, it's Tapper [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=166.48s)]
*  doing the examining. Starting in around 2019, 2020, there were two Bidens. There was a Biden [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=171.6s)]
*  that was perfectly workable, serviceable, seemed fine. And then there was a non-functioning one. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=176.56s)]
*  In his new book, Original Sin, co-authored with Axios's Alex Thompson, the pair document the [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=181.76s)]
*  behind the scenes panic among Democratic officials over Joe Biden's decline. Tapper claims he was on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=188.79999999999998s)]
*  the case all along, but couldn't report fully until after the election, when more people were [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  finally willing to talk. But it was a story most Americans had already seen with their own eyes. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  The best way to get something done, if you, if it holds near and dear to you, that you [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=207.84s)]
*  like to be able to. Anyway. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=214.16s)]
*  Forgetting the names of world leaders. I want to thank that fellow down under. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=219.76s)]
*  Thank you very much, pal. And then the moment that shocked even casual observers. Jackie, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=224.56s)]
*  are you here? Where's Jackie? Asking for Congresswoman Jackie Walorsky, who had died [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=230.8s)]
*  in a car crash seven weeks earlier. The president had publicly mourned her death when it happened, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=236.16s)]
*  even lowering White House flags in her honor, but he remembered none of it. Tapper did occasionally [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=242.24s)]
*  press White House officials. Watch him, right? Watch him. And he, I've, I've. They are watching [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=248.72s)]
*  him. That's what I'm saying. That's 77% who are concerned. It is hard for us to keep up with this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=254.96s)]
*  president. The same president who couldn't remember the name of Hamas. There's been a response [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=260.64s)]
*  from the opposition. Then came the bombshell, Her special counsel report. Mr. Her described [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=267.36s)]
*  president Biden as an elderly man with a poor memory who could not remember when he was vice [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=274.64s)]
*  president or the year his son, Bo died. I think anybody sitting down for an interview like that [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=280.48s)]
*  where you're being asked specific dates over and over again, you're not going to remember every [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=285.6s)]
*  single one. In early June, 2024, a Wall Street Journal story exposed concerns from members of [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=288.96s)]
*  Congress about a diminishing president. There's been a relentless focus in some news outlets [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=294.79999999999995s)]
*  on minor slips by our president that I frankly think are typical of anyone who's keeping a [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=300.96s)]
*  demanding 14 hour day schedule. A coordinated message claimed conservative media was deceptively [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=306.47999999999996s)]
*  editing clips in major areas where people get their news. This lie or this concept about Joe [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=313.35999999999996s)]
*  Biden is being validated. Fake videos of president Biden that are being referred to as cheap fakes. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=319.67999999999995s)]
*  They're cheap. They're just distorted out of context videos chopped up in certain ways, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=325.91999999999996s)]
*  constructed in certain ways. He's far beyond cogent. In fact, I think he's better than he's ever been. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=330.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=336.72s)]
*  Joining me now, Jake Tapper. He's the host of The Lead with Jake Tapper on CNN and Alex Thompson. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=342.0s)]
*  Alex is a national political correspondent for Axios. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=347.76000000000005s)]

*  These days, it feels like nothing surprises us anymore, but not in a good way. The headlines [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=358.24s)]
*  are heavy. The future feels uncertain and so much is out of our control. But one thing you can take [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=362.72s)]
*  control of right now is your family's financial future with life insurance through select quote. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=368.24s)]
*  Whether you need 500,000 or 50 million in coverage, select quote makes it easy to find the right [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=373.84000000000003s)]

*  in coverage since 1985. And they do it fast, often in as little as 15 minutes. Other life [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=384.56s)]
*  insurance brokers might push generic overpriced plans, but select quotes licensed agents work [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=391.59999999999997s)]
*  for you, not for the insurance companies. Even if you have a preexisting condition like high blood [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  pressure or diabetes, select quote partners with carriers who can still offer coverage. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=402.88s)]
*  And if you're healthy, you could get same day coverage with no medical exam required. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=407.52s)]
*  So don't wait for another what if. Consider taking a step to secure your peace of mind. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=411.76s)]

*  Thanks for having us. Yeah, great to have you. Um, all right. First of all, Jake, explain why [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=429.68s)]
*  it's called original sin. It's called original sin because right after the election, we started [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=434.64s)]
*  talking to democratic sources who were telling us how horrible things were not just in front of [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=441.6s)]
*  the cameras and all those clips you showed, but how much worse it was actually behind the scenes. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=446.96000000000004s)]
*  And one of them said to me that the original sin was that Biden should not have run a reelection [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=452.24s)]
*  to begin with, which then necessitated the cover up of how bad things were actually were. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=458.48s)]
*  And that's and that term original sin just stuck with me. Um, some, when Alex and I talked about [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=465.91999999999996s)]
*  doing the book, uh, I think the day before election day, um, I already thought original sin would be [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=472.23999999999995s)]
*  the perfect title because it just gets at how momentous a decision this way was, how momentous [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=478.4s)]
*  a mistake this was to run for reelection. And then of course, the cover up. Alex, we understand that [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=484.55999999999995s)]
*  you originally had drafted a book along these lines, but then the deal fell apart. So how did [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=490.32s)]
*  it get revived? When did publishers get interested in what you were trying to tell? [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=496.56s)]
*  Well, my book project actually was different. I mean, it was a Biden book, but it was with Simon [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=502.15999999999997s)]
*  and Schuster. Um, and they signed the deal in January of 2021 and it was supposed to come out [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=506.15999999999997s)]
*  before the election. And you know, maybe there was, there was maybe going to be some age stuff, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=511.2s)]
*  but it was much more about the family dynamics and how they affected the president and the [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=515.2s)]
*  presidency. Um, ultimately the book deal, uh, did fall apart. Simon Schuster canceled the book in [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=520.6400000000001s)]
*  October of 2023. Um, there are a few reasons, uh, for that. Uh, one was I was running behind, uh, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=527.12s)]
*  two, uh, Biden books were not selling well. And third, you know, there was a, uh, honestly, like a, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=534.6400000000001s)]
*  difference of what sort of book we were, we wanted. And that was most manifest and sort of a, uh, [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=541.4399999999999s)]
*  debate, uh, or, you know, clash over the title of the book. And I wanted to call the book haunted [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=548.64s)]
*  because the thesis of the book was he's haunted by his son, Bo. He's haunted by the Hunter stuff, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=554.9599999999999s)]
*  by the Obama comparisons, by, um, the idea of Trump could win again. Um, and they wanted to call [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=559.28s)]
*  the book, uh, soul man or, um, shadow boxer. And, um, I, so I said no, and, uh, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=564.88s)]
*  good hill to die on. Yeah. So it was an expensive, it was an expensive hill to die on. So I returned [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=573.76s)]
*  them. I returned the advance and then, um, you know, I obviously had some Biden reporting and [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=581.76s)]
*  it was interested in trying to revive some sort of project on Biden cause I'd covered him for so long. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=587.04s)]
*  Um, and it was really, the book was Jake's idea, uh, about making it focused on this one issue of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=592.8s)]
*  the Biden presidency. Yeah. Um, this is the issue. Okay. I got it. Let me keep going. Um, let's just, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=599.76s)]
*  let's, let's go right to the controversy around the book and then we'll get to the contents of [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=605.04s)]
*  the book, which I definitely want to spend time on. As you know, um, this book, it's right in the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=609.12s)]
*  subtitle. It involves coverage of the so-called coverup, but Jake, the criticism has been that [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=614.72s)]
*  you're complaining about a coverup about Joe Biden's mental acuity that failed that right-wing [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=621.6s)]
*  pundits saw the right wing in general saw that independent media saw and reported on. And that [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=627.84s)]
*  was no mystery even to left wing and so-called mainstream reporters who were not fooled, but [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=634.5600000000001s)]
*  chose willful blindness instead of honest reporting and that you were part of it. How do you respond? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=640.72s)]
*  Uh, it's a, it's a tough and fair question. Uh, I would say that Alex and I, after election day, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=647.44s)]
*  um, interviewed more than 200 people, 200, uh, mostly democratic insiders. And all these [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=658.8000000000001s)]
*  interviews were almost all of these interviews were after the election and they justified to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=664.0s)]
*  themselves what they had done in terms of misrepresenting how the president was, not just, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=671.12s)]
*  to me and Alex and other reporters, but also just to each other and to the world and to [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=677.9200000000001s)]
*  Democrats and to the cabinet, et cetera, by, by saying that there was this existential threat [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  of Donald Trump and only Joe Biden could beat Donald Trump. And that justified everything in [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=687.12s)]
*  their minds after that existential threat was over because the election was over in Donald Trump one, [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=690.72s)]
*  they were, we found Alex and myself, um, remarkably willing to talk to us, uh, either off the record [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=696.4000000000001s)]
*  or on background, or in some cases on the record about what they saw. One of the things that emerged [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=703.36s)]
*  was that, uh, there were two Bidens. One was the fine Biden, uh, serviceable, adequate, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=709.36s)]
*  and the other one was a, as a non-functioning Biden. And that's the one we saw the night of the [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=717.2s)]
*  debate. Uh, and that's the one we saw some clips of here and there, uh, that you just showed. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=721.12s)]
*  And that non-functioning Biden, the one that lost his train of thought in a significant way, [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=725.92s)]
*  not in the way just that every human loses their train of thought, but in a way that shows that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=730.96s)]
*  he's having trouble articulating his very views. Um, and the one who forgot the name of close aides [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=735.04s)]
*  who was not able to come up with George Clooney's name, didn't seem to recognize him, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=743.36s)]
*  all that sort of thing. That non-functioning Biden was, according to our reporting, showed up as, as [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=747.92s)]
*  far back as 2015, uh, after the death of Bo, where one top aide said that that tragedy, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=755.2800000000001s)]
*  the loss of Bo, um, was like, uh, watching somebody pour water on sand. That was the effect on his [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=761.84s)]
*  psyche. And there were other moments, uh, 2017, 2018, you hear some, the Her report, one of the [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=767.44s)]
*  reasons he came to that conclusion was because of the recordings they heard of Joe Biden in 2017, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=773.12s)]
*  talking to his ghostwriter, in which he was similarly inclined. Uh, obviously in 2019, [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=777.9200000000001s)]
*  2020, there were other moments like that. Most of his campaign staff and others would say like, [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=783.44s)]
*  he's 78, he's 79, he has senior moments, but he's fine. He's fine. He's fine. Well, he wasn't fine. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=787.6s)]
*  And in, uh, throughout his presidency, um, that non-functioning Biden would show up more and more [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=794.1600000000001s)]
*  and more and he was worse and worse and worse, really, uh, deteriorating tremendously. Uh, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=802.32s)]
*  the next time there was a really horrible family incident, which was when Hunter Biden's plea deal [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=809.28s)]
*  fell apart in the summer of 2023. And then obviously in June he was convicted. Um, and the [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=814.72s)]
*  thought, the fear of losing his son, not to jail, but maybe to another, to a relapse, to an overdose, [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=820.64s)]
*  to suicide, who knows, was a very real fear. And, uh, the, the, the threat of losing a third child, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=826.8s)]
*  um, really just diminished him tremendously according to top aides. So all of which is to say [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=833.84s)]
*  that this was a deterioration. This was a, this was a progression. And look, knowing what I know now, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=840.48s)]
*  obviously I feel tremendous humility about my coverage, uh, that Laura Trump interview, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=848.48s)]
*  for example, et cetera, she saw some, she saw something that I did not see at the time, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=854.96s)]
*  a hundred percent. And I own that. I did ask Joe Biden, uh, to be transparent about his health records [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=862.16s)]
*  in an interview in 2020. I did ask him about the fact that voters thought that he, he was not [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=869.1999999999999s)]
*  transparent at all. No, he promised you that he would be transparent about his health records. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=875.5999999999999s)]
*  And then he wasn't. And when you sat with him again, including one month, including one month [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=879.1999999999999s)]
*  after the Jackie Wolorski thing, you didn't ask him about it. You didn't follow up on the fact that [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=883.4399999999999s)]
*  he was falling up the stairs, that he was losing his train of thought regularly, that he was [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=888.32s)]
*  slurring, that he was incomprehensible, that he was getting lost on the white house lawn. You sat [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=893.5200000000001s)]
*  right across from him and you asked none of that, notwithstanding the fact that he had promised you [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=897.36s)]
*  he would be fully transparent about his health issues. That's true. But I did ask him about his [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=901.44s)]
*  age and the fact that the American people had concluded that even though he said, whenever [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=908.24s)]
*  anybody brought up the subject of his age, watch me. And I said, yes, they're watching you and they [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=912.6400000000001s)]
*  are concerned that you were too old for this job. So you know, you, you know, as well as I do that [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=918.24s)]
*  there's a way of, you can say, Hey, there's this poll on your age, or you could say, you just forgot [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=923.52s)]
*  that Jackie Wolorski was dead. You, you asked where she was moments after watching a videotape [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=929.36s)]
*  tribute to her. You lowered the flags at the white house after she died. This happened 13 [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=936.96s)]
*  days before you sat with him. There is a way of pressing a man like that on the actual infirmities [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=943.76s)]
*  to bring it home to him and to the audience. And you didn't do it. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=949.76s)]
*  That's correct. I didn't. And like I said, I feel humility about my coverage. I mean, it's not like [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=953.92s)]
*  I was asking him his favorite movie or his favorite color. We were talking about Putin. We were [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=958.08s)]
*  talking about other issues of national importance, but yeah, I mean, of course I've said, I look back [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=963.2s)]
*  at my coverage with humility and, and I wish I did cover the issues of age and acuity, but I wish [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=969.36s)]
*  I had covered them much more. And I wish, I mean, of course in it's May, 2025, do I wish that in that [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=977.36s)]
*  10 15 minute interview I had with Biden in October, 2022, that this had been the only subject [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=989.28s)]
*  because I had then. It wasn't just that though, Jake. It wasn't just that. I mean, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=994.8s)]
*  you sat with him a couple of times in the course of his presidency and these issues were not pressed. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=999.3599999999999s)]
*  Well, there was at least that time. And then there was the time at the beginning and, [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1004.0799999999999s)]
*  but separate apart from that, you covered the Biden's presidency. No, no, no. Let me just [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1007.92s)]
*  finish my point. You covered the Biden presidency. I had one interview with him during his first [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1012.56s)]
*  I had one interview with him during his first. And it was 13 days after the Jackie [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1016.16s)]
*  Wollorski thing, but you covered the Biden presidency aggressively throughout the four [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1018.64s)]
*  years and, and you didn't cover mental acuity hardly at all. I mean, time and time again, [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1022.64s)]
*  when issues came up, you seem to be running cover for the president. I don't think that's true. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1028.24s)]
*  Well, I mean, we'll start with the Laura Trump issue that you referred. Here it is. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1033.92s)]
*  This happened in 2020. Joe Biden, as we all know, his work to overcome a stutter. How do you think [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1037.6s)]
*  it makes little kids with stutters feel when they see you make a comment like that? [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1043.28s)]
*  Uh, first and foremost, I had no idea that Joe Biden ever suffered from a stutter. I think what [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1047.9199999999998s)]
*  we see on stage with Joe Biden, Jake, is very clearly a cognitive decline. That's what I'm [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1055.28s)]
*  referring to. It makes me uncomfortable. You are no, this is so amazing. You're trying to tell me [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1061.1999999999998s)]
*  that what I was suggesting was a stuttering. I have no idea, Joe Biden. Yeah. I think you [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1067.36s)]
*  were mocking his stutter and I think you have absolutely no standing to diagnose somebody's [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1072.24s)]
*  cognitive decline. And it's very concerning to a lot of people that this could be the leader [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1076.0s)]
*  of the free world. That is all I'm saying. I genuinely feel sorry for Joe Biden. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1080.96s)]
*  I appreciate it. I'm sure it was from a place of concern. We all, we all believe that Laura Trump. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1085.28s)]
*  Thank you so much. Do you want to apologize to Laura Trump now? [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1088.88s)]
*  I've already apologized to her. I called her months ago. And what does she say? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1095.76s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to disclose the contents of a private conversation, but I thought the [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1101.68s)]
*  conversation went well. And she said, she has said this publicly, so I'm, I'm feel fine sharing [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1105.68s)]
*  it. She said that she would never mock anybody's stutter. But I mean, I, you know, after we did the [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1111.3600000000001s)]
*  research for this book and I realized how bad his acuity issues were, I, like, I mean, I, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1116.16s)]
*  I called Laura Trump and I said, you were, you were right. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1126.4s)]
*  She was totally right. That's the thing, because when I watch that clip and I'm, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1130.96s)]
*  I'm giving voice to what a lot of people watching the show are feeling, Jake, I feel angry because [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1134.4s)]
*  she was right. And not only did you not allow her to make her comments, but you, you seem to try to [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1139.68s)]
*  humiliate her. You, you had a hostility toward the position, but she was totally right. And then you [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1146.0s)]
*  lectured her on how she was in no position to diagnose cognitive decline, which you guys do at [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1152.5600000000002s)]
*  length, including on page four of your book, you describe at length his cognitive decline, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1159.2s)]
*  which is all she tried to do with you. But you had such a visceral reaction to her. And my feeling [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1164.8s)]
*  is that's because you didn't want to hear it. No, I mean, we can, I'm happy to talk about this. I [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1170.0800000000002s)]
*  didn't come here thinking that you weren't going to ask me about this. I'm happy to talk to you [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1176.4s)]
*  about it. The first time I saw the coverage of Laura Trump's comments, which were interpreted [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1179.52s)]
*  as her mocking Joe Biden stutter was in January, 2020. I read it in conservative media. I read it [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1186.4s)]
*  in the Daily Mail. And that's where I saw that her comments were being interpreted that way. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1193.76s)]
*  After those comments were publicized, it got a lot of coverage. And Sully Sullenberger wrote an [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1201.2s)]
*  op-ed in the New York Times criticizing her about this. So that's the context for that, [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1208.56s)]
*  that I was following up on a story that had been out there months before. This is also in the [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1217.84s)]
*  context of October, 2020, a very intense time. People on the Biden side are saying crazy things [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1224.56s)]
*  about Trump. People on the Trump side are saying crazy things about Biden, including Don Jr. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1230.8s)]
*  suggesting that Joe Biden is a pedophile. So that is the larger context. But as I said, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1235.28s)]
*  her comments have aged well. My comments have aged poorly. I own that. But I think what is [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1241.76s)]
*  significant is, in addition to me owning that, the reporting that Alex and I have done, which is [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1249.76s)]
*  beyond just, and then when I say just, I don't mean to diminish it, but the comments of Joe Biden [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1257.36s)]
*  making gaffes, saying things stupid, tripping, are all important and all deserved to be aired [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1264.48s)]
*  and all deserve scrutiny. But as you know, Megan, because even though you look 30 years younger than [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1272.48s)]
*  me, we're roughly the same age, Joe Biden has been saying stupid things for decades. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1277.36s)]
*  Okay. I get what you're saying, but this minimizes it too, because it was more than saying stupid [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1281.84s)]
*  things. But I'm telling you, over here in my ecosphere, we were covering all of these. It [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1287.6s)]
*  wasn't just falling down. It was getting lost. It was some of the stuff you report in your book. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1293.28s)]
*  We knew, and we were reporting on the multi-jump cuts in the videos of him, or it was obvious he [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1298.16s)]
*  couldn't get through a one-minute take. So they had to use those. It was clear to us that he was [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  using teleprompter. And there was some reporting on that at the time, all of which the White House [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1309.84s)]
*  was denying. Now, with the current White House, I have some connections. With the Joe Biden White [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1314.56s)]
*  House, I had none, but you did. You did. And so while... Even in Washington, 30 years, Jake, [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1319.84s)]
*  you and CNN have White House connections, but there was no effort, none to get to the bottom [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1327.6s)]
*  of this. And now for you guys to write this book, there was a cover-up. It's like there was a [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1332.8799999999999s)]
*  cover-up and there was an attempted cover-up. It could only ever work if you allowed it, [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1337.84s)]
*  if the press allowed it. Some of us tried not to, and some of us were complicit. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1343.28s)]
*  First of all, the Biden White House did not like me. Okay? I do not have great connections [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1349.84s)]
*  with the Biden White House. Well, clearly, you have a lot of sources. You say you talked to over [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1357.6s)]
*  200 sources for this book. This is after the election. Do you have someone who could have [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1360.8s)]
*  called and worked? No. That's the point, is that they were not being honest. That's the point. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1363.6s)]
*  Well, how did the Wall Street Journal get it in June of 2024? And Jake Tapper and CNN couldn't [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1369.52s)]
*  find sources for this story then, before he dropped out? Annie Linsky and Siobhan Hughes [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1374.0s)]
*  did an amazing job in their reporting. And they should be heralded. And I heralded them. I had [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1380.48s)]
*  them on my show right after the debate to talk about their great reporting. But Annie Linsky... [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1386.56s)]
*  After the debate. But you did not put them on when they published that story, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1390.8s)]
*  which was before the debate. Correct. I don't know what the booking situation was, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1394.32s)]
*  but it wasn't because I didn't want them. I'm sure I said that day, let's book... [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1400.4s)]
*  Instead... Yeah, you put on a Democrat, and you allowed the Democrat to rip on the report as a [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1404.24s)]
*  Murdoch-sponsored hit piece. No, no, no. Megan. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1412.0s)]
*  It's just... That's what happened. Go ahead. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1415.28s)]
*  Megan, if we're going to do this, let's just stick to the facts here, okay? [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1417.76s)]
*  When there is a damaging report... Jake, that's what I've been doing all along. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1422.96s)]
*  I'm talking about what you just said. One of us didn't miss the biggest story of the [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1427.04s)]
*  century when it comes to presidential politics, and one of us did. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1430.64s)]
*  Okay. So there is a difference between the clips of Joe Biden falling on a stage [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1435.2800000000002s)]
*  at the Air Force Academy graduation. There is a difference between the clip of Joe Biden [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1448.16s)]
*  embarrassingly forgetting that a Republican member of Congress, who he's talking about, [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1452.72s)]
*  has died. Those are embarrassing, those are important, but there is a difference between [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1457.68s)]
*  that and the investigative journalism that Alex and I were able to do and only able to do [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1463.44s)]
*  after the election. And I know you know this because you've been talking about the scoops [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1469.8400000000001s)]
*  in the book, and you've been talking about... I don't diminish the importance of the book. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1473.2s)]
*  I have supported the importance of the book, and we'll talk about the contents of the book at length, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1477.68s)]
*  but there is no way we can have that conversation with an audience that is as skeptical of your [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1482.48s)]
*  ability to tell the story as mine is without addressing your role in this. Alex is a different [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1488.4s)]
*  story, but you know, you've watched the coverage since it came out that you wrote this book. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1494.4s)]
*  There are this legion of articles about how comparing you in some instances to OJ, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1499.52s)]
*  instead of, if I did it, this is if I hid it, that like you are not the right messenger to bring the [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1507.2s)]
*  story about the cover-up because you helped, you allowed it, and you likely did that out of [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1513.76s)]
*  a desire to help Joe Biden and hurt Donald Trump. You didn't want to do anything that [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1520.5600000000002s)]
*  might improve Trump's chances. I do not think that that is accurate. I do not think that that is true [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1526.5600000000002s)]
*  at all. The idea that Siobhan and Annie do their piece, and we have on the co-chair of the Biden [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1534.0s)]
*  campaign, is not me trying to cover for the Biden campaign. That is me putting the questions of the [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1540.16s)]
*  reporting that were made to him and saying things like, so you really haven't seen any moment, [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1545.84s)]
*  or you would acknowledge that, wouldn't you acknowledge that he's lost a step, he's 81, [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1551.04s)]
*  etc., etc. Like I said before, if I had known then what I know now, would I have been [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1555.04s)]
*  more aggressive? Yes, of course. How did I know, and you didn't know? I'm just curious, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1563.84s)]
*  because when I saw that Wall Street Journal report in June of 24, I scoffed at it, like, okay, [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1568.56s)]
*  it's an attempt, but it's lame. Everybody on the right-wing ecosystem and the independent [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1574.8799999999999s)]
*  media ecosystem knew it was a lame attempt that only scratched the surface. We had all been [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1580.08s)]
*  discussing his serious cognitive problems for years by that point. Jake, in June of 2022, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1584.8s)]
*  this show did a full two-hour program on his cognitive decline. I know we want to pretend, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1592.72s)]
*  I'm mentioning the Wall Street Journal as a courtesy, but those of us on this side of the [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1598.88s)]
*  aisle had been reporting in depth on his multiple problems and the obvious lies we were being told [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1603.2s)]
*  for years, for years. You really want the audience to believe you were fooled? [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1608.16s)]
*  What do you mean I was fooled? I'm not saying I was fooled, I'm saying we all saw these moments [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1615.6000000000001s)]
*  before the camera, and they were obviously concerning, and he was obviously aging, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1620.08s)]
*  and that was significant. So what did you do to get to the bottom of it? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1625.1999999999998s)]
*  I'm trying to answer the question. So the people at the White House, when I would call, [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1628.8s)]
*  when others would call, when Alex would call, would lie. He's fine, he's fine. You'd call [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1633.4399999999998s)]
*  Democrats and say, what are you seeing behind the scenes here because this is concerning? [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1639.12s)]
*  He's fine, he's fine. This is just a moment. He's 79, he's 80, he has moments like that, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1643.76s)]
*  but he's fine. His decision making is fine. They're still saying that. They're still saying [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1648.64s)]
*  that. And let me defend Annie and Siobhan there for a second because you just said that their [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1652.5600000000002s)]
*  Wall Street Journal story just scratched the surface. They got what they could get in June [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1657.5200000000002s)]
*  2024. And I went back, and Alex and I went back, to report some of the same things that they reported [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  on. For example, there was a meeting in the White House about Ukraine funding in January 2024, [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1670.96s)]
*  and we were able to get people to say things as a Democratic member of Congress that, look, [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1677.44s)]
*  I don't know who Annie and Siobhan's sources are, but they were not able to get them to do that. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1683.44s)]
*  I assume that they had dozens of sources for that article, but not one of the Democrats that they [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1688.24s)]
*  talked to would even talk on background. It is a complicated thing to try to get to- [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1694.96s)]
*  But your commentary on your show- [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1700.6399999999999s)]
*  Yes, I'm going to bring you in. But your commentary on your show, Jake, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1703.04s)]
*  consistently ran in one direction. Occasionally, you would ask some tough questions. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1706.1599999999999s)]
*  I hope that's true. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1710.8799999999999s)]
*  Here you are on September 2023 saying that Biden was sharp mentally. September of 2023. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1711.76s)]
*  No, hold on. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1719.04s)]
*  You said he's sharp mentally. I think the question is physically, right? He's sharp mentally. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1719.76s)]
*  And then you pointed out that his opponent, Donald Trump, was only a couple of years younger [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1725.44s)]
*  than he was. There are many examples where you're doing that kind of coverage. [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1728.8s)]
*  Okay. So let's be honest and full about what you're talking about. Frank- [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1732.48s)]
*  There's no problem with honesty on this show. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1738.16s)]
*  Okay. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1742.16s)]
*  Yeah. Let's watch it. Let's watch it. Yeah. Frank Ford came on with a biography about Joe Biden. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1742.48s)]
*  Frank Ford came on to talk about his biography with Joe Biden, and I'm trying to summarize [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1747.8400000000001s)]
*  what his conclusions were. So he is saying that Biden was- [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1753.6000000000001s)]
*  Where is the part where you say he's not sharp mentally, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1758.56s)]
*  Frank? We've seen the following 10 examples in the past year, nevermind three years. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1762.3999999999999s)]
*  Where I wasn't, I've already said, I wish I had covered this more aggressively. Frank [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1770.6399999999999s)]
*  Ford had come to the show to talk about his book about President Biden. This was in September [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1775.76s)]
*  2023. And I interviewed him about his book, and that was the end of that. Now, I suppose, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1782.08s)]
*  in retrospect, I say again, I wish I had been more aggressive. I do. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1791.6s)]
*  But our reporting suggests, and like I said, we've talked to more than 200 people, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1796.24s)]
*  Democratic insiders, that the real deterioration of President Biden, and yes, there was a [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1801.12s)]
*  degression or regression, whatever you want to call it, deterioration, since 2015. But it really [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1807.68s)]
*  started to intensify in the summer of 2023, when Hunter Biden's plea deal fell apart, [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1813.6000000000001s)]
*  and Joe Biden was terrified about what that effect would have on his son. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1821.68s)]
*  I accept that. I accept that it got worse in 2023. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1825.68s)]
*  And people close to him say that was a real demarcation. And in October 2023, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1829.28s)]
*  there is the last cabinet meeting for almost a year. And cabinet secretaries tell us that that [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1836.4s)]
*  began, that fall 2023 began what they call a weird period, where they were kept at bay, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1842.96s)]
*  where they were kept away from President Biden. [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1850.0s)]
*  Okay. And now we're getting into the substance, which I do want to talk about. I'm about to [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1852.24s)]
*  switch to that. But let me just ask you, because when we got to leading up to the debate, which [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1854.64s)]
*  you anchored that June 27th debate, 2024, there was a ton of news leading into that debate. And [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1859.28s)]
*  that month, and we look back at your coverage and found that you ignored it. Not only did you [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1865.12s)]
*  ignore the Jackie Walorski moment when you had him 13 days later, but you ignored the freeze up [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1871.1999999999998s)]
*  that he had at the Juneteenth celebration. You ignored what happened at the G7 when he wandered [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1876.8s)]
*  off in Georgia, Maloney, Prime Minister of Italy had to go find him. You ignored the freeze up [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1881.84s)]
*  at the George Clooney LA fundraiser. You didn't cover it. You only covered it after the debate, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1887.6s)]
*  after George Clooney wrote his op-ed. Jake, nobody made you do that. Your network at every [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1894.56s)]
*  turn was telling us those were quote, cheap fakes. And you were not combating that narrative. CNN was [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1902.8s)]
*  actively misleading us on what our very eyes were showing us. That's the truth. That's the record. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1910.0s)]
*  I will acknowledge that after I was named moderator, co-moderator of the debate, [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1917.52s)]
*  I tried to make sure that my coverage was fairly vanilla, both about Trump and about Biden, [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1927.28s)]
*  because I just wanted to get to the debate. And, you know, the Biden people and the Trump people, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1934.24s)]
*  I'm kind of frankly surprised that either one of them agreed to have me as a moderator, [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1940.1599999999999s)]
*  because both sides disliked me so much. But yeah, I remember that moment. And I remember that moment, [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1947.12s)]
*  the glitch at the immigration event, and not getting much attention outside of conservative [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1954.72s)]
*  media at all. And Alex and I are here to say that conservative media was right, and conservative [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1959.6799999999998s)]
*  media was correct, and that there should be a lot of soul searching, not just among me, [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1965.76s)]
*  but among the legacy media to begin with, all of us, for how this was covered or not covered [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1973.68s)]
*  sufficiently. 100%. So, I mean, I'm not here to defend coverage that I've already acknowledged. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1978.96s)]
*  I wish I could do differently. Let me bring Alex in. Thank you for your patience, Alex, [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1987.84s)]
*  and apologies for the back of the- I think he's fine. I think he's fine. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1992.8s)]
*  The audience may not be aware of this based on what just happened, but Jake and I are actually [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1996.08s)]
*  friends. And this is all said in, look, the context of I know what my audience wants to hear asked. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=1999.76s)]
*  And Jake has told me before, he wanted the opportunity to answer these questions. So, [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2006.0s)]
*  here, that's what we're doing here. Megan, we didn't come on the show [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2010.6399999999999s)]
*  thinking that this was going to be a softball interview. I understand. Like, listen, listen, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2014.24s)]
*  as a- first of all, nobody flagellates Jake Tapper more than Jake Tapper, okay? Like, I get it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2022.16s)]
*  I understand. I am fallible. I make mistakes. It's not just the Biden coverage. I mean, I go back [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2028.48s)]
*  and I look at, like, I wish I had been covering terrorism more before 9-11. I wish that I had [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2034.0s)]
*  covered the WMD with more skepticism. There's, you know, a million things. This is definitely among [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2038.8s)]
*  them. And conservative media absolutely has every right to say we were hip to this and the legacy [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2044.48s)]
*  media was not. Now, I do not accept that I was part of a cover-up. I do not accept that I was [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2051.92s)]
*  just providing cover for Joe Biden. I think a lot of these clips are not fair. The one that is fair [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2059.44s)]
*  is the Laura Trump clip. And I own it. And I regret it. And I've told her that privately. And [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2065.84s)]
*  that's completely fair. But what we uncovered after the election, what people were willing to [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  tell us after the election was so shocking. And yeah, the Jackie Walorski thing is awful. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2079.52s)]
*  But I would posit that President Biden not being able to come up with the name for- of his National [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2086.08s)]
*  Security Advisor in December 2022 is important information. And I would also posit- [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2091.92s)]
*  I'm not arguing that the book has no place or importance. Let me ask Alex something. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2098.72s)]
*  So you may be aware, the hard time I've given you on this show is not because of your coverage of [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2103.12s)]
*  the Biden mental decline. I've given you a hard time over the past couple of weeks because you [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2108.3999999999996s)]
*  were honored by the White House Correspondents' Dinner for covering this story, which honestly is [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2113.8399999999997s)]
*  like getting the award for being the thinnest kid at Fat Camp. I mean, there was literally no [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2119.12s)]
*  competition at the White House Correspondents' Association Dinner that they would even consider. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2124.08s)]
*  They're not going to give awards to anybody in the right wing ecosphere who covered this from the [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2130.24s)]
*  beginning. With all due respect to you, Alex. But when you got up there, you actually got up there [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2133.92s)]
*  and said, we, myself included, missed a lot of this story. And we bear some responsibility for [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2139.84s)]
*  faith in the media being at such lows. But we, the media, did not miss this story, Alex. We did not [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2147.2s)]
*  miss this story. We were all over this story. We were night and day covering this story. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2153.52s)]
*  The we, we knew you hated the we after he said it. We talked about this. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2158.48s)]
*  Well, it was insane. It was an insane comment to make. Who were you talking about? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2162.72s)]
*  He meant the we in the room. He was talking about the people in the room. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2165.92s)]
*  Be quiet. It's not your turn to talk anymore. It's Alex's turn. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2167.7599999999998s)]
*  Who is we? [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2170.8s)]
*  Thank you. I can defend myself. No, we were the people in the room. I mean, like, I was getting, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2171.52s)]
*  it was the White House Correspondents' Dinner. I was talking to the people in the room that covered [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2177.84s)]
*  Joe Biden. All right. So here's my follow up. Got it. Here's the follow up. We, if that's who we is, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2181.36s)]
*  did not miss the story. We, in that room, intentionally chose not to cover the story or [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2187.36s)]
*  dig into the story, which is a massive story that we have missed in Original Sin. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2195.36s)]
*  All right. I'm glad you asked me this question because I heard you rip me to shreds the night [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2204.08s)]
*  out, the Monday after the dinner. And at first I was- [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2208.08s)]
*  What I meant to say was congratulations and. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2211.2799999999997s)]
*  And at first I was defensive, but then I was, you know, I thought about it also, [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2215.68s)]
*  you know, from your all perspective, especially at the missed part and like your readers, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2220.4s)]
*  your readers that were saying, hey, there's a problem here, or not your readers, but your [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2226.24s)]
*  listeners saying there's a problem here and I'm not seeing it reflected in the media. And [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2230.56s)]
*  and after the debate happens, everyone to be like, oh my God, there's a problem. I'd be pissed too, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2235.92s)]
*  because you would feel like you weren't listened to. And that, and I'm sure that a lot of people [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2242.64s)]
*  felt that it was because some reporters let their own personal politics get in the way. And let's [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2247.12s)]
*  be honest, like a lot of newsrooms in DC and New York are more liberal than not. And they, I mean, [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2254.32s)]
*  I'll just say for myself, I think some of them let their own personal politics get in the way. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2262.16s)]
*  But in terms of the missed part, the reason I said missed is because I think there were a lot [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2266.48s)]
*  of really great reporters on this beat. And I know you may disagree, I know your listeners may disagree, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2271.8399999999997s)]
*  but I was in the White House, you know, every day. And I think a lot of them really do try and do [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2277.12s)]
*  some really great work every single day that sometimes you also use on this show from New York [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2284.24s)]
*  Times and others. And I felt that basically saying that calling everyone in the room, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2290.08s)]
*  not a good faith reporter, I didn't think was fair. And so I was, I said missed to sort of give grace [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2297.6s)]
*  for both. Well, that's sweet. I'm less graceful than you are and less forgiving, but that's fine. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2305.2799999999997s)]
*  Takes all kinds. Let's go, let's do some substance, okay, of the book because we still have some time [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2312.56s)]
*  and I want to get into it. You guys write in Original Sin out today. The Biden coverup may [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2316.96s)]
*  not be unique, but it is arguably the most consequential. So what do you mean by that? [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2322.64s)]
*  How so, Alex? Well, we've seen this before. Wilson, you know, and Edith Wilson, his wife, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2327.68s)]
*  after a stroke, FDR was incredibly sick during the 1944 campaign. You know, we obviously know [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2336.88s)]
*  a little bit more now about JFK and Ronald Reagan. I'd say two reasons. One is, you know, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2343.28s)]
*  the FDR one wasn't as consequential because he won. So you mean amongst health coverups. That's [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2350.4s)]
*  what you mean? Yes, that's what I meant. I think that's what we meant in the book. Yeah, sorry. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2357.28s)]
*  All right, let's keep going. You write that you spoke with at least four cabinet secretaries of [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2363.28s)]
*  Joe Biden's and that they said he could not be relied upon to quote perform at 2 a.m. during an [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2368.88s)]
*  emergency. So here's just a little bit more. By the end of 2024. Quoting here from your reporting, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2374.08s)]
*  access dropped off considerably in 2024 and one of the cabinet secretaries, number one, you referred [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2382.0s)]
*  to, said, I did not interact with him as much. I didn't get an explanation. Instead, that cabinet [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2386.7200000000003s)]
*  secretary would brief other senior White House aides who then brief the president. Yes, the [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2392.4s)]
*  president is making the decisions, but if the inner circle is shaping them in such a way, [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2397.2s)]
*  is it really a decision? Are they leading him to something? Said this one [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2401.2799999999997s)]
*  different cabinet secretary, number three, October, 2023, the cabinet was kept at bay [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2405.68s)]
*  with the exceptions of Lloyd Austin and Antony Blinken quote for months. We did not have access [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2411.04s)]
*  to him. There was clearly a deliberate strategy by the White House to have him meet with as few [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2415.7599999999998s)]
*  people as possible or as necessary at one rare meeting during that time. Cabinet Secretary three [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2419.6s)]
*  was shocked by how the president was acting. He seemed disoriented and out of it. His mouth agape. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2424.56s)]
*  All I can think when I see that word agape, Jake, is that debate that you hosted that I just that's [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2431.92s)]
*  what it was the whole time agape to the point where I when I was reading, I listened to my news [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2438.24s)]
*  oftentimes on like these apps that will read you the article and the news readers, the AI news [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2444.0s)]
*  readers pronounced that word agape and all I heard for like, I must have heard 200 times agape [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2449.36s)]
*  the day after that debate. So it was a pattern. The cabinet secretaries were saying it. You saw [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2456.6400000000003s)]
*  it. We all saw it. Um, and yet what did they tell you behind the scenes about what, if anything, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2461.92s)]
*  they did about it? Well, nothing. I mean, that's, that's the thing. Uh, there is very little in [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2467.92s)]
*  terms of actual action that happened. And one of the reasons for that, I think, is because by [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2477.52s)]
*  the end of 2023 and then throughout 2024, so many people had been sequestered off from [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2483.92s)]
*  president Biden, uh, that there weren't people that had any reliable information about his [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2492.24s)]
*  current condition. It's actually one of the interesting parts of the post debate coverage. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2499.2s)]
*  There are people in the white house that the communications effort, uh, communications office [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2506.24s)]
*  of the Biden white house are trying to get them to go out and defend the president, uh, and say, [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2511.68s)]
*  you, you know, I, I just met with him. He's fine. Blah, blah, blah. And they had not seen him in [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2518.24s)]
*  weeks or even months. They could not attest to his fitness. When Ron Klain, the former Biden [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2524.56s)]
*  white house chief of staff is calling around and trying to rally Democrats after the debate [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2531.68s)]
*  to speak about Biden's acuity. Many of them tell Klain, I haven't seen him in a year or I haven't [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2537.3599999999997s)]
*  seen him in a year and a half. Um, now Klain and Klain interprets that as his successor, Jeff [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2545.9199999999996s)]
*  Zients is managing the portfolio poorly and should be doing more to have like, you know, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2552.56s)]
*  um, make nice with Congress stuff. But Alex and I interpret that as they are hiding Biden from as [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2558.08s)]
*  many people as they can. So there aren't as many people who have seen him. I am actually Nancy [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2565.36s)]
*  Pelosi, as we write about in the book has a, has a private and secret meeting with Biden after the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2570.88s)]
*  debate where she's urging him to look at the polling information. And I don't know when the [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2575.7599999999998s)]
*  last time she had had a one-on-one with him was because she suggests that after she stepped down [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2579.6s)]
*  as democratic leader, after the midterms of 2022, she barely saw him. And this is a theme [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2586.32s)]
*  throughout, uh, 2023, especially the last half of 2023 and 2024, how many people didn't have access [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2593.76s)]
*  to him, how many people didn't see him. And that, and this, this was by design you write in the book [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2601.36s)]
*  that Alex, I'll bring you in because there was a so-called, what you write about as a pilot bureau [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2606.48s)]
*  surrounding him. It was four people plus Biden to make five. Can you tell us who those people were? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2612.16s)]
*  And is the theory then that those are the four people who did know and worked as this, [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2617.8399999999997s)]
*  as sort of cabal to keep everybody else at arm's length so that they wouldn't also [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2623.92s)]
*  have full knowledge of his deterioration? [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2628.3999999999996s)]
*  That's me. Yeah. Okay. Um, so the people that we're naming, would they be Mike Donilon, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2634.3199999999997s)]
*  Steve Rashety, Mike Donald's top political advisor, Steve Rashety's top legislative advisor, [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2641.28s)]
*  Ron Klain when he was chief of staff, Bruce Reed, his basically longtime policy advisor. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2646.88s)]
*  You can, those are sort of the four they were known as a pilot borough, gray hairs, poobahs, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2653.84s)]
*  and they were with him the most of anybody. Now, if you were to ask them, and I still think even [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2659.6800000000003s)]
*  if you put them on truth serum today, they would say he was fine. Um, you know, I think, [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2664.4s)]
*  um, I don't know if they're lying or lying to themselves or it doesn't matter. Then there's [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2670.72s)]
*  this other sort of group that aren't the pilot borough, but are just as powerful. And they were [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2676.3999999999996s)]
*  the ones that kept the schedule, uh, affected personnel and really built the bubble. And that [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2680.7999999999997s)]
*  would be any Thomasini who's deputy chief of staff and previously oval office operations. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2686.72s)]
*  And then Anthony Bernal, who was the top aid slash enforcer for first lady, Jill Biden, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2692.16s)]
*  and had incredible influence to the point that even people in the Biden white house would refer [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2698.64s)]
*  to her as one of the most powerful first ladies in history. You write about this guy Bernal a lot, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2704.56s)]
*  and it's, it's, you suggest Jake, it was very tough to find anybody with a nice word to say about this [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2710.24s)]
*  guy who was Jill Biden's top person. Yeah. And he, he acknowledged that he had a tough reputation. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2715.68s)]
*  He was the chief of staff for Jill Biden and perhaps the most powerful first lady chief of [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2721.2799999999997s)]
*  staff in the history of this country. Uh, he is somebody that enforced what Jill Biden wanted. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2726.4s)]
*  And at the end of the day, one of the things that was interesting when, when we wrote this book and [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2732.48s)]
*  researched this book was trying to figure out why was there no discussion of whether or not he should [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2736.7200000000003s)]
*  run for reelection? Why was it just a foregone conclusion that he was going to run for reelection, [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2741.76s)]
*  especially after he had made this kind of vague promise that he would be a one-term president. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2746.0800000000004s)]
*  And it came down to two people, one of whom spoke for Biden, that's Mike Donilon, and the other one [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2751.2000000000003s)]
*  spoke for first lady Jill Biden, and that's Anthony Bernal. And basically they communicated [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2756.16s)]
*  to the rest of the staff. Bernal would say, you run for two terms, you serve for two terms, you [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2761.8399999999997s)]
*  don't do one. And, and Mike Donilon would say, you know, Biden's made the decision, he's running, [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2768.08s)]
*  that's it. There's no discussion. And when people would try to raise it, although nobody directly [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2774.16s)]
*  with Joe Biden, but when people would try to raise, you know, Anita Dunn said something like, are we [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2778.64s)]
*  sure this is a good idea? A different pollster was like, shouldn't we figure out if like this is even [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2783.6s)]
*  a good idea? This is the politics of it all. This is not whether or not he should or should not have [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2788.88s)]
*  been president. This is about whether or not he could get reelected, which is a different level [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2792.64s)]
*  here. They would say the decision's been made, the decision's been made. And so there was a small [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2797.2s)]
*  group of people running the train. And I think that it's not a star chamber so much because they [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2804.24s)]
*  weren't like, it wasn't like five of them in a room making these decisions, but definitely [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2810.08s)]
*  Rashadi and Donilon, definitely Bernal, and then different individuals hopping in and out, [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2815.04s)]
*  whether Jenomali Dillon, who was a deputy chief of staff and then ran the campaign, whether Anita [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2820.16s)]
*  Dunn, whether Ron Klain or Jeff Zients, the chiefs of staff, all played different roles. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2825.2s)]
*  Well, how about, can you follow up, Jake, on what you said earlier? Because just this week, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2830.48s)]
*  Jake Sullivan, the national security advisor, was out saying, geez, what I saw at that debate [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2834.3199999999997s)]
*  shocked me. But you have reporting in this book that Jake Sullivan was well aware that Joe Biden [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2838.08s)]
*  was having some serious memory problems going back years. In December 2022, the day that, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2843.68s)]
*  her name is escaping me, which is ironic. Brittany Greiner. Brittany Greiner, the name, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2853.04s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm not a big WNBA fan. The time that Brittany Greiner gets out of Russian control, [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2856.7999999999997s)]
*  Russian, she was a prisoner in Russia. Biden is outside the Oval Office with, and Jake Sullivan, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2864.64s)]
*  his national security advisor, and Kate Bedingfield, his communications director, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2873.92s)]
*  are there, and he can't come up with their names. This is December 2022. He calls Jake Steve, [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2878.3199999999997s)]
*  and then he calls Kate Bedingfield Press, and then he beckons them to come with him. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2884.96s)]
*  So I don't know, I saw in that same interview that Jake said he did, Jake Sullivan said he didn't [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2890.0s)]
*  remember that. I can't attest to what people remember or what they don't. I just know that [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2895.2000000000003s)]
*  that happened. That happened. And you also report, Alex, that there was interference run by, I think, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2900.16s)]
*  this same Politburo, this cabal, against the White House residence staffers so that they would not [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2905.6s)]
*  witness what the inner circle was witnessing with his deterioration. Can you fill that out a bit? [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2912.8s)]
*  Yeah, the residence staff were really stunned with how, especially the First Lady's office took over [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2920.2400000000002s)]
*  really through Bernal and Annie Tomasini. Both of them, also unusual, had residence staff passes, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2925.6s)]
*  which is not normal for aides in the White House to be able to go to and from. They would just had [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2932.2400000000002s)]
*  certain powers to the point that a lot of the residence staff, they felt they were being kept [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2938.96s)]
*  at bay, that they were not trusted, and that they often were there just twiddling their thumbs. They [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2944.08s)]
*  often went home early. They didn't have a lot to do. And there was a feeling among some in the [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2950.2400000000002s)]
*  residence staff that this was about hiding his deterioration. And we quote one residence staff [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2956.1600000000003s)]
*  official that said, he would just sometimes look at you, and I'm paraphrasing, he would just sometimes [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2963.6000000000004s)]
*  look at you like he doesn't even know you, even though I was seeing him every day. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2967.84s)]
*  They would keep somebody out of the elevator. Is the elevator in the White House normally [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2973.84s)]
*  manned? Because you seem to be reporting that they ejected that person from that post. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2979.12s)]
*  Yes, they basically said, your services will no longer be necessary. And again, it was part of [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2983.8399999999997s)]
*  this larger pattern of where we are taking over the residence now. Your services are needed [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2990.08s)]
*  sometimes, but not as much as they almost always are. How about Jill Biden, Alex? [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=2996.64s)]
*  Alex I mean, she was first and foremost, a protector, and she and loyalty enforcer. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3003.2s)]
*  And she would have tremendous control over the schedule, over keeping that circle very, [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3012.56s)]
*  very close. And I think even though she would never admit that he has any problems, I think by her [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3020.7999999999997s)]
*  very actions, you saw it on the view, but privately too, jumping in with answers, [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3028.24s)]
*  trying to help him along, guiding him, introducing so he remembers who they are. [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3033.7599999999998s)]
*  That by her actions shows that she knows that he needs help, that he needs someone to pick up the [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3038.7999999999997s)]
*  slack. All right, we'll pick it up there. We have to get into the presidential debate and what Jake's [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3043.7599999999998s)]
*  reaction was when he had that onstage meltdown. And what is the reaction from these guys to the [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3048.7999999999997s)]
*  announcement about Joe Biden's cancer diagnosis on the eve of their pub date? Stand by. We'll be [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3055.12s)]
*  right back. Since President Trump's election, the eyes of the nation have been on Mar-a-Lago and the [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3061.44s)]
*  free state of Florida. It is a thriving, booming place. South Florida is a special place because [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3068.56s)]
*  of its amazing water for boating, swimming, fishing, and drinking. Well, today, clean water [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3073.8399999999997s)]
*  is endangered by toxic algae. Did you know that? You may have heard of red tide or blue green [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3078.7999999999997s)]
*  algae. It can be dangerous and it can be gross. In his first term, President Trump signed a law [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3084.88s)]
*  to solve the problem with a new reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee to keep clean, fresh water [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3090.56s)]
*  flowing constantly to South Florida. President Trump said after years of rebuilding other [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3097.04s)]
*  nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Washington can finish the job in next year's [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3101.76s)]
*  budget and keep President Trump's promise. The Everglades Foundation, our advertiser, says that [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3107.28s)]
*  would be very good for Florida and good for the Everglades. Learn more about President Trump's [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3113.52s)]

*  United States, Joe Biden. For the listening audience, he's shuffling out onto the debate [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3127.28s)]
*  stage that would seal his fate when it comes to his candidacy for a second term. Joe Biden [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3135.44s)]
*  at the lectern and Jake Tapper truly had a front row to history in that moment. Welcome back to [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3141.68s)]
*  the show. This is the Megyn Kelly Show and here with me today, Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3147.2s)]
*  They are the co-authors of the new book, Original Sin, President Biden's Decline, its cover-up, [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3150.8s)]
*  and his disastrous choice to run again. All right, Jake. So I have been in the front row of the [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3156.7200000000003s)]
*  presidential debate in big moments. Oh, I remember. I remember. One of the interesting things is [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3163.28s)]
*  always like, what's the dynamic between the anchors on the set when you know big news is being made? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3169.84s)]
*  So walk us through that moment when he completely fell apart with the, I killed Medicare and [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3175.92s)]
*  everybody was left with their own agape moment. Presumably your viewers and listeners know the [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3181.28s)]
*  agape reference by now. So that front row seat was really disturbing. And again, as you say, [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3190.48s)]
*  we all watched President Biden age. We all watched his gaffes. We all watched these moments [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3202.56s)]
*  that were uncomfortable and obviously representative of a decline going on. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3208.96s)]
*  But there was something about that debate that was utterly shocking. And maybe you and your [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3216.8s)]
*  listeners were not shocked. Maybe you thought that this was going to happen and this was all. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3221.92s)]
*  I think it was one of those shocked but not surprised moments for us. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3226.56s)]
*  So he comes out and he's obviously shuffling as had been going on with him for years because of [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3231.84s)]
*  his degenerative spine. And although, by the way, that was another thing that the White House wasn't [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3240.32s)]
*  being honest about. They were saying it had to do with his like breaking his ankle or something in [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3245.2s)]
*  December 2020 and not wearing his boots. And his refusal to wear the foot cast or support. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3249.68s)]
*  Yeah, that's not true. Yeah, not true. So he comes out and he has a cold also and he sounds, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3255.6s)]
*  so even his voice obviously, go back and listen to him. In 2020 his voice is much [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3262.48s)]
*  deeper and stronger. And then he comes out, it's thinner, it's readier. He obviously is [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3267.2s)]
*  coughing a lot. But there was something about that moment. My first text to my producing team [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3272.96s)]
*  read, phlegm. And I saw that same word in your book referencing what you were thinking. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3277.2s)]
*  It was phlegmy. He was definitely very phlegmy. So, but it was a few minutes in. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3283.12s)]
*  I mean, his first answer was not good. But that wasn't ultimately particularly surprising. I think [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3290.2400000000002s)]
*  it was the second answer, the second long answer in that economics block that we did, where [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3296.48s)]
*  he just completely lost his train of thought in such a way that he was like grasping for words. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3302.7999999999997s)]
*  And look, he has those crutches where he starts wandering off and then he says anyway, because [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3309.12s)]
*  he's lost his train of thought. That's something that we've seen. But this was something else. This [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3315.2s)]
*  was something more shocking. And he said, then he says, we finally beat Medicare. And I presumably, [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3319.6s)]
*  he was trying to say we finally beat COVID. But it was really shocking. Also interesting at the [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3326.16s)]
*  time was Trump obviously was very Trumpy during the debate. He did his thing. If you like it, [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3333.68s)]
*  you like it. If you don't, you don't. For Trump, given what was going on to his left, he was [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3339.7599999999998s)]
*  fairly restrained. He wasn't really commenting on the self emulation that was going on. I think he [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3347.8399999999997s)]
*  only made one comment that night about Biden's incoherence. He said something like, I'm not really [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3354.56s)]
*  sure what he just said, and I'm not sure that he does either, something like that. I'm paraphrasing. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3359.92s)]
*  But get to the text that you sent to your control room and the correspondence between you and Dana. [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3364.24s)]
*  So we have iPads, because you can't communicate, obviously, talking to your control room during a [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3370.56s)]
*  debate. We have iPads where you can write on them. And I recommend it if you don't have one, by the [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3377.52s)]
*  way. It's fantastic. And I wrote, because I had no idea who was back there, so I tried to keep it [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3382.24s)]
*  clean. I wrote, holy smokes. Now what I was thinking was holy fuck. I mean, it was just shocking. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3387.68s)]
*  But I kept it clean. Dana writes to me on a piece of paper, he just lost the election. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3394.3199999999997s)]
*  And it was just, I mean, it is, I don't think this is hyperbole at all, the worst debate in the [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3401.3599999999997s)]
*  history of presidential debates going back to 1960. I just can't think of anything even remotely [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3408.64s)]
*  close to it. And then you saw him immediately after you write in the book, and he seemed [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3413.3599999999997s)]
*  like unaware that something extremely problematic had just occurred. Well, it's just, first of all, [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3419.04s)]
*  Jill helps him down from the stage. It's like a one, it's a one step stage. Maybe it was a little [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3427.6s)]
*  distracting because there were weird lights or whatever, but that looked weird, too. But they [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3433.7599999999998s)]
*  come over to the table. Trump is long gone. He's probably in the air at that point. And [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3438.16s)]
*  they come over, and they really didn't seem to have any idea that this had been as bad as it was. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3445.92s)]
*  And it was very awkward. He said something about, sorry about my cold. And he tried to say something [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3453.2s)]
*  about how much Trump lies. And then he said something like, I guess we'll go see what the [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3460.56s)]
*  commentators have to say or something like that. And he and Jill wander off. And it was just [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3465.92s)]
*  one of these, you know, sometimes you think like, did I just see that? Was that did I just witness [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3470.8s)]
*  this 90 minute event? During it also, I'll just say, so I'm 56. So I'm now at the age where like, [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3477.04s)]
*  I love sleep. Like sleep is something that when you're a kid, you hate it so much. But when you're [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3485.44s)]
*  an adult, you're like, I can't get enough of it. And I even thought as this debate started, [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3490.08s)]
*  why are we starting at nine? This is so late. And then when Biden started to fump around, [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3495.84s)]
*  I thought, man, starting this at nine was really a bad idea. Why didn't they ask? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3504.48s)]
*  They never should have agreed. We never should have agreed. Following up on a point from earlier, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3507.6s)]
*  Alex, because we talked about the cabinet secretaries unnamed, and we talked about the [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3512.0s)]
*  Politburo protecting him and you gave us the names. There is a suggestion in the book, though [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3516.32s)]
*  it's never written explicitly that President Biden wasn't always making the calls as president. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3521.6800000000003s)]
*  Is that is that what you're reporting that that he was not in full command of the decision making [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3526.88s)]
*  for those four years? Well, some members of the cabinet told us that they felt that one of them [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3532.32s)]
*  put it to us this way is because what happened is they closed ranks. They had the cabinet members [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3541.28s)]
*  come in and brief senior staff, and then they and then the senior staff would brief the president. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3547.28s)]
*  And one member of the cabinet put it to us this way. Yes, the president is officially making the [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3552.7200000000003s)]
*  decision, you know, putting the sign dotted line. But if the if the decision is framed in a certain [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3557.6800000000003s)]
*  way, is it really a decision? And are really they the ones making the decision? And there was a [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3564.1600000000003s)]
*  feeling that that they were, you know, putting their hand on the scale one way or another. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3569.92s)]
*  And, you know, some people also felt that this began, you know, as early as 2021, when, you know, [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  the Biden administration, you know, went pretty far to the left of where Joe Biden had been for a lot [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3582.88s)]
*  of his career. And many people attributed to that, to Ron Klain, who is more progressive being chief [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3589.2000000000003s)]
*  of staff, and they felt some people, including the cabinet, felt that if Biden had been 20 years [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3596.24s)]
*  younger, it may have been different. One cabinet member said, you know, he's an old man. He's got [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3601.6s)]
*  four to six hour good hours a day. And if that's the case, sometimes things are missed. You know, [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3607.12s)]
*  he's not in the weeds as much. Yeah. And it's just to be made by other people. Wait, wait, let me [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3613.8399999999997s)]
*  let me keep going. I only have you for seven more minutes. I know you got to you got to date with [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3619.2s)]
*  somebody else. Follow up to you on this, Alex. So right before you guys launched your book, as you [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3622.24s)]
*  know, on Sunday night, they came out with an announcement that he's suffering from prostate [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3629.2s)]
*  cancer that's metastasized to his bones. We've had multiple doctors come out and say that has to be [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3634.72s)]
*  at least a five to seven year run. Some have acknowledged it's a very, very small percentage [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3640.9599999999996s)]
*  who could potentially have like that had prostate cancer that went into the bones, but extremely [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3645.7599999999998s)]
*  rare. Anyway, what do you make of the timing of that announcement? And do you think it's any [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3650.72s)]
*  accident that it came in between you releasing the her audio tapes and on Axios on Saturday, [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3655.9199999999996s)]
*  and you guys releasing your book today? I can tell you, I wrote in a story with Marco Pudo [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3663.68s)]
*  this morning that some people that even worked in the Biden White House are suspicious of the [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3671.2s)]
*  timing and are they are skeptical of it. I don't want to get into skepticism. I try to just report [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3676.64s)]
*  and not speculate. But I can tell you that, you know, some people that worked for him were felt [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3683.2799999999997s)]
*  very strange about the sudden timing of this. And, you know, I'm going to continue to report it out. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3691.12s)]
*  It's obviously very sad. And I also think, you know, we framed this book as a as a tragedy of a man [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3699.92s)]
*  undone. And I think this just further shows that tragic element and also, you know, what how risky [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3705.52s)]
*  it was for him to run for reelection at such an old age. Is that an old shit moment? Is it all an [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3714.56s)]
*  old shit moment where you're like, Oh, my God, the whole book is about his health and a cover up. And [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3721.28s)]
*  we miss the fact that he he's got cancer. He's got terminal cancer. I mean, like, I don't know, is [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3726.24s)]
*  that do you feel like what's your odd? What are your what do you think the odds are? Because your [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3731.92s)]
*  whole book is about how he covers up about his his health problems. So I mean, I mean, you're in an [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3737.12s)]
*  interesting position now as reporters who are continuing to report on politics, and whether you [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3742.8s)]
*  give credence to this story that he just found out, and he didn't know while he was the sitting [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3748.56s)]
*  president, how are you going to how do you handle that? I certainly I certainly understand the [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3754.56s)]
*  skepticism. And I think if there's anything this book instructs us as we should be very skeptical, [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3759.76s)]
*  and we should also demand more from our leaders. When it comes to health records, there was a [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3765.36s)]
*  moment in the book, where Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Democrat of Michigan is with as alone with First [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3770.1600000000003s)]
*  Lady Jill Biden, this is after the debate before but before Biden drops out. And Senator Stabenow [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3777.92s)]
*  says something like, we don't know what's wrong with Joe Biden. We don't know if there's a condition. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3783.36s)]
*  But you do. And First Lady Biden doesn't answer the question and then later fumes about the [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3791.76s)]
*  temerity of Senator Stabenow saying that. And I think what we've learned in the last couple days [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3800.32s)]
*  about President Biden's health, and obviously, I know all of us wish him the best in his fight [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3806.7200000000003s)]
*  against prostate cancer. What I think it gets at is the difficulty of hard reporting and investigative [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3812.4s)]
*  journalism when it comes to health issues. observations and punditry are important and [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3819.6800000000003s)]
*  necessary. But the deep investigation of what is going on behind the scenes and what is going on [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3829.12s)]
*  in terms of somebody's health, that is very tough. And as we all know, we don't have subpoena power. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3837.52s)]
*  We can't break into doctors' offices. I have no reporting on when he found out about this. [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3843.68s)]
*  All we have, all the world has, is their word. And if you believe their word, then you believe [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3850.7200000000003s)]
*  their word. And if you don't, you're left with your skepticism. Yeah, there's certainly reason [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3856.08s)]
*  to doubt their word. Question for you, Jake, on the reportage front, is what do you do with [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3860.16s)]
*  these cabinet secretaries who didn't tell the truth about Biden's mental acuity, but now have [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3865.6s)]
*  told the truth to you, and then they want to come on your show? Maybe some of them will run for [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3873.44s)]
*  president. I mean, now that you know, right, that they are not honest brokers, like you actually [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3878.0s)]
*  know, what do you do about that? It's interesting. I guess I'll cross that bridge when I come to it. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3883.92s)]
*  It has been interesting watching some of the Democrats, and you know, who talked to us for [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3891.68s)]
*  the book, and what they say publicly versus what they say privately. That has been interesting. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3898.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, I saw the one congresswoman who we quote in the book, Susan Wilde, former congresswoman [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3904.64s)]
*  from Pennsylvania, was out there tweeting something like, fuck, Andrew Yang, like, we need to go move [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3908.8799999999997s)]
*  forward and focus on Trump and not Biden. And she's quoted in the book during a meeting, a Zoom [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3915.12s)]
*  meeting of the ranking Democrats, saying something like, Biden can't come to my district, [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3921.36s)]
*  and he makes us all out to be liars. And it's just when it was pointed out to her that what she said, [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3927.2000000000003s)]
*  according to the book, was very different than what she was saying now. She, at least to her credit, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3934.56s)]
*  fessed up to it. She didn't deny it. But it is weird watching the dance between people who know [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3940.56s)]
*  how bad it was and are just keeping quiet or trying to change the subject and those who know [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3947.52s)]
*  how bad it was and are lying to the public. It's interesting. Well, I mean, one of them [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3953.28s)]
*  is Hakeem Jeffries, who you point out in the book. He knew he was there when Biden was having one of [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3959.12s)]
*  his many problems. And now he's out there like, we're moving forward. We're moving forward. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3965.7599999999998s)]
*  Chuck Schumer too, like, we're moving forward. They knew Chuck Schumer's all over your book [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3973.76s)]
*  with big meetings where he went to Joe Biden, which was previously reported, but a lot of details [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3978.7200000000003s)]
*  about him saying, you're not being told the truth. You've got to get out. You're going to lose. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3984.1600000000003s)]
*  You're going to bring us all down. And now he's like, forward, moving forward. Anyway, [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3988.1600000000003s)]
*  okay. Let me keep going. There's two other things I want to ask you about. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3991.1200000000003s)]
*  Jake, we played a soundbite from Mark Halpern's show where he interviewed a guy named Rufus Gifford, [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=3994.6400000000003s)]
*  who is the campaign finance chair for Joe Biden's campaign. And he was at the now infamous Cluny [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4001.36s)]
*  fundraiser for Biden in June of 24. And he took issue with your reporting. We played the audience [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4007.36s)]
*  to soundbite. I won't waste time on it now, but he says it didn't happen. What you report, Cluny [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4014.08s)]
*  did not walk in there. Sorry. Biden did not walk in there and go through a bunch of people saying, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4019.28s)]
*  nice to see you. Nice to see you. Thanks for being here. Thanks for being here. He said that [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4025.1200000000003s)]
*  was impossible because he got there. He was announced by his handler and immediately the [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4028.24s)]
*  handler said, you know, George Cluny, you know, Julia Roberts. He said, nice to meet you and [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4035.84s)]
*  moved on. And he poured cold water on that story of your book. Care to respond? [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4040.48s)]
*  We're pretty confident about the sourcing and the event as described. And, you know, [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4046.08s)]
*  we just went through as a country years and years of the Biden people lying and denying. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4053.04s)]
*  And I'm not particularly interested in pretending any of that is credible. We are very sure of our [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4060.3999999999996s)]
*  story. It wasn't just in our book. It was thoroughly fact checked in The New Yorker, who did an excerpt [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4067.12s)]
*  of it. And we stand by it. And I don't really care what Rufus says. And now do you care what the [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4073.68s)]
*  ladies of the view say? Because that's kind of in your not your personally, but it's in the left [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4081.36s)]
*  wing ecosphere. And they are having a very negative reaction. I'm sorry to tell you to original sin. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4087.28s)]
*  They don't like your book, guys. They don't appreciate that it's being published now. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4093.76s)]
*  And I wonder if they read it. Have they had you on? Have they invited you to come on to discuss it? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4098.16s)]
*  They have. They have not. They have. They have. We have gone to them many number of times and [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4104.400000000001s)]
*  said we would love to come on the show to discuss. They obviously were where President and First Lady [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4108.56s)]
*  Biden went for their prebuttal of the book. And we thought it would be it would only be fair to [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4114.4800000000005s)]
*  have us on. But the view and for that matter, Fox News seems to enjoy using our scoops talking [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4121.52s)]
*  about everything we learned in the months of investigative journalism and what we're revealing [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4129.76s)]
*  in this book. But they're declining to have us on to discuss it, which is regrettable because I [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4133.52s)]
*  think this is an important thing for for people to come to terms with when it comes to the view [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4139.280000000001s)]
*  or to explore in terms of the depth of what we Alex and I have been able to find out in terms of [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4145.4400000000005s)]
*  Fox News. I will say that there is clearly a contingent of people on the left [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4150.4800000000005s)]
*  who want to bury their head in the sand on this issue and pretend it didn't happen and pretend [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4157.360000000001s)]
*  that it's not part of the reason why Donald Trump and the Republicans control the White [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4163.68s)]
*  House and the House and the Senate and why Democratic poll numbers are in the toilet. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4169.4400000000005s)]
*  I think that is part of why Democrats are where they are. This this gaslighting. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4174.400000000001s)]
*  There was a comment by David Axelrod that we should we should set aside the discussion of [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4180.8s)]
*  your book and the allegations in it because of the diagnosis news. Jake, do you disagree with [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4185.280000000001s)]
*  David Axelrod? Well, if I didn't, I don't think I'd be here. I mean, I think what happened to the [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4191.92s)]
*  country. I'm pleased to hear you do. I think we need to be discussing this. I think obviously [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4198.24s)]
*  we have sympathy for President Biden both in terms of the prostate cancer [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4205.36s)]
*  and in terms of whatever other health issue he is grappling with. And we talked to many neurologists [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4208.96s)]
*  who spent you talk about how you are on a text chain with your producers the night of the debate. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4215.2s)]
*  We talked to one of the top neurologists in the in the world who, you know, has is on a text chain [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4220.0s)]
*  with a number of other top neurologists. And they spent much of twenty twenty four trying to figure [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4226.08s)]
*  out what was wrong with Joe Biden, whether it's Lewy body dementia or Parkinson's or something [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4231.04s)]
*  Parkinsonian. And they don't know then they're not qualified to say from a distance. But it's a [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4236.88s)]
*  serious question. And the larger issue of transparency and group think questions for the [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4241.28s)]
*  Democratic Party and the public and the news media. These are all really important conversations to [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4246.88s)]
*  have. I don't think that our story, I don't think that our book is mean. I think it is just accurate [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4251.68s)]
*  and clear eyed. And I think this is a conversation the country needs to have, not just about [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4257.12s)]
*  President Biden, but about all presidents. It's like it's like I tell my kids it is not mean [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4260.64s)]
*  to say something that is true, but not necessarily complimentary. I mean, it's not if it's true and [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4266.96s)]
*  you are not saying it with the intention to hurt somebody, it's not mean. They're not going to get [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4273.92s)]
*  away with that. Sorry, Alex, you wanted to weigh in. Go ahead. I actually just wanted to say one [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4279.2s)]
*  more thing about the media coverage and this question, which is, you know, Jake, when Jake [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4284.96s)]
*  came to me with this idea, you know, on every beat, there are some suck ups, there are some [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4291.04s)]
*  people that are lazy. But I never felt that Jake, even if he fell short on the age issue, [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4296.0s)]
*  I never felt he carried the water for the Biden people. And I hope your listeners who may be [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4301.92s)]
*  skeptical of Jake, at least like give the book a chance. Yes, I don't think we've convinced them [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4307.28s)]
*  that Jake did not run cover for Joe Biden. I'm going to be honest, but I do think we may have [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4312.08s)]
*  convinced them to buy the book, which is the purpose of your visit here. And that's fine. [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4316.4s)]
*  I mean, there's a it's a big media landscape. They don't have to watch the lead. They can take [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4320.16s)]
*  it for what it's worth. I do want to ask you one question about Naomi Biden before I let you go, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4324.8s)]
*  guys. She weighed in. This is the president's former president's granddaughter. She called it [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4328.32s)]
*  a silly book. She says it's a political fairy smut. It is political fairy smut for the permanent [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4332.4s)]
*  professional chattering class. A bunch of unoriginal uninspired lies written by irresponsible [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4338.719999999999s)]
*  self promoting journalists out to make a quick buck relying on unnamed anonymous sources, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4343.44s)]
*  pushing a self serving false narrative. Alex, care to take that on? [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4348.799999999999s)]
*  I mean, I think the book very much shows the Biden family is very tight knit, and I wasn't [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4353.12s)]
*  surprised to see it. That being said, I think we stand completely behind our reporting. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4362.0s)]
*  All right. And Jake, I'll close with this. You've gotten so much blowback [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4367.76s)]
*  in the days that led up to today. Had to hire the crisis PR agent. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4371.5199999999995s)]
*  How are you feeling so far? All right, whatever. But you've gotten a lot of blowback. So how are [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4377.6s)]
*  you feeling today? Telling the truth is always worth it. We hired Risa Heller because she's a [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4382.56s)]
*  political pro and months ago. Well, you had a PR agent through your publisher. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4390.72s)]
*  Yeah. And they're great. But this is a very controversial political book. And we felt like [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4397.52s)]
*  it needed the eyes of a smart political team in addition to the great publicists at Penguin. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4402.64s)]
*  I get it. But you're not denying that you've had massive blowback, are you? I mean, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4409.52s)]
*  you've been under attack for days now. Oh, the left and the right are mad. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4412.8s)]
*  Exactly. The left is like, why are you covering this? You should be covering Trump. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4418.56s)]
*  Your book is full of lies. And the right is doing what you illustrated earlier with your tough [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4424.72s)]
*  questions. I will say this. People were shocked on June 27 2024, because there was to a degree, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4430.56s)]
*  a cover up of how bad his decline had been. So even if and even if, even though many folks, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4439.4400000000005s)]
*  including you, were covering this, it still was shocking what people saw on June 27. And the only [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4448.240000000001s)]
*  other point I'll say is, I'm not disagreeing with the fact that conservatives were right on this, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4456.88s)]
*  and that people in the legacy media, including myself, should have been paying [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4464.32s)]
*  closer attention and more attention. I'm granting all of that. But the reason why I think there is [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4468.32s)]
*  interest in this book is because people want to know more beyond what they saw in front of the [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4474.64s)]
*  camera. They want to know how this happened. And I think that is what we provide through this [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4481.68s)]
*  deeply sourced unflinching account of what really went on behind the scenes. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4487.280000000001s)]
*  I got to steal one more minute because I just want to explain to the audience, Jake, how Jake [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4493.04s)]
*  Tapper and Megyn Kelly became friends, because it's a very unlikely friendship in the eyes of a lot [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4497.52s)]
*  of people. But we've both been in media for a long time. We were at Fox and CNN together. We were [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4503.76s)]
*  friends even before you went to CNN. I remember texting with you about the decision when you were [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4511.12s)]
*  leaving ABC. Where would you go? What did you want to do? We've bonded over news and its insanity. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4515.12s)]
*  We've bonded over the Philadelphia Eagles and your shared love with my husband Doug of that [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4521.44s)]
*  very complicated football team. And I want people to understand, notwithstanding that we have [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4527.12s)]
*  political differences and we have differences in the way we see news stories, there's still room for [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4532.5599999999995s)]
*  mutual respect and kindness and friendship. And I think that's to our credit. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4537.2s)]
*  I consider you a friend. I don't necessarily agree with everything you do or say, but that doesn't [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4544.48s)]
*  really matter. And I think it's interesting what you've done and impressive what you've built [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4550.08s)]
*  since that, you know, you know what I think about what happened to you at NBC. It's flattering to [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4557.2s)]
*  you and not to them. But yeah, and look, I mean, one of the things that you've said to me or said [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4563.52s)]
*  about me is that I might not always succeed, but I try to be fair. And I'm trying to be fair and I'm [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4570.72s)]
*  not infallible. And I have said, I wish I had covered things differently. There's a million [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4577.120000000001s)]
*  things I wish I'd covered differently. This is obviously significant, more significant. I wrote [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4582.4800000000005s)]
*  a book about it with Alex. I mean, like, I think this is a big deal. But this book isn't me trying [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4586.320000000001s)]
*  to do anything other than what happened. We need to know what happened. And if somebody had written [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4591.92s)]
*  this book, I would have bought it. And I would have interviewed them. But they hadn't. And Alex [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4598.16s)]
*  and I got to work knowing that there would be a huge blowback, both from the right and from the [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4603.76s)]
*  left. And it was just important for us to tell the story of what happened. Well, listen, I appreciate [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4611.04s)]
*  it because I did learn a lot. And I did find the debate absolutely shocking, though, as I say, [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4618.88s)]
*  not entirely surprising, right? It's like the extent to which he had deteriorated was shocking. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4623.4400000000005s)]
*  And by the way, before you go, thank you for all you do for our veterans as well. Guys, good luck [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4630.32s)]
*  with it. I'm sure it's going to be a big success. It is called Original Sin, President Biden's [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4634.72s)]
*  Decline, its cover up and his disastrous choice to run again. And it is available right now. All the [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4639.84s)]

*  under attack every single day. And one of the biggest casualties, our digestion. Millions of [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4664.64s)]
*  people suffer with indigestion, bloating, upset stomach. But here's the good news. We don't have [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4669.84s)]
*  to just accept this. Our ancestors had the answer all along. Bitter foods. Bitter herbs and plants [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4674.88s)]

*  Sargon is here now. She's a free press columnist and author of the book Second Class, How the [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4725.84s)]
*  Elites Betrayed America's Working Men and Women. Bhatia, last week I interviewed your hero, [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4731.92s)]
*  Sean O'Brien of the Teamsters. I thought of you. He was just as awesome as you believe he is. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4738.16s)]
*  And today, I don't think these were your heroes, but it was an interesting hour and a half. Your [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4745.04s)]
*  thoughts? Well, first of all, you were heroic. That interview was a masterclass in how to be [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4749.68s)]
*  both fair but also vigorous and representing your audience in the pursuit of truth. So, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4756.5599999999995s)]
*  Megan, huge kudos. I enjoyed every minute of it. It was just truly so inspiring. And as you always [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4762.24s)]
*  do, a masterclass in real journalism, a few things really stood out to me. The first being [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4768.959999999999s)]
*  that he acknowledged that conservative media had gotten this right, that conservatives across the [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4774.719999999999s)]
*  country, Republicans, realized this. In fact, a lot of Democrats realized this. My question that [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4782.0s)]
*  was left unanswered was, okay, so what are you going to do going forward to increase your humility [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4788.08s)]
*  a little bit vis-a-vis conservatives and Republicans who got this right? Why did they get it right? [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4796.08s)]
*  I think we know the answer to that. Right, exactly. Right. He's talking about bringing [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4802.4s)]
*  humility to that moment with Laura Trump, but that moment was, as you pointed out, Megan, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4807.68s)]
*  fueled by contempt for how conservatives and Republicans see the world. And that question [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4812.320000000001s)]
*  really he could not answer you, Megan, which is he admits that he should have done a better job at [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4819.6s)]
*  the time. Okay, why didn't you? And of course, Megan, the answer is very clear because the [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4824.16s)]
*  interests of the legacy media and the interests of the Democratic Party in covering this up were one [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4829.52s)]
*  and the same. The mainstream media gaslit the American people because they didn't want Donald [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4835.76s)]
*  Trump to win. They have chosen a side. And I think that this is such an important point going [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4841.2s)]
*  forward because in a way, Joe Biden is really being scapegoated here. The reason that Jake [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4846.0s)]
*  Tapper got the access now was because all of the people who did the covering up were certain that [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4852.96s)]
*  he, like the mainstream media, is still on the side of the Democratic Party. And so it is in their [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4860.08s)]
*  interest to act like all of the crimes were at Joe Biden's feet and his little coterie. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4865.44s)]
*  And if we just put all of the crime there, we can move forward. And it's a way really, Megan, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4871.5199999999995s)]
*  of hiding the fact that the Democrats have actually nothing to offer the American people [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4877.28s)]
*  going forward in terms of a platform. So if they can only scapegoat Joe Biden enough, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4882.16s)]
*  maybe nobody will notice. It's a bit of a like a laundering of what really went down, right? It's [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4886.639999999999s)]
*  like, had we known, we definitely would have done something, but this cabal around him was hiding it. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4893.12s)]
*  But there's a little truth in that story because I believe there was this cabal, this Pollock Bureau, [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4899.28s)]
*  Mike Donilon and Steve Richetti, as he points out in the others, who were hiding the worst of the [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4904.5599999999995s)]
*  worst of it. I do believe that. If you read the book, you'll walk away believing that too. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4910.08s)]
*  Doesn't mean we were in the dark, but they were actively working to cover up just how bad he had [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4914.32s)]
*  gotten and to run him again. I mean, they wanted to keep it a secret so that we would put him back [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4920.4s)]
*  in the office. And I believe, I don't have the proof yet, but I believe he was also diagnosed [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4925.839999999999s)]
*  with a terminal illness and they hid that from us too. Yeah. I don't think anybody could possibly [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4931.36s)]
*  believe at this point that it's an accident, that the horrifying and truly sad cancer diagnosis [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4938.0s)]
*  was discovered the day before this book was supposed to come out. That just beggars belief [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4945.68s)]
*  at this point. It's ridiculous. They think we're fools. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4951.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that the fact that they've gotten to this place where the lies have finally [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4955.599999999999s)]
*  caught up with them is very significant. And I don't want to minimize what President Biden himself [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4960.8s)]
*  did in defrauding the American people in this way, what Jill Biden did, what that inner Coturian [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4966.64s)]
*  cabal did. But I struggle, Megan, to point to a single policy decision that Joe Biden made [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4972.24s)]
*  that I don't think a president Kamala Harris would have made or president Gavin Newsom or a [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4979.44s)]
*  different person would have made had he not run again. And had there been an open primary, [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4984.8s)]
*  those policies he enacted that were deeply unpopular, those are the democratic party's [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4990.24s)]
*  policies. And so in a way, I think this is a bit of a distraction from that. Of course, [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4995.36s)]
*  it's hugely criminal what happened here and worthy of discussing. But at the end of the day, [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=4999.2s)]
*  the reason that there are people who are now willing to speak to someone like Jake Tapper [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5004.32s)]
*  is because they're hoping we won't realize the bigger problem here. [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5008.72s)]
*  The news I reference on Hakeem Jeffries, he's out there now, the Democrats leader in the House, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5013.5199999999995s)]
*  saying it's completely inappropriate, entirely inappropriate for Republicans to be discussing [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5017.76s)]
*  these, quote, conspiracy theories around Joe Biden and his cancer diagnosis in connection now [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5022.8s)]
*  with these books. And given the news that he has cancer, this is totally inappropriate. These are [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5030.08s)]
*  conspiracy theories. That guy knew, he knew, and the book points out, here's just one example from [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5036.24s)]
*  Chapter 11, now that we're at liberty to discuss the contents of the book. There was a meeting [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5041.360000000001s)]
*  with President Biden on Ukraine and House and Senate Democrats and some GOPers January 17th, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5046.72s)]
*  2024. And let's see, hold on. Let's see. He stumbled over words. He started sentences, [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5052.72s)]
*  then stopped abruptly. He trailed off. Months later, when the Wall Street Journal reporters began [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5060.4800000000005s)]
*  hearing that the official readout of what happened at the meeting did not reflect reality, the Biden [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5064.160000000001s)]
*  White House circled the wagons and enlisted allies to push the narrative that in the meeting, Biden [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5068.8s)]
*  was, quote, incredibly strong, forceful, indecisive, as leader Hakeem Jeffries insisted. After reading [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5073.84s)]
*  Jeffries' quote, a House Democrat who had been at the meeting responded, quote, that's not true. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5079.6s)]
*  A second House Democrat who was also there, quote, it was a disaster. It was a shit show. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5083.84s)]
*  One unnamed senior administration official. I can just never forgive this guy. Now this guy's running [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5088.88s)]
*  out there trying to tell us to shut up and stop talking about any of this, including the cancer [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5093.280000000001s)]
*  diagnosis, or we're conspiratorial ghouls. Yeah, I mean, obviously this is insanity, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5098.240000000001s)]
*  right? It's good to know what happened. It's good to know who lied and who is still lying and who [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5104.88s)]
*  is still carrying water for Joe Biden. But to me, Megan, the people who are now willing to come out [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5111.12s)]
*  against Joe Biden, kind of like George Clooney, who when this became undeniable to the American [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5118.24s)]
*  people, only then was he willing to admit what the rest of America had already seen with their own [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5125.04s)]
*  eyes. Those people who are now coming out against Joe Biden, now that he has no power, [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5130.48s)]
*  like to me, there's something about that that is also deeply disturbing because of course, [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5136.959999999999s)]
*  the reason they're doing it now is it's a power grab, right? They want power back. Jake Tapper [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5142.719999999999s)]
*  wants us now to trust him again on his show because he's willing to talk about somebody who can no [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5148.24s)]
*  longer hurt him for telling the truth about him, right? Biden is down and out. He has cancer. He [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5155.6s)]
*  is no longer a threat to anybody in power in the Democratic Party. That doesn't mean that we [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5162.400000000001s)]
*  shouldn't be talking about what went down there, but what it does mean is the people speaking the [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5167.76s)]
*  loudest now about everything that happened. Ask yourselves why they're willing to do that now, [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5172.64s)]
*  and it's because they're trying to get trust back from the American people by now telling the truth [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5177.84s)]
*  about someone who can no longer hurt them for doing so, but they will never reevaluate, for example, [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5183.76s)]
*  how they talk about Donald Trump. And that is very upsetting because of course, the people who don't [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5188.8s)]
*  want to talk in this negative way constantly about Donald Trump are the people who knew the truth [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5194.88s)]
*  about Joe Biden and were willing to admit it then. Who could see it and had no problem admitting it. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5199.12s)]
*  They could see it too, but they did have a problem admitting it. I do want to tell you this one thing. [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5203.92s)]
*  George Clooney delay from between the time he saw an infirm Biden at that fundraiser and then not [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5208.4s)]
*  publishing that op-ed in the New York Times until weeks later, nearly a month later, they write that [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5215.04s)]
*  George had compartmentalized his encounter with the president at that LA fundraiser, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5220.16s)]
*  chalking it up to the president's 81 spins around the sun and the long fucking trip from Italy. This [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5226.88s)]
*  is obviously straight from Clooney. That's my own speculation, even if Biden had flown in on Air [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5233.04s)]
*  Force One, but then the debate had confirmed all the fears he had shoved aside those that he had [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5237.76s)]
*  compartmentalized Batya and yet the compartment opened up and the compartments began speaking [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5244.72s)]
*  to one another and then George Clooney to the rescue with his op-ed in July. It's amazing. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5251.36s)]
*  I mean Clooney really emerges from this as one of the chief villains along with President Obama. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5258.64s)]
*  He knew and didn't tell until everybody else knew. That moment where George Clooney, [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5265.68s)]
*  we assume, or somebody told Tapper and Thompson that George Clooney had not recognized Joe Biden [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5272.96s)]
*  at the fundraiser and then of course on Mark Halpern's show as you pointed out, there was [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5278.8s)]
*  another version of that story told. It's possible that both versions are true, Megan, because it's [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5283.52s)]
*  possible that what happened is George Clooney just did not get the reception that he felt he was owed [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5289.6s)]
*  and interpreted that as Joe Biden not recognizing who he was. The absolute arrogance here that he [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5296.400000000001s)]
*  should be the one to decide the future of the Democratic Party, him attempting to get credit [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5304.56s)]
*  for basically stabbing Biden in the back after he could no longer hide what he had access [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5310.56s)]
*  to, what he knew because he was so wealthy and such an elite. I mean this to me really was the [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5317.52s)]
*  cherry on the cake here. It reeks. And now again, trying to launder his reputation for what purpose [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5323.44s)]
*  to get power back. That's what this whole story is about. Clooney knows he's vulnerable. That's [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5331.52s)]
*  my belief is he definitely talked to Tapper. Tapper interviewed him about his show on Broadway. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5336.72s)]
*  And so they definitely, we know that they've spoken and I don't know that they've spoken [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5342.240000000001s)]
*  about this, but it certainly seems like they have. And that's his, that clearly, I feel like we've [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5347.12s)]
*  now been given George's defense to not coming up. I compartmentalized it was like hidden trauma. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5350.88s)]
*  Maybe he did some like psychedelics that brought out what the trauma of what happened at that [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5357.360000000001s)]
*  fundraiser. Oh no wait, it was the debate that ruined his electoral chances. There was no worse [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5362.72s)]
*  actor, whatever your feelings about Tapper, no worse actor in covering up the Biden dementia [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5368.96s)]
*  than Joe Scarborough. Number one, there were plenty of people at CNN, Oliver Darcy, Brian Stelter, [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5375.68s)]
*  Chris Aliza. Believe me, I've been neck deep in all of their sins in preparation for this interview. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5382.0s)]
*  But Scarborough blew them all out of the water with his, this is the best Joe Biden ever ever [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5388.16s)]
*  roll the tape. Well, guess what? He went on Mark Halpern show next up part of the MK media network. [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5393.12s)]
*  It drops later today. We have a sneak preview for you of Mark pressing him on this issue. This is [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5398.32s)]
*  fun. Watch. But looking back at that, do you say, well, it was misleading to say best by never [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5405.599999999999s)]
*  without caveatting it and say, except on the days when he's not the best Biden. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5411.2s)]
*  Yeah. Well, but I never, I never saw those days personally. Well, you did. You did because you [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5414.8s)]
*  saw him address a dead Congresswoman and you saw him in South Carolina. A dead Congresswoman, yeah. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5420.56s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I mean, I can show you the RNC clip reels. There were plenty of days in public [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5425.28s)]
*  when he, when he was not the best Biden ever. And of course, he stumbled and he stumbled and [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5431.2s)]
*  bumbled around Mark. I mean, yeah, he, he certainly did. Donald Trump did, other politicians did. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5436.64s)]
*  Based on what I saw with the Biden, based on the time that I spent with Biden, based on the [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5442.72s)]
*  hundreds of hours that I talked to people who talked to Biden and people that worked with Biden [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5448.240000000001s)]
*  and were with him day in and day out. Good friends that I know that I, that I trusted [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5455.12s)]
*  before Biden was president, that I trust now that Biden's not president. I mean, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5460.64s)]
*  put it in the proper context. I'm just not going to freak out and melt down on one or two clips [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5464.56s)]
*  here or there. That's a lie. Every word of that is a lie. And he's still lying, Batya. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5470.16s)]
*  I think the thing that is most important to keep in mind is that none of this would have been [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5481.2s)]
*  possible if we had a functioning media that had respect for the American people. It is their [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5485.36s)]
*  utter contempt for anyone who doesn't vote for their chosen people that allowed this to happen. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5492.72s)]
*  Because as you pointed out, Megan, again and again, you had this story. You were showing the clips. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5500.16s)]
*  Anybody listening to your program or any conservative media was exposed to this. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5508.8s)]
*  Right. Definitely not just me. So much so that even Democratic voters [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5513.76s)]
*  understood that he was too old. And it is their utter contempt for Republicans, for people who [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5518.0s)]
*  vote for Trump, for working class people, for the normies of this country who were looking at this, [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5524.48s)]
*  looking at the footage and saying, this is not okay, that allowed this to happen. And so what I [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5531.28s)]
*  want to know is what are you in the media going to do to correct the character defect that has [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5537.28s)]
*  allowed you to think you are so much better and so much more important than average working class [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5545.44s)]
*  Americans that you can tell them not to believe what they're seeing with their own eyes? And of [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5552.08s)]
*  course, Megan, this all has to do with the class divide and the fact that journalists are part of [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5557.599999999999s)]
*  the elites, that the vast majority of American journalists are in the top 10%. These are people [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5562.4s)]
*  who have degrees from elite institutions, which actually make them much worse at their job. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5568.639999999999s)]
*  Because they think they are so much smarter and so much better and so much more educated than average [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5575.44s)]
*  people. The people telling the great American story absolutely hate the American people. That [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5582.48s)]
*  is the only way you end up in a situation like this, Megan. Well, this gets to really the heart [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5589.44s)]
*  of the issue because I don't forgive any one of those Biden aides for covering this story up and [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5596.4s)]
*  lying and misleading. But I'm also not shocked. I mean, politicians lie. The circles around them [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5604.08s)]
*  lie. It's happened since the dawn of time. But it is the press's job to try to expose those lies. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5611.28s)]
*  It is our reason for being to press those who are in power to get to the truth. And the more blowback [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5619.5199999999995s)]
*  you get, the more you generally know you're right over the target. And the book actually has a story [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5628.08s)]
*  of some unnamed female reporter who got her cage rattled pretty significantly by the White House as [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5633.6s)]
*  she was about to come out with an article on the mental acuity. Alex Thompson got brushed back from [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5638.160000000001s)]
*  the White House too. There's a story about the James Rosen moment at that presser where Biden [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5643.68s)]
*  showed up at the White House briefing room and James asked him directly, people don't believe you [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5648.72s)]
*  can do this job with respect. What are they getting wrong? And how Jill Biden freaked out after it and [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5653.68s)]
*  yelled at the staff. Why didn't somebody stop him? Why didn't somebody interrupt like they were going [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5662.0s)]
*  to try to interrupt the reporter in the middle of his question? Ridiculous. So whatever, that's what [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5666.0s)]
*  they do. But the press's job is to test these claims and to make sure we're not being spun [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5670.64s)]
*  and that we're not part of the lying conspiracy. You know, Watergate was a group of officials [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5677.6s)]
*  lying to us, doing bad things, and then lying to us about what they did. And the reason we know that [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5685.44s)]
*  it happened is because you had a press corps that wanted to investigate Republicans and did, [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5690.16s)]
*  but we're just missing part two right now, at least in the so-called legacy press. And that's [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5696.8s)]
*  why people are having such a difficult time with his book, at least insofar as Jake is one of the [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5702.639999999999s)]
*  authors, because they're like, you can't investigate yourself. And the book without the chapter that [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5706.16s)]
*  has his mea culpa isn't persuasive to people. And I think beyond that, Megan, it's not like the press [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5711.92s)]
*  doesn't know how to do it when there's a Republican president in office. And I think that is what is so [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5722.4s)]
*  upsetting to so many Americans is we see you guys do this every single day. If there is a Republican [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5730.88s)]
*  in office, suddenly you remember how to do good journalism. Suddenly you remember that you should [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5739.28s)]
*  not give the benefit of the doubt to people with power, that it is your job to represent the [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5745.2s)]
*  American people. Of course, they go too far, right? I mean, their attacks on the Trump administration [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5749.599999999999s)]
*  are completely in excess of what I think average Americans would think are appropriate. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5755.2s)]
*  But it's just become so clear that the vast majority of the legacy mainstream media are in the can for [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5759.36s)]
*  one of the political parties and yet want the respect of being the fourth estate holding power [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5766.56s)]
*  to account when actually what they're doing is attacking Republicans because it is in their [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5774.240000000001s)]
*  interests to do that because they are on the side of the Democrats. And the reason they're on the [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5780.240000000001s)]
*  side of the Democrats is not just because of liberalism, but because Democrats represent the [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5784.96s)]
*  elites and they are part of the elites. And that really, I think, is the take home message here. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5789.76s)]
*  Mm-hmm. There was an exchange on Jake's show yesterday about the former president's diagnosis. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5794.48s)]
*  And just to your question about whether there'll be a new leaf turned over, and the discussion [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5803.679999999999s)]
*  was all about how hard the Bidens have had it, what a difficult life he's had, suffered a lot [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5809.599999999999s)]
*  of tragedy and so on. There was not deep probing. There was no probing into the timing of the [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5814.719999999999s)]
*  announcement. Even though it's Jake's book that was coming out the next day, I just don't think [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5820.64s)]
*  there's any desire from anyone, anyone on CNN, nevermind MSNBC or any of these so-called [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5826.160000000001s)]

*  point is like, I don't know if I even want it to. We do need a robust press. They weren't wrong that [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5861.2s)]

*  reading it was so many of the stories that you and I have been discussing for years now, right? Like, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=5996.799999999999s)]
*  we knew, like I said to them about the jump cuts in those Biden videos, like you knew, you knew. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6002.4s)]
*  Do we have that, Deb? Do we have that thought? Here, we're going to show you the example. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6008.16s)]
*  And it's been confirmed in this book that they had to videotape him so many times from so many [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6015.52s)]
*  different camera angles and then try to splice it together because he couldn't spit out two sentences. [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6020.8s)]
*  Do we have it? Let's watch. Donald Trump lost two debates to me in 2020. Since then, he hadn't [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6024.96s)]
*  shown up for debate. Now he's acting like he wants to debate me again. Well, make my day, pal. I'll [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6030.16s)]
*  even do it twice. So let's pick the dates, Donald. I hear you're free on Wednesdays. [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6035.44s)]
*  Yeah. So that's, we're not surprised, but it is confirmed in this book that that's what he was [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6042.4s)]
*  doing. That's what they were doing. They were trying to get enough cuts of him that they could [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6049.04s)]
*  make it usable. And sometimes it didn't work. Sometimes it did. And then they would cringe [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6052.48s)]
*  when they saw people like us discussing how it was obvious. They were really hoping they could [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6057.2s)]
*  pull the wool over. There was this discussion with TJ Ducklow. It's SOT6. It's from September 2020. [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6060.96s)]
*  We played this. This is back when we were just babies, the show, and we talked about it, where [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6071.6s)]
*  he was a deputy campaign or deputy press secretary for the Biden campaign. And Brett Baer got in his [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6077.28s)]
*  grill about whether Biden was using a teleprompter during campaign events. Watch. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6085.28s)]
*  Has Joe Biden ever used a teleprompter during local interviews or to answer Q&A with supporters? [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6090.32s)]
*  Brett, we are not going to, this is straight from the Trump campaign. [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6096.5599999999995s)]
*  But yeah, they're using it. [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6100.08s)]
*  And what it does, and what it does, Brett, is it's trying to distract the American people, [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6101.12s)]
*  Brett. They talk about it every day because they don't have a coherent argument for why [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6105.28s)]
*  Donald Trump deserves reelection. But you can't answer the question. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6108.88s)]
*  Brett, I am not going to allow a Trump campaign to funnel their questions through Fox News and get me [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6111.76s)]
*  to respond to that. It was true. He was using a teleprompter both at campaign events and to deal [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6117.12s)]
*  even at private fundraisers, some of which if he had to do it online, he would use a [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6126.08s)]
*  prompter. And if he did it in person, the use of no cards. And they actually reported that they would [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6131.76s)]
*  write down the Qs and the As. President Biden would have both. [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6138.32s)]
*  And then the donors at these donor events would be given the pre-written Qs from the Biden team. [[01:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6142.56s)]
*  It was just a question of like, who would get which one? But no one came up with their own [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6149.6s)]
*  question. Nothing would get asked that hadn't been pre-screened and come up with by Biden's staff. [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6153.6s)]
*  We talked a little bit with the guys about how they were cleansing the White House of as many [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6160.160000000001s)]
*  resident staffers as they could so that they couldn't see Biden in the elevator and elsewhere. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6165.4400000000005s)]
*  They report that one senior White House aide left, quit, because this person didn't think [[01:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6169.92s)]
*  Biden should run again, confessed that, quote, we attempted to shield him from his own staff. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6175.759999999999s)]
*  So many people did not realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023. So this person had [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6181.679999999999s)]
*  had enough of the cover up, but admitted that they'd been attempting to shield everybody. [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6186.08s)]
*  The White House staff treated him as quote, very delicate. Many of his own aides were kept at arms [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6190.8s)]
*  length. He met mostly with that so-called Politburo and his top national security aides. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6196.56s)]
*  They do indict in that way, Jake Sullivan and Antony Blinken as on the inner circle and [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6201.84s)]
*  people who knew. There were no cards handed out for all cabinet meetings. And there too, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6208.88s)]
*  he increasingly relied more on cards and prescripted exchanges, even when it was in private. [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6214.4800000000005s)]
*  Four cabinet secretaries told them, quote, the cabinet meetings were terrible. And at times [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6222.0s)]
*  uncomfortable. And they were from the beginning. I don't recall a great cabinet meeting in terms [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6226.08s)]
*  of his presence. They were so scripted. A second cabinet secretary told them, I hated the scripts [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6230.8s)]
*  for these meetings. You want people to tell you the truth and have a real dialogue. Those meetings [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6236.64s)]
*  were not that. David Axelrod, when he came out at one point and made a comment, you may remember [[01:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6241.36s)]
*  this about Joe Biden's age and whether like, that he'd be closer to 90 than 80 by the end of his [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6246.08s)]
*  second term. Remember that he got his hand slapped by chief of staff, Ron Klain. There's nobody else [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6251.68s)]
*  acts. There's nobody else. He's the only one who's beaten Trump. And you hear that a lot in this book. [[01:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6257.280000000001s)]
*  That's why they did the big coverup. They thought only the master Joe Biden who beat Trump in 2020 [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6262.08s)]
*  could beat him again. And by the way, Mike Donald is all over this book too. He's the one who at the [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6268.0s)]
*  bitter end was not showing Biden his polls. Chuck Schumer had to go in there and tell Biden the truth. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6274.08s)]
*  And this guy, Mike Donald knew in 2019, Biden was forgetting Mike Donald's name on an eight day [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6279.84s)]
*  bus tour in Iowa. A guy had been with him for 30 years and Joe could not remember his name. He knew. [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6285.2s)]
*  Okay. Going on back in 2020, when they were campaigning him the first time around during COVID, [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6293.12s)]
*  they read that voters were coming out of Biden's events, less likely to support him. [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6299.2s)]
*  Precinct captains disappeared or said no thanks after attending a Biden rally. They did report, [[01:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6304.64s)]
*  as you heard in the interview, that the first signs were after Bo died in 2015, which I believe [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6311.84s)]
*  that can have a way of deteriorating somebody's mental health in general. In March of 2020, [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6316.4800000000005s)]
*  March 2nd, they refer to this time he forgot the words of the declaration of independence. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6322.16s)]
*  I'm just going to read you what he actually said. It's on tape, but I'll read it because it's just [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6326.72s)]
*  kind of, sorry, amusing. We hold these truths to be self-evident. All men and women are created by [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6330.32s)]
*  the thing. April 2020 on CNN. This is on CNN. He struggled to explain the coronavirus. [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6338.4s)]
*  During World War, where Roosevelt came up with the thing that was totally different than the, [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6349.5199999999995s)]

*  That was, by the way, before the Laura Trump interview. That was before the Laura Trump [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6371.76s)]
*  interview, which was in October of 2020. So it was no mystery that Joe Biden was deteriorating, [[01:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6379.360000000001s)]
*  and there was plenty of speculation, and there should have been more about his cognitive decline. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6385.28s)]
*  They talk about how it came as a surprise to everybody in the White House that he was [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6390.0s)]
*  announcing a second run, that he was going to run again because there was this understanding [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6394.16s)]
*  that he was going to be a transitional president and only be one term. And it was kind of announced [[01:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6398.0s)]
*  to them by Joe's top guy and by this guy who is Jill Biden's chief of staff. And they get into [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6402.72s)]
*  this meeting with French president Emmanuel Macron, where she let the cat out of the bag [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6411.84s)]
*  for apparently the first time. It was a meeting in December of 2022 between Macron, [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6418.88s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, her daughter Alexandria. Alexandra Pelosi was there. Jill was there. And they write [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6426.5599999999995s)]
*  that Jill started talking about getting in shape for the upcoming campaign. You know, [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6433.12s)]
*  you've got to be your best. And Joe looked totally clueless and didn't seem to have any [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6438.96s)]
*  idea what she was talking about because Alexandra Pelosi looked at him and said, [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6443.68s)]
*  oh, do you have an announcement to make? He looked totally clueless. So not surprisingly, [[01:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6446.4800000000005s)]
*  she was pushing it from the beginning. She wanted him out there and she didn't care [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6451.6s)]
*  how badly that racehorse was hurt. She wanted it to run on the bad leg. That's Jill Biden. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6457.84s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, they report that before state visits from foreign leaders, [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6465.28s)]
*  Jill Biden's team asked for talking points with which national security officials were like, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6471.44s)]
*  what? Why does the first lady need talking points before a state that you're supposed to like, [[01:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6477.2s)]
*  look pretty and be diplomatic? You're not the president's sweetheart. And you're not a doctor [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6483.04s)]
*  either. That she frequently asked White House personnel like Rear Admiral John Kirby, [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6487.6s)]
*  who's a spokesperson over at the Pentagon, to attend her briefings about state dinners. [[01:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6495.280000000001s)]
*  She thought she was president, guys. Those pictures of her with like his jacket behind [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6500.320000000001s)]
*  the her chair at his desk. She really, she might've been president, to be honest. She might've been. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6505.84s)]
*  The she and that Politburo were making the calls. They, let's see going forward. Oh, [[01:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6513.84s)]
*  this is a great story about the Biden Victory Fund razor. Okay. I got to find this one in my [[01:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6521.4400000000005s)]
*  notes here so I can read it to you exactly. Where is it? Give me one second to find it. [[01:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6528.24s)]
*  Where is it? Well, I can't find it in front of me, but I know [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6535.6s)]
*  it's way towards the back. Wait a minute. Oh, I found it. Okay. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6540.16s)]
*  So this is a group of Hollywood people watching the debate in June of 2024. And those people [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6548.48s)]
*  included among others, Rob Reiner, Jane Fonda, and Doug Emhoff, Kamala Harris's husband was there. [[01:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6554.8s)]
*  They report a few minutes into the debate and the obvious meltdown. Rob Reiner in the main living [[01:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6563.44s)]
*  room stated plainly, we are fucked a few seats away. Jane Fonda was equally distraught. Reiner [[01:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6569.2s)]
*  became angry. Soon he was venting, standing, full of fury. He seemed to be looking at Doug Emhoff, [[01:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6577.2s)]
*  daggers. Quote, we're going to lose our fucking democracy because of you. Reiner yelled, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6584.08s)]
*  because of me? Emhoff thought. So obviously they talked to Emhoff because how else would they know [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6591.44s)]
*  what was in his head? Biden Victory Fund's finance chair, Chris Korge was overheard saying, [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6596.72s)]
*  we are totally fucked. This is over. It's over. All over. Donors were putting their heads in their [[01:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6603.84s)]
*  hands. That's a bit of color, don't you think? That's kind of interesting. Oh, and Hakeem [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6610.72s)]
*  Jeffries, who's now like, move forward. There's nothing to see here. There was a debate watch [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6616.08s)]
*  party sponsored by the caucus vice chair, Ted Lieu. And after the debate, a number of Democrats, [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6622.08s)]
*  they report surrounded Hakeem Jeffries, worried. What just happened is not acceptable. One of them [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6627.84s)]
*  said, something has to be done. They wondered, does he have a bad illness? Is there some sort [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6633.68s)]
*  of psychological thing that's temporary? Some believe there was no way he could stay in the [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6639.28s)]
*  race after what they had just seen. And Jeffries told them, calm is an intentional decision. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6643.76s)]
*  So, I mean, he knew he was trying to quiet the troops. Let's see. Reaction from Biden's own [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6650.320000000001s)]
*  staff during the debate inside the White House and at campaign headquarters. Some aides were [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6656.400000000001s)]
*  defiant. Others were panicking. Many were feeling fury. Is he okay? Devastated. The realization of [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6660.0s)]
*  the worst case scenario. Okay, let me keep going. There's more. Okay. Oh, I love this one. [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6667.6s)]
*  They have a lot of examples of how poorly he was doing. But this one dovetailed perfectly [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6679.679999999999s)]
*  with so many that we had seen. You remember when he kept reading the things out loud like, [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6684.88s)]
*  please clap. And the anchor directions or the teleprompter directions, he kept reading them [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6689.5199999999995s)]
*  out loud like applause. I shouldn't laugh, but I'm going to. Here's one I hadn't known about. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6698.96s)]
*  There was a progressive caucus meeting with him Saturday, July 13th, 2024. [[01:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6706.64s)]
*  Pramaya Jayapal, remember her? She was one of the squad had reached out to the president's team [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6714.08s)]
*  to set up a zoom call with the congressional progressive caucus. The Biden team set it up [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6719.92s)]
*  for that day. Throughout the call, Biden was defensive and angry in a way that many members [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6724.88s)]
*  of the congressional caucus, progressive caucus had never seen before. He insisted [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6729.6s)]
*  that he was the real progressive in the room. It was insane. One of them later said Jayapal was [[01:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6736.4s)]
*  texting Biden's team during the meeting and she let them know that it wasn't going well. He was [[01:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6742.32s)]
*  getting way too defensive. A staffer in the room with Biden got the message, wrote it out and handed [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6747.04s)]
*  it to him. Biden read it aloud. Stay positive. You are sounding defensive. Oh my God, you guys. [[01:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6752.16s)]
*  I mean, okay. You're not shocked, but I mean, it's good to know these details. Is it not? [[01:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6764.0s)]
*  I'm enjoying it. Biden began prepping. His team began prepping with news of the day cards for him [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6770.08s)]
*  in late 2021. It began with a presidential cue card with news of the day in case reporters asked [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6778.96s)]
*  him something. By 2023, the news card had morphed into several cards a day, each bearing information [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6784.24s)]
*  that Biden's own aides sometimes felt was quote elementary. Here's the part about the cameras. [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6789.28s)]
*  Biden often couldn't make it through one or two minutes on camera doing video addresses or [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6796.8s)]
*  keynoting an event without stumbling. To compensate, aides began filming him with two cameras instead [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6802.5599999999995s)]
*  of one. If Biden messed up, the edit was less obvious with the jump cut. Other politicians [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6808.5599999999995s)]
*  use jump cuts, but Biden aides noted to themselves how much more often they had to use them for the [[01:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6812.48s)]
*  president. When they recorded videos, much of the footage was still unusable. The man could not speak, [[01:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6817.04s)]
*  said one person involved. It wasn't his stutter. It was his inability to find words to remember [[01:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6822.4s)]
*  what he was saying, to stay on one train of thought. Aides would sometimes make videos in [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6826.72s)]
*  slow motion to blur the reality of how slowly he actually walked. We know that was a Steven Spielberg [[01:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6831.44s)]
*  recommendation. And just think of the irony that these guys are messing with videos in this way. [[01:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6838.16s)]
*  Being advised by the greatest filmmaker, probably of all time, certainly of modern America, [[01:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6845.04s)]
*  on exactly how to fool us. And then their media allies are running out there saying the real [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6850.96s)]
*  videos of Biden, a hot mess, are the cheap fakes. Those are the cheap fakes, not this shit they were [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6855.2s)]
*  putting out to us. Every shoot they write was anxiety inducing for Biden's team. Doing the videos [[01:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6860.5599999999995s)]
*  without the extra camera would have been impossible. At times, the president had such trouble communicating [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6868.48s)]
*  that the videos were unsalvageable and the team just opted not to release them. At other times, [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6873.28s)]
*  they released videos whose heavy editing was so obvious that they immediately regretted putting [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6878.719999999999s)]
*  them out. In April, 2024, the campaign held a staged town hall within a high school gym [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6883.12s)]
*  to film a campaign commercial. Biden took these prepared questions for about 90 minutes while the [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6890.96s)]
*  campaign cameras rolled. The campaign ultimately decided the footage was not usable. It was not [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6896.0s)]
*  usable. He had trouble pronouncing the names of world leaders. Staff began writing president slash [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6902.48s)]
*  prime minister of X country rather than writing out the names of the leaders. We saw all that. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6906.48s)]
*  They would try to avoid Q&A. If they had Q&A, they would pregame it so that they knew [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6914.959999999999s)]
*  exactly what was going to be asked. They talk about how he tripped on the sandbag and then [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6922.32s)]
*  they did the shorter walking paths and the short steps to Air Force One. We knew all that. [[01:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6925.759999999999s)]
*  They do talk about threats to press saying the Biden campaign and White House operatives [[01:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6929.36s)]
*  had a modus operandi for attacking any journalists who covered any questions about his age, [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6937.679999999999s)]
*  enlisting a core of social media influencers, progressive reporters, and Democrat operatives [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6942.799999999999s)]
*  to besmirch his unprofessional and biased those in the news media investigating this line of inquiry. [[01:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6947.599999999999s)]
*  They do talk about, as I mentioned, one female journalist who they made damn sure [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6953.44s)]
*  was not going to write this piece. That's a little bit later. Hold on. [[01:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6962.96s)]
*  The reporter reached out to a member of the White House press office to say she was going to report [[01:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6967.2s)]
*  that he was having serious and disturbing moments for getting names and facts, seemingly very [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6970.48s)]
*  seriously confused at meetings. Steve Ruchetti called her, disputed the reporting, [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6975.36s)]
*  and talked to her off the record so she couldn't use anybody said or even attribute it. But he told [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6981.28s)]
*  her everything the others were saying was false and that he was at the meetings as a counselor to [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6986.16s)]
*  the president. The message from the White House was clear. This reporter believed if she went [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6991.84s)]
*  forward with the story from anonymous aides, the White House would aggressively dispute it on the [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=6996.16s)]
*  record and portray her as a liar. The tacit threat worked. They talk about a Biden fundraiser in 2023. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7000.96s)]
*  He retold the same story within three minutes of telling it the first time. [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7009.92s)]
*  This was within his working hours, between 10 and 4. That was all true. That four to six hour work [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7018.8s)]
*  day, true. Shortly after 4 p.m. on a Wednesday, September 20th, 2023, for example, New York Times [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7025.4400000000005s)]
*  reporter Michael Shearer was among the small pool of White House reporters permitted to attend a Biden [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7031.6s)]
*  fundraiser at the Manhattan home of Carrie Fowler and Amy Goldman Fowler. Before a crowd of roughly [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7035.2s)]
*  two dozen donors, he stumbled through remarks reading from notecards. He referred to the J6 [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7041.76s)]
*  insurrection as happening on J8. January 8th. How do you not know J6 happened on J6? It was on January [[01:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7046.24s)]
*  8th, according to him, and had trouble making basic arguments. But the biggest shock came when he told [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7054.4s)]
*  his campaign origin story. He wasn't planning on running for president after the Obama administration, [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7058.639999999999s)]
*  but then came Charlottesville. He told the very fine people on both sides lie. He told the donors, [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7064.96s)]
*  and I mean this sincerely, that's when I decided I was going to run again. He talked about the [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7070.08s)]
*  Nazi signs. A young woman was killed. A young woman was killed. Next, Biden went through a story [[01:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7075.6s)]
*  about his family meeting to discuss whether he should run. And after describing some of the [[01:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7080.72s)]
*  conversation, he said, you know, you may remember that, you know, these folks from Charlottesville, [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7084.08s)]
*  as they came out of the fields and carrying those swastikas and the torches. And in addition to [[01:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7089.28s)]
*  that, there was white supremacists. Anyway, they were making the big case about how terrible this [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7094.72s)]
*  was. And a young woman was killed in the process. He then noted my predecessor and I, as I said, [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7098.4800000000005s)]
*  he said there are very fine people on both sides. The same exact story. The young woman, the fine [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7105.12s)]
*  people, the torches, the swastikas. Three minutes later. So I decided I would run. [[01:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7110.400000000001s)]
*  The room, Sheer noticed, was stone cold silent. Two days later, as the White House press [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7118.4800000000005s)]
*  secretary was asked about the president repeating the same story, mirror minutes apart, [[01:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7124.24s)]
*  Karine Jean-Pierre said, quote, the president was making very clear why he decided to run. [[01:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7127.2s)]
*  F this woman. She added that he was speaking from his heart and doing so in an incredibly passionate [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7132.5599999999995s)]
*  way. Villain. She knew. And she lied. A couple more. The wheelchair stories in here. We talked [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7139.44s)]
*  about that the other day. This guy, Dr. O'Connor, we believe he's the one who did all the physical [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7148.4s)]
*  and may or may not have done the PSA test. He had been consistent in his assertion that Biden's [[01:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7154.16s)]
*  gate had changed largely because of significant spinal arthritis in addition to mild post-fracture [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7160.16s)]
*  foot arthritis and a mild sensory periphery neuropathy of the foot or the feet. Biden's team [[01:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7166.08s)]
*  was offering new explanations that were more politically palatable. Multiple people close to [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7172.639999999999s)]
*  the White House explained he walked this way partly because of his refusal to wear an orthopedic boot [[01:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7177.04s)]
*  while suffering a hairline fracture in his foot before taking office. Lies. All lies. [[01:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7183.76s)]
*  There's a history of him lying about his health and there's no reason to believe his current stories. [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7191.04s)]
*  They get into the cognitive exams. Oh, they didn't think that they were necessary. [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7197.84s)]
*  Threatening. I talked about. [[02:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7203.12s)]
*  Stand by. What do you mean? No, I have it. [[02:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7207.92s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Congressman Mike Quigley, after the big State of the Union, oh, he's so strong. He's back. [[02:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7210.64s)]
*  Wow. Look at him go. They tell the story that Congressman Mike Quigley, who had not been this [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7220.320000000001s)]

*  president's voice was soft and breathy. His eyes were darting from side to side. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7238.88s)]
*  It again, disconcertingly reminded Quigley of his late father. [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7243.52s)]
*  There are a couple of memories like that with various people where being with Biden reminded [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7249.36s)]

*  And here's one more. Kamala Harris, after the debate, when the pressure was on for him to leave [[02:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7263.4400000000005s)]
*  and some of his loyalists backed him. The Democratic governors came to the White House. Remember that [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7269.68s)]
*  when they all went by plane, trains and automobiles. Their goal was to have a candid conversation with [[02:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7274.0s)]

*  We have to have the president's back, Harris said. It's our fucking democracy at stake. [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7287.360000000001s)]
*  That's what this is all about, you guys. This is all about a little thing called the TDS. [[02:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7296.72s)]
*  And once you get the TDS, it's very, very hard to get rid of the TDS and to interpret anything [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7305.6s)]
*  in your world without it being severely clouded by the TDS. This is about our fucking democracy. [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7312.72s)]
*  We will drag this infirm old man across the finish line if it kills us. And we will not talk [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7320.400000000001s)]

*  amongst his top team. I don't believe for one minute he just found out about it. I just don't. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7340.96s)]
*  The press, the aides, top Democrats, surrogates in the media, they all went along with the lie [[02:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7349.6s)]
*  because of the TDS. And only now are they coming to grips with what they did to their party, [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7358.32s)]
*  themselves, and the faith and trust that some people had at one point in the Democrat party. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7366.64s)]
*  This story's not going away. All of these people who are going to be running for president the next [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7373.6s)]
*  time around will be asked what they knew. And anyone from inside the administration [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7378.96s)]
*  is going to be held to account. I mean, Pete Buttigieg, he didn't know? Really? I can't wait [[02:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7385.84s)]
*  until he comes under questioning. Because you know what? CNN is likely to get a debate. [[02:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7392.48s)]
*  And I bet you we'll see Jake Tapper sitting there. And I wonder if he sees any of these [[02:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7396.4s)]
*  four cabinet secretaries who spoke to him, whether he will ask them about their role [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7401.44s)]
*  in the coverup. Won't that be an interesting moment? Thank you all for listening. More on this [[02:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7408.32s)]
*  ongoing story in the days ahead. We'll talk to you tomorrow. [[02:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y__aH6V2A2g&t=7416.08s)]
