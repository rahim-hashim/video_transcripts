Video Description: Megyn Kelly begins the show by breaking down the violent anti-ICE protests that erupted in Los Angeles over the weekend, the rioters' blatant disregard for human life, leftists claiming the riots are “mostly peaceful,” Donald Trump’s calling up the National Guard to restore order, Gov. Gavin Newsom’s inane response, and more. Then, Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, joins to discuss how Democrats and the media have reacted to the violence, how the left continues to paint Trump as an authoritarian, how far-left ideology is holding the Democratic Party hostage, ABC News suspending senior national correspondent Terry Moran for his late-night rant on X attacking Trump and deputy chief of staff Stephen Miller, how the media’s private biases are becoming increasingly public, why Moran likely won't be fired, Jason Bateman, Michelle Obama, and the Democrat Party continuing to insult Trump supporters, what the Dems don't understand about the right half of the country, George Clooney predicting the GOP will be in peril after Trump leaves office, a non-binary "best actor" winner at the Tony Awards, what Kirk thinks of the Trump vs. Elon Musk feud, and more.

# Dems Call Anti-ICE Riots “Peaceful,” and ABC Suspends Journalist for Trump Tweet, with Charlie Kirk
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 09, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. We begin today with breaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=0.0s)]
*  news out of Los Angeles, where the nation's second largest city has descended into chaos [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4.24s)]
*  with riots for the third straight night, causing massive destruction by lighting cars on fire, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=10.32s)]
*  destroying property and attacking law enforcement. All this ostensibly to voice opposition to recent [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=15.84s)]
*  arrests of people who have broken the law. Illegal immigrants who may just be illegals and may have [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=24.24s)]
*  committed other crimes. In most instances, what we're finding on these arrests is, well, some [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=32.8s)]
*  118 of them have committed the most heinous crimes one can commit in this country. So you'd think [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=37.68s)]
*  that the Angelinos the mayor keeps talking about would really like these people to be removed, [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=44.32s)]
*  but she and her governor appear to be on their side and not on the side of law enforcement. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=51.44s)]
*  Here are some of the scenes of the last three days. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=57.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=80.8s)]
*  It's total bedlam for the listening audience. It's total. There's some absolute asshole standing [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=99.2s)]
*  there throwing large rocks at full force at cars as they speed by. I mean, you literally could kill [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=105.76s)]
*  somebody doing that. And there are multiple instances of people behaving exactly this way. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=113.68s)]
*  In a depraved manner, you would be charged with murder if that person went off the road and had [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=119.52000000000001s)]
*  an accident and somebody died. It's absurd what they're allowing in Los Angeles. The Trump [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=126.4s)]
*  administration has ramped up immigration enforcement in the city. As I mentioned, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=133.68s)]
*  they've announced 118 arrests of illegals last week, including those, most of them, I believe, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=138.32s)]
*  with criminal histories in addition to breaking the immigration laws that include second degree [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=145.52s)]
*  murder, like murder. It's a problem. Drug trafficking. Of course, these guys always have [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=150.24s)]
*  crimes against children. They're big fans of exploiting, raping, molesting children as a rule. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=156.08s)]
*  If you're going to go collect some huge group of illegal immigrants here on Tom Homan's watch, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  the odds are you're going to find child sexual predators. Again, keep that in mind as we get to [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=169.04000000000002s)]
*  the Los Angeles mayor's reaction. The demonstrations began on Friday after ICE officers executed [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=174.88000000000002s)]
*  multiple search warrants at workplaces, including a clothing warehouse in the city's fashion district, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=182.56s)]
*  with protesters attempting to block the agents from doing their jobs. The same day, hundreds of [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=189.52s)]
*  protesters gathering around a federal building after rumors that authorities were holding [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=196.08s)]
*  detainees in the basement of that building. DHS officers fired pepper balls at the protesters [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=200.8s)]
*  before the LAPD dispersed the crowd. Acting ICE director Todd Lyons saying it looked or it took [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=207.60000000000002s)]
*  the LAPD two hours to respond. I mean, why? What's happening in city after city [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=213.36s)]
*  is they're letting the looters have their fun because they think it's better not to escalate. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=221.84s)]
*  It's the same thing as we've been seeing at CVSs since BLM. Remember there was that viral video of [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=227.12s)]
*  the CVS clerk actually trying to enforce the anti-shoplifting laws, meaning theft laws, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  and that person got blowback because the people who were looting or stealing from the CVS in that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=241.76s)]
*  case happened to be black. And now you have to get a CVS attendant to get deodorant out of the locked [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=246.64s)]
*  shelf because it's considered escalation if you involve the police when someone's breaking the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=254.56s)]
*  law. Only now it's spread to actual cops not doing their jobs because cops doing what cops [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=260.0s)]
*  are supposed to do is an escalation. All right. On Saturday, the situation got even worse. The [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=267.44s)]
*  protests spreading to nearby Paramount and Compton, California. We just talked about this video, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=274.8s)]
*  but we need to reshow it. Look at this. You see a man picking up heavy rocks and whipping them at [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=281.44s)]
*  drivers inside federal vehicles as they drive by. This is attempted murder. Look at this. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=286.96s)]
*  The depravity to human life is, I don't know, is it stunning? I don't know what it is. It's stomach [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=294.88000000000005s)]
*  turning. He did it over and over and over with some of the vehicles trying to swerve to get out of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=300.88000000000005s)]
*  the way. This isn't the presidential motorcade with the beast. They don't have bulletproof [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=305.76000000000005s)]
*  glass on the front of those trucks. These guys are there trying to keep these assholes safe. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=310.72s)]
*  In this video, a man riding a motorcycle. Look at this guy around a burning car. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=317.52000000000004s)]
*  While holding up the Mexican flag. Has there ever been a better picture of what we're up against? [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=325.44000000000005s)]
*  A lot of the protesters carried Mexican flags with them. Go home. You love Mexico so much. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=331.6s)]
*  Adios. Get out. Literally. What are you doing? Why are you here? Get out. What other country [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=338.48s)]
*  in the world would stand for this BS? You come here in most cases illegally. You set our things [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=346.16s)]
*  on fire. You threaten our law enforcement agents and then you want to parade around with your flag [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=353.44s)]
*  like that's the BLM. Then go home. Get out. Go make your living home in Mexico. We won't miss you. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=358.96000000000004s)]
*  They don't want you either, but that shouldn't be our problem. Get out. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=365.6s)]
*  I think Americans are sick of this. They're sick of this BS. Why do we have to live with these [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=370.0s)]
*  people? They don't assimilate. They don't like or respect our way of life. They feel entitled to be [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=375.36s)]
*  here to our public benefits, to healthcare. We're supposed to take care of them as they burn our [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=382.64s)]
*  cities and harass our cops waving your Mexican flag. Then get out. You love Mexico so much. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=390.32s)]
*  Go back to it. All this, not surprisingly, was enough for President Trump to take action and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=397.2s)]
*  thank God. Issuing a directive to send in 2000 members of the National Guard to protect ICE [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  agents and restore order. Why didn't you do that, Governor Newsom? Why didn't Karen Bass [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=411.12s)]
*  mobilize the LAPD to protect ICE agents and restore order? Secretary of Defense Pete [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=418.32s)]
*  Hegseth also putting the Marines at nearby Camp Pendleton on quote high alert if the violence [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=425.52s)]
*  continues, some 500 of them by latest reports. Rather than expressing thanks for the help, [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=430.48s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom called sending in the National Guard quote purposefully inflammatory [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=439.59999999999997s)]
*  and said that Secretary of Defense Hegseth's threat to send in the Marines was quote deranged [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=446.24s)]
*  behavior. But President Trump says this is about law and order. Watch. What is the bar for sending [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=451.76s)]
*  Marines to different cities? The bar is what I think it is. I mean, if we see danger to our country [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=459.44s)]
*  and to our citizens, we'll be very, very strong in terms of law and order. It's about law and order. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=463.84s)]
*  Governor Newsom has now formally requested that Mr. Trump pull out the National Guard troops. It's [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=472.15999999999997s)]
*  unbelievable here. He says he'll sue. He's going to sue if Trump doesn't because Newsom says this [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=477.84s)]
*  is not about immigration enforcement. It's about Trump's quote authoritarian tendencies. Here's [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  what he told MSNBC last night. Watch. All of this is about immigration enforcement and type of [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=491.04s)]
*  well, go ahead. I feel free to speak. I know. I don't even cut you off. I think it's about [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=500.16s)]
*  something much more. This is about authoritarian tendencies. This is about command and control. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=503.52000000000004s)]
*  This is about power. This is about ego. My way or the highway. This is a consistent pattern of practice [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=509.36s)]
*  of recklessness. This guy has abandoned the core principles of this great democracy. He's threatening [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=517.2800000000001s)]
*  to go after judges he disagrees with, cut off funding to institutions of higher learning. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=524.8000000000001s)]
*  He's on a cultural binge. He's rewriting history, censoring historical facts. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=532.48s)]
*  I mean, this is something completely different. And this is part of that ongoing play that is [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=538.5600000000001s)]
*  unfolding in front of our eyes. It is a serious moment under the guise of immigration, but it's [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=548.16s)]
*  much deeper than that. Of course, giving an interview to NBC's Jacob Soboroff, who also [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=553.36s)]
*  has spent the past eight years running cover for illegals. Very, very concerned about children of [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=559.2s)]
*  illegals being separated from their families under President Trump. Under President Biden [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=566.72s)]
*  did not appear to give two shits about it. I didn't see the lead NBC News report last week [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=570.72s)]
*  as we heard about the number of them who are now being found in the hands of these so-called [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  sponsors the Biden administration found for them who are molesting them. See, Jacob Soboroff, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=584.0s)]
*  in my opinion, only cares about the illegal children when it can hurt President Trump. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=589.6s)]
*  Then it's helpful to him. But if President Biden placed them in danger intentionally, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=595.12s)]
*  who would give them to sponsors who had not been vetted, who are single men, who are also illegals? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=600.4s)]
*  Does that sound like a good idea to anybody? NBC loses interest. President Trump has said officials [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=606.08s)]
*  will face charges if they get in the way of law and order. Governor Newsom, who landed last night [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=613.28s)]
*  in L.A. to manage the response to the riots. Nice to finally see you, sir. Great. It's been going on [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=618.72s)]
*  for days. Also had a message for border czar Tom Homan. Watch your hands off these poor people [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=624.8000000000001s)]
*  are just trying to get live their lives, man. Trying to live their lives, paying their taxes. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=632.64s)]
*  Been here 10 years. The fear, the horror, the hell is this guy? Come after me, arrest me. Let's just [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=636.96s)]
*  get it over with. Tough guy. You know, I don't give a damn. But I care about my community. I care [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=643.84s)]
*  about this community. The hell are they doing? These guys need to grow up. They need to stop. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=650.32s)]
*  And we need to push back. And I'm sorry to be so clear, but that kind of bloviating is exhausting. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=656.4s)]
*  So Tom, arrest me. Let's go. He's such an actor. I mean, that man doesn't have a sincere bone in [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=662.0s)]
*  his body. He's such an actor. The hell are they doing? I'm like, OK, tough guy. He's got like [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=671.12s)]
*  Matthew McConaughey vibes. And I don't mean that flatteringly. Kamala Harris. Because of course, [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=678.96s)]
*  everybody was wondering what does Kamala Harris think? I can't think of a subject on which I [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=686.0s)]
*  would actually ask myself that question. Maybe when somebody tried out a crappy Jamaican accent, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=693.04s)]
*  like I might be interested, when somebody used the phrase duality or unburdened by what has been, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=698.32s)]

*  She's an LA resident speaking out, saying the ICE arrests are, quote, part of the Trump [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=713.36s)]
*  administration's cruel, calculated agenda to spread panic and division. Division. Trump is the one [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=718.32s)]
*  responsible for division out there in LA. OK, he's trying to get rid of criminals so that your [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=726.72s)]

*  behaving criminally with impunity. She claimed the National Guard deployment, quote, [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=743.2s)]
*  is a dangerous escalation meant to provoke chaos. And she called the protests, of course, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=748.4s)]
*  this is the cherry on top of the sundae, overwhelmingly peaceful, overwhelmingly peaceful. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=753.68s)]
*  There is a line after like car after car after car that has been set on fire. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=761.12s)]
*  They are literally launching commercial grade fireworks at law enforcement. That's according [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=768.8s)]

*  Just watch this for the listening audience. You have around 2000 anti-ice rioters who took [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=805.92s)]
*  over the LA 101, the freeway, causing the road to be shut down for over an hour before police [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=813.36s)]
*  could disperse the crowd. Here's video of protesters throwing objects at California [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=819.12s)]

*  but you've got Harris and Newsom ripping on Trump. He's trying to sow chaos. This wasn't necessary. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=848.16s)]
*  We had it. We had it in hand. Your police chief says you're overwhelmed. He's overwhelmed. The [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=855.28s)]
*  cops there are overwhelmed. They're facing a lethal threat and getting no help. That video, [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=861.04s)]
*  by the way, was taken by Cam Higby, a local freelance reporter on the scene who's been [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=867.9200000000001s)]

*  BLM. You're not allowed to care if it's just a car or a building or a storefront that's actually [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=890.0s)]

*  widespread arson and widespread destruction? Understand this, California's had this pent-up [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1084.24s)]
*  problem for quite some time and only President Trump has the moral courage to go about and face [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1090.4s)]
*  it and to fix it. In California, one in four people in California were born outside of the United [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1095.6s)]
*  States. That doesn't mean they're all illegal. I'm just saying that one in four people in California [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1102.08s)]
*  were born outside of the United States, the highest of any in the country. And these are riots. They [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1106.48s)]
*  are not protests. We must be very clear with our language. When you start burning police vehicles [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1112.64s)]
*  and Waymo vehicles, when you start, as you aptly put, launching rocks and boulders at police [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1117.68s)]
*  officers in an attempt to get them killed, and the media's at it again, they're saying, well, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1124.88s)]
*  these are mostly peaceful protests as Los Angeles is under siege. And the final point on this that [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1128.5600000000002s)]
*  I want to make, which I think is very important, which a lot of Republicans currently do not have [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1135.92s)]
*  the stomach for mass deportations, I think that is changing, Megan. I think this display, even [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1142.16s)]
*  though it is egregious and it is infuriating and it is maddening, I think it's also motivating. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1147.92s)]
*  I think this is going to build consensus for Trump's big, beautiful bill. I think that this shows [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1153.76s)]
*  that we need more ICE officers, that we need to secure and strengthen our southern border, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1158.0s)]
*  that we cannot allow a foreign power to come onto our turf and basically taunt us. That's what we [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1162.8000000000002s)]
*  are seeing, Megan. We were seeing the taunting of invaders and foreign nationals who leech off of [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1169.68s)]
*  welfare and leech in our school system and flood our hospital system. And we have a big heart in [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1175.68s)]
*  this country and we should never stop having a big heart and helping those in need. What you saw there, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1181.2s)]
*  Megan, they're not in need. They're driving around with $30,000 motorcycles, lighting police officer [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1186.24s)]
*  vehicles on fire. These are not the downtrodden or the sojourner of South and Central America. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1192.96s)]
*  There's something much more sinister going on here and we're going to take back the country. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1198.48s)]
*  Praise God President Trump is at the helm to do just that. Yes, I look at this and I think [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1202.48s)]
*  all I want to hear from Karen Bass is thank you and I'm sorry. But instead, this is what we're [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1208.56s)]
*  hearing from the LA mayor who already has utterly failed her city as she sat there watching it burn [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1213.92s)]
*  from Africa. But now she says she senses a political opportunity to be opposed to Trump, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1220.64s)]
*  even though he's trying to keep people safe. And here's what she said in Sat 12. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1226.8s)]
*  We are going to fight for all Angelenos, regardless of when they got here, whether they [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1231.84s)]
*  have papers or not. We are a city of immigrants and this impacts hundreds of thousands of Angelenos. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1237.44s)]
*  We're going to fight for all Angelenos. How is- [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1247.2s)]
*  Whether they have papers. [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1249.68s)]
*  What's that? People are getting killed. Their children are getting molested. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1251.36s)]
*  No, it's just as if this is some sort of clerical error, Megan, whether they have papers or not. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1254.24s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, that's right. It's just some administrative error. We lost your form in the mail. [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1259.92s)]
*  No, no, no. They're illegal. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1265.68s)]
*  The DMV. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1266.88s)]
*  Yes, exactly. They're in violation of 8 U.S.C. 1312 in addition to many other federal laws. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1267.52s)]
*  But here's what I find most fascinating is that Karen Bass and Gavin Newsom, you could tell that [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1274.48s)]
*  they're being held hostage by a force. We don't quite know what this force is, but it is the power [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1281.04s)]
*  of intersectionality. If you look at some of these riots, yes, we have kind of the cartel, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1286.96s)]
*  the La Raza types. They want open borders. They want occupation. They want destruction. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1292.24s)]
*  But you've also started to see another type of force and political dynamic pop up in these [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1298.1599999999999s)]
*  protests, which is you are starting to see the Palestinian Gaza headwear start to pop open, [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1304.24s)]
*  right? As if that's what this is all about, right? Somehow this is about Gaza. They'll make it about [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1310.72s)]
*  Gaza. And then thirdly, you start to see the white liberal. All of a sudden, you're starting to see [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1314.16s)]
*  a bunch of white liberals show up because they know they need purpose in their life. They don't [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1318.48s)]
*  go to church. They're not getting married. They don't have kids. So they need something to keep [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1321.52s)]
*  them going. And boy, they're bringing the band back together after the summer of love in 2020. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1325.04s)]
*  So did someone say that we're burning a Wendy's tonight? Count me in. And all of a sudden, they [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1329.1200000000001s)]
*  start mobilizing. And that trifecta of a political force obviously is bigger than we have realized [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1332.96s)]
*  because any leader who cares about their people would stand up to this group of bandits and this [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1339.3600000000001s)]
*  mob that is engulfing Los Angeles yet again. Gavin Newsom and Karen Bass, they feel as if they have [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1347.68s)]
*  an obligation to the lawless. They have an obligation to this insurgency. And it is very [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1354.8s)]
*  revealing that the base of the Democrat Party, not some sort of fringe element, but the base, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1361.84s)]
*  the fundamental ingredient of the Democrat Party is street violence. I wish it wasn't that case, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1367.4399999999998s)]
*  Megan, because she should be saying, we want LAPD. We're going to go after these riots. Thank you [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  for sending in the National Guard. Instead, she's acting like it's a paperwork error. Gavin Newsom is [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1378.8799999999999s)]
*  suing President Trump. Again, he should be saying, thank you, President Trump, for sending the marines [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1383.76s)]
*  and sending the federal government. Instead, we are seeing two high-profile political leaders [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1388.16s)]
*  pander to the most sinister and dark elements of the Democrat Party. I want to make sure I get this [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1394.3200000000002s)]
*  in so I don't forget it. Under no circumstances, I'm calling the shot right now, should Los Angeles [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1398.24s)]
*  be allowed to host the 2028 Olympics? Period. Hard stop. We should pull it. It should go to some other [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1403.28s)]
*  American city, go to Dallas, go to Miami, go anywhere but LA. But if you cannot put out fires [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1409.28s)]
*  while you intentionally ignore them and you elevate DEI fire practices over the well-being [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1415.52s)]
*  of your citizens, and if you basically cheer on the incineration of your city, that is a mockery. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1421.76s)]
*  It should not be put on the world's display under any circumstances whatsoever. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1427.76s)]
*  Yes. We're looking at a very powerful set of pictures here of Los Angeles burning [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1432.16s)]
*  and the Mexican flag everywhere. It's really crazy how emboldened they are to fly their Mexican flag. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1439.12s)]
*  What are they doing here? Why are they here? Because they want to take advantage of our [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1444.08s)]
*  dollars, our economy, and our health care and other public benefits that they get, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1449.28s)]
*  that we're giving them. So it's like they're on the public dole, most of them, and we're fine [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1457.4399999999998s)]
*  with that apparently, or at least Californians seem to be, but they hate us. They actually miss [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1462.24s)]
*  Mexico. We'll go home. It's like two hours by car at most. You're good. It's so easy for you to go [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1467.52s)]
*  back home to the people you seem to love so much. Here's another sample, just because I love the [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1472.72s)]
*  sound that shows you how people are feeling. This is California representative Norma Torres, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1479.44s)]
*  who, it's quick, but she's got thoughts on ICE coming in to try to clean up her city, South 11. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1485.28s)]
*  ICE get the fuck out of the highway so that order can't be stored. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1492.48s)]
*  Okay. Get the F out. Right? Elected representatives of the people. Right? This is how all the left is [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1496.16s)]
*  going to paint this, from Karen Bass to Gavin Newsom to this nutcase Norma Torres and beyond, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1506.5600000000002s)]
*  because we're already seeing federal officials like senators weigh in on this, as it's President [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1512.0800000000002s)]
*  Trump who's over the top with his knee-jerk authoritarian response. The New York Times today [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1517.3600000000001s)]
*  with a similar sort of take, hold on. I want to find it. They wrote as follows. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1525.7600000000002s)]
*  Trump invoked this rarely used provision of the US code. No one can argue it's not legal because [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1532.3200000000002s)]
*  it's very clearly legal what he's doing. They say he can do it if there's a rebellion against the [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1536.16s)]
*  authority of the government of the United States, which is the federal government, which is what [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1540.8000000000002s)]
*  Trump's saying we're seeing here. No such rebellions underway, says the Times. As the governor's [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1544.64s)]
*  spokesman and others have noted, Americans in cities routinely cause more property damage [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1549.44s)]
*  after their sports teams win or lose. Trump's idea of law and order is strong-handed, [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1554.16s)]
*  disproportionate intervention that adds chaos, anxiety, and risk to already tense situations. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1559.0400000000002s)]
*  That's going to be the left-wing line on it. We've heard a couple of people make that point about, [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1565.68s)]
*  looks like an Eagles game, the aftermath of an Eagles game. My husband's an Eagles fan. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1570.88s)]
*  We always laugh at the, and also roll our eyes, at the over the top behavior after the Eagles games. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1576.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't remember anyone trying to kill police officers and law enforcement as they just drove [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1583.36s)]
*  their cars by, like car after car, throwing dangerous materials over the overpass at them [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1589.36s)]
*  directly with full force as they pass, or commercial grade fireworks at their bodies. I don't recall that. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1595.4399999999998s)]
*  No, not at all. Of course, they're trying to minimize it. It's that old [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1604.56s)]
*  celebration parallax that Michael Anton instructed us, who's phenomenal. It's not happening, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1610.32s)]
*  but it's good that it is. It's not happening that they're burning down the city, but it's good that [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1616.72s)]
*  it is because it's about time that someone fights back against Trump. You're like, wait a second, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1621.28s)]
*  I thought you just said it wasn't happening. They're going to try to make the spread to cities across, [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1625.12s)]
*  no, exactly. They're going to try to make the spread to cities across the country. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1629.76s)]
*  This is a reaction to a couple things. Of course, the beginning of mass deportations, and you better [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1633.6799999999998s)]
*  believe we're only going to ratchet up more. We're going to go into more neighborhoods. We're going [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1638.88s)]
*  to find more criminal gang bangers. We're going to find more cartel members because it looks like [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1642.72s)]
*  we're barely touching the surface. Based on what we saw yesterday, we are barely touching the surface. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1647.1200000000001s)]
*  But number two, and I think this is very important, Claudia Steinbaum, the president of Mexico. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1652.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. She said the big, beautiful bill means massive widespread response that we're [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1660.0800000000002s)]
*  going to activate in America. Interesting. It's funny that a president of a foreign nation is [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1667.36s)]
*  able to activate sleeper cells in our country because in the big, beautiful bill is a tax on [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1672.6399999999999s)]
*  remittances. Understand that remittances are tens of billions of dollars a year, which is people that [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1678.7199999999998s)]
*  come to the United States illegally. They'll work and steal jobs from native-born Americans, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1684.4799999999998s)]
*  send back money from America to Mexico, basically in a parasitic-type relationship. We're going to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1689.6s)]
*  extract money from America and send it to Mexico. They know that this is a major part of the Mexican [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1695.92s)]
*  economy. Finally, the big, beautiful bill is going to tax that. Sorry, if you're here illegally and [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1702.96s)]
*  you're going to send money back to Mexico, we're not going to put up with that. But look, why are [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1709.28s)]
*  they here, Megan? Why is it that they're waving the Mexican flag? It's not because they love America. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1713.92s)]
*  They care about our values. They don't believe in e pluribus unum or liberty. They don't know Thomas [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1719.1200000000001s)]
*  Jefferson from George Washington. They're here for one reason, because we're rich. That's it. [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1723.84s)]
*  It's because we're rich and we're suckers. That's it. We have a wealthy nation that was, and we are [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1728.9599999999998s)]
*  suckers that just keep on writing checks. And again, we're a generous nation. We're a Christian [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1735.6s)]
*  nation. We should continue to be those things. But nowhere does it say in the scriptures, [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1741.04s)]
*  should you allow yourself to be repeatedly taken advantage of while you are mocked and while they [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1745.6799999999998s)]
*  are taunting you for taking money from you and taking treasure while your own people are suffering [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1751.84s)]
*  in great measure and great number. And so this really is a early moment with very powerful [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1758.08s)]
*  aesthetics and visuals and optics that shows the two camps in this country. One wants law order [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1763.9199999999998s)]
*  and a prioritization of American citizens first. The other is an open border criminal first type [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1770.72s)]
*  agenda that prioritizes arson and the disorder deconstruction of the United States of America. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1776.96s)]
*  And you finally have a president who's going to fight back against this. Trump is saying [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1784.32s)]
*  this is not going to happen. We're not letting this go. Like this is not going to be another BLM [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1788.08s)]
*  2020 situation. We are going to make sure that we take a handle on these things. And you're not [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1792.56s)]
*  going to be permitted to come into this country and cause damage to our law enforcement, cause [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1797.92s)]
*  damage to our property and get away with it. Here. You've said twice now that this is going to [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1802.24s)]
*  spread and that's what the Democrats want. And we actually have proof of that. Here's Democratic [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1806.72s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy yesterday from, or maybe it's today, it's today on Morning Joe this morning. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1812.96s)]
*  Take a listen. I saw this. Yeah. My first message is to keep it peaceful. I mean, obviously this is [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1821.3600000000001s)]
*  a moment where we have to be on the streets all over the country to protest what's happening to [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1825.6000000000001s)]
*  our immigrant community, but more broadly to protest what's happening to our democracy. This [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1831.04s)]
*  is the most corrupt administration in the history of the country. And we are going to rise to this [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1834.72s)]
*  moment by being out there on the streets. There's nothing in what he is doing that is about peace [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1840.56s)]
*  or about restoring order. And he's trying to turn a protest that is pretty small into something that [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1845.76s)]
*  involves an even bigger confrontation so that he might actually be able to invoke the insurrection [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1851.3600000000001s)]
*  act. So he wants more. They get away. They say, well, we want it to be peaceful, but he knows very [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1856.16s)]
*  well how it will go if we get more. Yeah, of course. And that's why I fully support President [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1862.08s)]
*  Trump meeting it at the intensity that it's had. I think we should be unafraid to sign the 1807 [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1868.0s)]
*  Insurrection Act. If this continues, we cannot allow what happened in 2020 where we said, well, [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1873.4399999999998s)]
*  you know, local state officials, nope, not going to happen. We are going to meet force with force. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1878.32s)]
*  You're going after police officers. We'll bring in the National Guard. We'll bring in the Marines. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1882.6399999999999s)]
*  If you remember the 1992, May of 1992, Rodney King riots, they were engulfing Los Angeles, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1886.32s)]
*  HW Bush signs, the Insurrection Act within like half an hour, all of those thugs and all of those [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1891.84s)]
*  bandits went home and scattered because they were met with the one thing they understand. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1898.8s)]
*  The only thing that what you are seeing on the streets right now, they understand it's not reason, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1904.0s)]
*  it's not persuasion, it's not acquiescence, it's not surrender. It is force. That's it. They need [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1908.8s)]
*  to see a stronger hand than they have. And unfortunately, there is an underbelly of America [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1914.32s)]
*  that wants to see the world burn. Like Joker said in the Dark Knight, some people just want to watch [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1921.76s)]
*  the world burn. That is the Democrat Party. They've never had gratitude for America. They've [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1927.6799999999998s)]
*  never loved our history. They've never loved our culture, our institutions. I'm not saying every [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1932.6399999999999s)]
*  Democrat in the country believes this. I'm not even saying every Democrat politician does. I am [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1937.4399999999998s)]
*  saying this though, that ideology is holding the entire Democrat Party hostage. As you can see, [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1941.6s)]
*  it is dominant. And in LA, one of the greatest cities in America is a captured and a fallen place. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1946.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm confident that we can liberate it because I actually believe deep down, the vast majority of [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1954.08s)]
*  America is so on board with what President Trump is doing. This is one of the reasons why he won a [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1958.48s)]
*  popular vote majority. This is why he won an electoral vote landslide. One of the major [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1962.7199999999998s)]
*  fundamental reasons is that President Trump was standing up against these elements of darkness. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1966.88s)]
*  People want deportations. They want these criminals and these thugs out of the country. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1973.0400000000002s)]
*  And again, if all the people that we were deporting were just, you know, nuns at the local Catholic [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1977.44s)]
*  church, then we wouldn't be seeing what we're seeing in the streets. Instead, it shows that [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1983.2800000000002s)]
*  there's a widespread, well-connected and fierce network of criminals that we must remove from [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1987.6000000000001s)]
*  this country. The nerve of Gavin Newsom to try to say, as he did yesterday in an ex post, [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=1992.72s)]
*  that Trump is hoping for chaos and is trying to manufacture a crisis. There's absolutely no [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2000.48s)]
*  reason for Trump to manufacture a crisis. Trump's approval ratings are higher than they've ever been. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2006.32s)]
*  They are higher at this point in his presidency than Obama had, than George W. Bush had, than [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2011.76s)]
*  then Biden had. So what incentive does Trump have to manufacture a crisis? Things are actually [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2017.1200000000001s)]
*  going quite well for Donald Trump right now. He's just trying to help the city of Los Angeles [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2026.16s)]
*  and the people out there and also to send a message to other potential rioters in other cities. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2032.32s)]
*  Don't start. Don't even think about it. I'll kill it in its crib. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2037.68s)]
*  Totally. Let's play this out. So if he was who they say he was, wouldn't he just let LA burn? [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2041.76s)]
*  They didn't vote for him. None of these people like him, apparently, right? Just let it burn. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2049.12s)]
*  Who cares about LA? No, but he's actually a president for all Americans. It's not just about [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2054.08s)]
*  seeking revenge and prioritizing your friends. No, LA is one of the bluest cities in the country. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2058.8s)]
*  Just for the audience, we're looking at a picture of National Guard troops getting ready at a [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2065.36s)]
*  staging area in front of a building that has had death to America spelled A-M-E-R-I-K-K-A. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2070.4s)]
*  Of course. They're so dumb. They don't even realize that there's supposed to be three Ks in [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2076.96s)]
*  the KKK. I'm going to do it. Please do it right without spelling errors. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2080.56s)]
*  Anyway, that's what we're up against. Sorry, Charlie, for the interruption. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2085.2000000000003s)]
*  No, no, no. It's very astute you point that out because, again, this goes back to one of my life [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2088.88s)]
*  themes, which is I see that and I hear that on college campuses all the time. That varies while [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2094.0s)]
*  they usually add the K, but that's a separate issue. Meaning what happens on college campuses [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2099.6s)]
*  will soon happen in the halls of Congress and in the streets. This is all an outgrowth of ideology [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2104.56s)]
*  that is formed and festered, tried and incubated on college campuses. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2109.36s)]
*  Now, what is the core contention? Understand the core contention of what's animating them [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2113.12s)]
*  is they think California is theirs. La Raza is a group that has been around in America [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2117.36s)]
*  for quite some time. They believe La Raza is an insurgency Mexican group that thinks that [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2122.0s)]
*  California is still Mexico's. Yeah, as if Mexico would do a great job with California. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2126.96s)]
*  Mexico is a big country. Do you guys have anything close to California as far as the wealth and the [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2130.48s)]
*  prestige? No, there's something different between the United States and Mexico, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2134.64s)]
*  and we should appreciate that. That's why there's a lot more Mexicans that try to get into California [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2138.32s)]
*  than Californians that try to get into Mexico. And I'm not even necessarily even against [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2143.52s)]
*  Mexicans as people. You and I both know wonderful people that are from Mexico. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2147.6s)]
*  The point is this, is that there is a parasitic ideology, and I want to try to educate the [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2151.44s)]
*  audience quickly on this, because in 2020 we had to try to learn about critical race theory. Remember? [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2156.16s)]
*  We went deep and we learned about CRT and BLM and postmodernism, poststructuralism, and we learned [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2160.96s)]
*  about Robin D'Angelo and we read about Derek Bell and Kimberley Crenshaw. I want to open your [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2166.08s)]
*  audience's eyes to another type of idea toxin. It's similar to CRT, but it's different. It is [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2170.64s)]
*  the open border ideology. It's closer to critical legal theory. It is that the world should have no [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2177.68s)]
*  borders. It is anti-colonialist at its core. Anti-colonialism is the base of the modern [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2182.8s)]
*  Democrat party, that there is no such thing as America. How many times have we heard that, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2189.2000000000003s)]
*  which is we're living on conquered and stolen land? When you guys hear land acknowledgments, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2194.0800000000004s)]
*  remember that whole kind of goofy thing you've heard for years, Megan, where I want to acknowledge [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2199.28s)]
*  that we're on the Uriquoy land or the Navajo? That's where this leads, which is that California [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2203.2000000000003s)]
*  is not America. Who are you to say that we're here illegally? No person is illegal. You're here on [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2209.6s)]
*  stolen land and you allow these idea toxins to manifest and to then grow with momentum. Unchallenged, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2213.2s)]
*  you are then met with a huge portion of the Los Angeles population that doesn't believe in America, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2221.44s)]
*  but they'll certainly take money from the U.S. government. They don't believe in our country, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2228.0s)]
*  don't believe in our creed, and they are occupants on a land that they detest because they think [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2231.84s)]
*  that this place is actually theirs. I believe that we're going to see in the next coming months [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2237.9199999999996s)]
*  and maybe years a resurgence the same way that we saw CRT and wokeism spread throughout our institutions. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2244.3999999999996s)]
*  They're going to attempt to do the same with anti-colonialism throughout so many of the power [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2252.24s)]
*  centers in our country. Very poorly timed, very poorly timed because the American people are [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2256.72s)]
*  overwhelmingly in favor of what Trump's doing on the deportations, not just at the border, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2260.0s)]
*  but on the actual deportations. But what do you make of my theory that this is what's happening? [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2264.24s)]
*  Why did the LAPD sit around for two hours letting this happen? I think it's the CVS theory that I [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2269.04s)]
*  was telling the audience about at the top where we actually pulled the video. Do you remember this [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2274.16s)]
*  moment? It happened in 2020 in the BLM riots and it was just one of a million incidents that we've [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2278.8799999999997s)]
*  covered where law enforcement was going to be brought in, but the person thinking about bringing [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2284.64s)]
*  them in to stop crime was shamed about doing it as like if you call a cop, you're anti-black. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2289.68s)]
*  You're an anti-black racist. And I do, I firmly believe this is why we've seen in so many pockets, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2296.3199999999997s)]
*  the erosion of law enforcement, the unwillingness to call them now, because you get shamed [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2302.24s)]
*  out of calling law enforcement if you're a civilian or being law enforcement and doing your job. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2306.96s)]
*  If you're a cop, here was the moment in Washington, DC in 2020. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2312.08s)]
*  You decided to call the police on two black people that stole, that allegedly took something from the [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2317.12s)]
*  store because you're willing to uphold the policy and they could have lost their lives. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2322.3199999999997s)]
*  I followed my company's policies, not your policies, where I can appreciate your concerns. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2328.56s)]
*  So you're willing to risk someone's life for what, $30,000 a year? That's... [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2332.24s)]
*  There was no risk in my opinion. Thank you. You have a great night. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2336.3999999999996s)]
*  What is your name? My name is Storm Manager. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2340.96s)]
*  No, what is his name? No one's going to tell you my name when you're sitting here video taking [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2343.92s)]
*  us so that you can try and elicit some sort of violence against me. It's not going to happen. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2348.08s)]
*  Elicit violence against you? You just elicited violence against two black men by calling the [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2351.76s)]
*  police on them. We got to walk away when one of them had a warrant and could have been arrested [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2356.0s)]
*  and the cops still let him go. Just listen to yourself. You work with black folks. You just [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2359.36s)]
*  remember that. Oh, blood boiling. But that's what I believe. This is why the LAPD sat there for two [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2362.96s)]
*  hours not doing anything. Totally. I want you to remember back in 2020, there was this book [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2371.28s)]
*  written by someone Hertzweil at NPR wrote, The Case for Looting. The Western norms that you and [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2379.1200000000003s)]
*  I share, Megan, are not necessary... They're trying to deconstruct all of it. That is what [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2386.6400000000003s)]
*  the Democrat Party stands for, is that they don't believe in private property. They also... It is... [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2391.28s)]
*  LAPD, I don't know, was it a stand down order given by Karen Bass? We should look into all that. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2396.88s)]
*  I would like to think the rank and file actually are really embarrassed by what's happening and [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2402.08s)]
*  they want... Definitely. I would like to think that they're just maddened and angry at this. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2406.72s)]
*  Again, I could tell you that this dog would not hunt in many cities across the country, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2412.32s)]
*  in Dallas or in Houston. Oh, yeah. Try this. Why don't we try this in Lubbock, Texas and see how [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2418.16s)]
*  Miami... Yeah, exactly. Or I think in Florida, they wouldn't put up with this nonsense, right? [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2424.32s)]
*  Not coming to Tampa near you. Totally. Yeah, that's right. And so, a tied and true rule [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2428.88s)]
*  is if you... What you put up with is what you get. What you put up with is what you get. [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2438.24s)]
*  Exactly. And so, with the rank and file of these criminal gangs, which by the way, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2445.04s)]
*  let's just talk about for a second. These are operating kind of like gangs, honestly, right? [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2451.92s)]
*  I mean, these are not the best that Los Angeles has to offer. You shut down a highway and you [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2456.56s)]
*  start lobbing granite stones at police officers. And so, the lack of repudiation from the major [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2462.88s)]
*  networks and from the media, it's as if they want another summer where the country goes up in flames. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2472.96s)]
*  I would like to believe though, as horrible as this is, this will only make President Trump's [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2479.28s)]
*  approval rating go up. I'm sad to say that because I don't want to see my country burn. I don't like [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2483.28s)]
*  saying that Los Angeles is some sort of occupied city, but it is. And as you can see the footage [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2488.32s)]
*  on screen right now, do these people look like the best that we're... Does this look like the [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2493.28s)]
*  people we want? Is that guy assimilating as he's punching right into the car? No, of course not. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2498.48s)]
*  And if you import the third world, you get the third world. You see this in third worlds all the [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2504.16s)]
*  time. Massive mobs get what they want. They burn the nice stuff. It takes no talent whatsoever [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2510.56s)]
*  to go burn, to go destroy. My two-year-old is really good at destroying. It takes a lot of talent. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2516.56s)]
*  In fact, it is unique in human history to build, to have wealth, to be rich. And America has done [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2522.08s)]
*  that. And it's confounded the world. And now the third world wants to come here. And the only thing [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2528.08s)]
*  we ask when you come here is be grateful and assimilate. And apparently that's too much to [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2532.72s)]
*  ask. Instead, they are leeching off of our country and they are filled with ingratitude and venom. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2537.4399999999996s)]
*  And as you can see, with widespread chaos in our streets and we should not put up with it. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2543.7599999999998s)]
*  And disregard for human life. No normal person would ever throw cinder blocks or rocks off an [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2548.56s)]
*  overpass at the cars below. That's who we're importing. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2555.9199999999996s)]
*  That's sick. I mean, that's true. And frankly, I really don't care whether they're illegal or [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2559.2799999999997s)]
*  they're American. I really don't care. You need law enforcement to come and protect the ICE agents [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2563.2799999999997s)]
*  who are there doing their job. That is depraved indifference to life. Here's Maxine Waters, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2568.7999999999997s)]
*  always to be counted on for an absurd take representing her party, the Democrats, [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2573.52s)]
*  reacting to it all and the National Guard coming into town. 16. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2579.52s)]
*  I don't know why we have guns. What are those guns for? Are they to shoot protesters? I mean, [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2584.08s)]
*  there's no reason to be here with the National Guard. The president of the United States is [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2590.6400000000003s)]
*  cruel. This honorable human being who would just assume they shoot somebody down. But I [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2596.2400000000002s)]
*  don't want that to happen. Okay. It's not just her, by the way. Okay. There was another one, [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2601.6800000000003s)]
*  an LA city council member, Eunice Hernandez, who went even further than Maxine. Take a listen to [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2610.88s)]
*  this person in SOP 15. They know how quickly we mobilize. That's why they're changing tactics, [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2618.1600000000003s)]
*  because community defense works and our resistance has slowed them down before. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2624.48s)]
*  And if they're escalating their tactics, then so are we. When they show up, [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2628.1600000000003s)]
*  we got to show up even stronger. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2633.52s)]
*  And there are signs behind her that read no deportation. So you can't deport anybody. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2639.7599999999998s)]
*  And when ICE steps up its tactics, this little lady, I think, Eunice Hernandez, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2648.64s)]
*  is going to step up her tactics against ICE. And then they wonder, Maxine Waters wonders, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2654.8799999999997s)]
*  what the National Guard is doing here. I don't know why they're here with their guns. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2660.88s)]
*  You should talk to Eunice, Maxine. You girls should have a chat. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2664.6400000000003s)]
*  Yes. And again, the reason that they have guns is the only thing these people understand is more [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2670.88s)]
*  force, is a bigger weapon. That's all they understand. There's no reasoning with them. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2675.76s)]
*  By the way, we're not going to give them anything that they want. We're not going to stop the [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2680.6400000000003s)]
*  deportations. There'll only be even more after this. We need to get to four to five to six [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2683.84s)]
*  thousand a day. And understand this is that the LA field office was really lagging in deportations [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2688.8s)]
*  for a couple months. Very obvious that the deportation officers there didn't really know [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2694.8s)]
*  what they were doing because they didn't have to do this for the last couple months. And it's been [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2698.8s)]
*  publicly reported that Stephen Miller basically started screaming at the ICE guys being like, [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2702.0800000000004s)]
*  where are your numbers? Get them up. And this is really prompted by the guys getting into the field. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2706.96s)]
*  And all of a sudden you're like, you can't touch our people. Actually, we can and we will. And [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2711.6800000000003s)]
*  you're going back to Mexico since you love it so much. And in fact, we'll buy you a plane ticket. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2715.04s)]
*  You can go back. And since the border is secure, you're not going to be able to come back in. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2718.7200000000003s)]
*  And that's also what they understand is that in a prior administration, okay, you get deported, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2722.16s)]
*  you just come right back. Right? Remember how many times we heard Megan always been six times [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2726.32s)]
*  deported, seven times deported. You just kind of come on back. It's a little bit of a logistical [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2729.28s)]
*  inconvenience. Now the border is completely secure. It is totally secure. So there's no, [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2733.28s)]
*  there's no more coming back in. And then the question is how many illegals are actually in [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2739.12s)]
*  this country? Is it 20, 25 million, 30 million? Is it 10% of our country? Nobody knows and nobody [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2742.96s)]
*  actually even cares to try to find out. And there you have elected leaders that are citing, who is [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2750.32s)]
*  their constituency? Their constituency are not Americans. And then you failed to be a nation [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2756.8s)]
*  when your constituency is foreigners. Why are her signs in Spanish, no deportación? I think we get [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2763.44s)]
*  to decide that not unisys. You don't get to decide that. Sorry. We had a whole election [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2770.32s)]
*  where the entire country voted that we don't want illegals in this country. You lost, you lost. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2774.96s)]
*  Here is Maxine Waters was causing all sorts of antics yesterday because she loves to see her [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2780.7200000000003s)]
*  face on camera. But there was the SEIU president, the union president, this guy David Huerta out [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2785.92s)]
*  there who thought it would be a great idea to try to obstruct allegedly the access of these federal [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2792.32s)]
*  agents at a work site. They're going place to place. Tom Homan and his guys are going place [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2800.16s)]
*  to place to try to find illegals and get them out of here. And this guy, David Huerta, is accused of [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2804.88s)]
*  SEIU president trying to interfere with that at a work site, according to the US attorney for the [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2809.84s)]
*  central district of California. And he got arrested. So they arrested the SEIU president out there for [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2815.92s)]
*  interfering in this behavior. And then Maxine tried to inject herself into the scenario by [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2822.72s)]
*  going to the facility, the federal facility where he's being held and trying to force her way in, [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2828.72s)]
*  in the midst of all this chaos. Okay. Like all the law enforcement, including those managing this [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2835.2799999999997s)]
*  facility have enough to deal with, right? With actual criminals who are getting arrested, [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2839.2s)]
*  trying to hurt law enforcement agents, you know, throwing the bricks, all this stuff, [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2843.4399999999996s)]
*  lighting cars on fire. And she decides now would be a great opportunity for a photo op photo op for [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2846.72s)]
*  her to go to this facility and try to check on David. She wants to check on him. And she got [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2851.68s)]
*  exactly the treatment she should get. And everyone like her should get who tries to interfere [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2856.88s)]
*  in the midst of a crisis with what our cops are doing. Here's what happened. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2862.56s)]
*  She tried to stick her hand in the door as they closed it. And to their credit, they closed it [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2866.0s)]
*  anyway. She had to pull her hand out. And then she gave an interview after the fact, playing the [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2890.16s)]
*  victim, Charlie. And it's just the theatrics is just so tired and just dumb. Right. And this is [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2893.68s)]
*  the state of the Democrat party. I mean, wait, can I ask you, I'm sorry to interrupt you. I asked you, [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2902.48s)]
*  but like you said theatrics, how about Gavin Newsom? The hell? Oh, the hell is it? Like who's a [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2906.3999999999996s)]
*  better actor? I'm not sure. They're both up for an award. I was watching him on MSNBC. He's got a new [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2914.48s)]
*  hand motion. I was going to text him. It's this. It's got like, you know, usually it's kind of this. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2920.0s)]
*  And then he's doing this. He was doing this thing on MSNBC. He's doing this whole thing. Look, he [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2925.6s)]
*  is the fakest person I think I've ever met in my entire life. So synthetic. And honestly, that's [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2931.28s)]
*  very dangerous, like incredibly dangerous. Like he's the type of person that could just like stare [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2936.48s)]
*  you like, oh yeah, I voted for Trump and just like pass a lie detector test. That is very, very [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2942.0s)]
*  dangerous, you know, just stone cold, just like no inhibitions whatsoever when it comes to deceit or [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2947.04s)]
*  lying or misleading. But again, Gavin wants to be president. So this is him trying to recover from, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2955.04s)]
*  you know, the damage that he got after the podcast I had with him. Remember I asked him, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2960.88s)]
*  what are you going to do about transports? He did nothing and all that. And he got a huge left flank. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2964.56s)]
*  So how do you, this is very instructive. How do you get yourself back into the Democrat primary [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2967.52s)]
*  circle? How do you win back support? You let your city burn. Nothing gets you back into the [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2972.72s)]
*  good wishes of the Democrat party. Nothing makes you a popular Democrat than the smell of ashes and [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2978.48s)]
*  burning, the burning city. In fact, remember Gwen Waltz who said, I rolled down my window after [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2986.8799999999997s)]
*  Minneapolis was burning and the smell of tires was invigorating because it smelled like Justin. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2993.2799999999997s)]
*  People were joking that Gwen Waltz is booking a plane ticket to LA right now. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=2998.64s)]
*  Loves the smell of napalm in the morning, but this time it's the smell of [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3005.92s)]
*  ribbing in the morning. Stand by quick ad. Charlie stays with us for the full show. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3009.2799999999997s)]
*  And there's so much more to get to. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3013.3599999999997s)]
*  This administration is working very hard to try and fix this country. But while they're focused [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3017.7599999999998s)]
*  on fixing the country, they can't fix your personal finances. That's really up to you. [[00:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3023.36s)]
*  And that's why thousands of Americans are turning to birch gold. In the past 12 months, the value of [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3029.1200000000003s)]
*  gold has risen by 30%. Think about that. How's your stock market investment doing? Has it gone up 30%? [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3034.2400000000002s)]
*  Have you made 30% on your money? And demand is strong and it's growing. While reports are that [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3043.1200000000003s)]
*  the BRICS nations are actively working to challenge the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3049.44s)]
*  currency. That's not great. In other uncertain times, gold has offered peace of mind. And in [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3054.2400000000002s)]
*  these uncertain times, it does the same. Birch gold makes it incredibly easy to convert your [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3060.48s)]
*  existing IRA or 401k into a tax sheltered IRA backed by physical gold. Or if you prefer, [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3065.84s)]

*  and in particular, Stephen Miller, who is the architect of the very popular policy when it [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3164.0s)]
*  comes to illegals, is ABC News' Terry Moran, their senior national correspondent. This guy's [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3170.3199999999997s)]
*  been with ABC since 1997. He was the chief White House correspondent under W, under Clinton as [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3177.28s)]
*  well. He was co-anchor of Nightline from 05 to 13. He was ABC News' chief foreign correspondent [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3183.44s)]
*  from 13 to 18. And he's been senior national correspondent for the past almost, well, seven, [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3189.76s)]
*  eight years now. He also leads the network's Supreme Court coverage. This guy is as rabidly [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3197.2000000000003s)]
*  partisan as they come. He fits in perfectly at ABC News, perfectly. And in a moment that was [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3205.04s)]
*  kind of stunning, but the sentiment not surprising from him, he got on X at 12.06 a.m. Sunday, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3214.08s)]
*  meaning six after midnight, Saturday night. Guarantee you the guy. A little bit of a drunk. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3224.08s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, what else would make him take the mask down, like the veils down? The sentiments [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3229.2s)]
*  are as they always have been. But the veil came down and he decided to post the following on X. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3234.56s)]
*  The thing about, like just out of the blue, or maybe it's because of the LA riots, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3240.32s)]
*  the thing about Stephen Miller is not that he's the brains behind Trumpism. Yes, he is one of the [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3244.16s)]
*  people who conceptualizes the impulses of the Trumpist movement and translates them into policy. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3249.04s)]
*  But that's not what's interesting about Miller. So far, we're okay. So far, he hasn't said anything. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3254.16s)]
*  He could say, what's interesting about him is that he's a great orator and he can sell it better than [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3258.72s)]
*  anybody. That tweet could have landed in a place that wouldn't have gotten him in trouble, [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3263.12s)]
*  but that's not where it went. He went on to say, it's not brains. It's bile. Miller is a man who [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3266.3199999999997s)]
*  is richly endowed with the capacity for hatred. He is a world-class hater. You can see this just [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3273.44s)]
*  by looking at him because you can see that his hatreds are his spiritual nourishment. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3281.12s)]
*  He eats his hate. Trump is a world-class hater, but his hatred is only a means to an end, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3289.6s)]
*  and that end is his own glorification. That's his spiritual nourishment. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3298.32s)]
*  So this is supposed to be an objective, unbiased, right down the middle, not just correspondent, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3305.44s)]
*  but chief national correspondent, a leader within ABC News. And I posted this on X after I saw it. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3312.4s)]
*  He later deleted it when he probably sobered up that he should have been fired immediately. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3319.84s)]
*  There shouldn't have even been a discussion. This is beyond question, a fireable offense for anyone [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3325.52s)]
*  whose job it is to maintain objectivity and to be trusted by the entire country, not just half of it. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3332.08s)]
*  ABC News, having seen lots of tweets and feedback like that, announced the next day and told the [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3337.6800000000003s)]
*  Megyn Kelly Show directly, quote, ABC News stands for objectivity and impartiality [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3344.1600000000003s)]
*  in its news coverage and does not condone subjective personal attacks on others. The [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3352.32s)]
*  post does not reflect the views of ABC News and violated our standards. As a result, Terry Moran [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3357.2000000000003s)]
*  has been suspended pending further evaluation from an ABC News spokesperson, suspended, [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3361.92s)]
*  not fired, no apology to Stephen Miller nor to President Trump from either Moran or ABC, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3368.6400000000003s)]
*  because let's face it, they all agree and are secretly applauding what he wrote. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3376.8s)]
*  Of course, every major journalist in the DC press corps, with maybe one or two exceptions, [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3384.0s)]
*  believes exactly what Terry Moran wrote. What was his big contention? Was it evidence-based? [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3389.12s)]
*  Was it cited? No, it's how he looks. That's right, Megyn. He says you could just tell. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3394.64s)]
*  Okay, well, Terry Moran, we could just tell a lot by looking at you, but that's not relevant to this [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3401.7599999999998s)]
*  discussion, actually. You're a deeply unhappy person who's rage tweeting at six minutes past [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3405.7599999999998s)]
*  midnight against the deputy chief of staff because you don't agree with him politically. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3412.4s)]
*  I mean, okay, so the media trust is at an all-time low, and it's only going lower. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3416.96s)]
*  President Trump has an amazing ability to break these people and to really show them as a mask [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3424.2400000000002s)]
*  soft moment, and ABC has been at the forefront of the peddling of so many hoaxes the last couple [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3428.4s)]
*  of years. I'll be curious your thoughts, Megyn. I actually think he's probably going to be brought [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3435.68s)]
*  back because I don't think they want to try to show that, you know, MAGA got a scalp. He'll, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3440.16s)]
*  you know, be in the wilderness for two or three years and two, three months, try to [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3445.36s)]
*  recover a little bit and come back and say, you know, I was at the time I was a little inebriated [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3448.96s)]
*  and said stuff I shouldn't, and boom, he's back and act as if nothing happened. But [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3454.6400000000003s)]
*  at its fundamental core, the journalists are activists. They're not trying to explore truth. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3459.1200000000003s)]
*  They're not trying to challenge authority. These are activists. These are people, remember, that [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3466.2400000000002s)]
*  actively covered up the biggest political scandal in modern American history, if not American [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3472.64s)]
*  history, which was Biden's cognitive decline, which was who was running the country, who was [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3478.72s)]
*  signing the documents, and people like Terry Moran were actively calling people like me, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3483.84s)]
*  a conspiracy theorist, and you, Megyn, for even saying that he's not running the country, instead [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3489.68s)]
*  it's a unelected Politburo. So I'm actually kind of glad to see this. Terry Moran and his like [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3494.32s)]
*  deserve to be publicly humiliated because the fact that he actually put this out in a tweet [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3500.48s)]
*  goes to show that the private feelings are finally being made public. But make no mistake, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3507.36s)]
*  almost every single journalist that you are reading in the New York Times or CNN shares [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3511.36s)]
*  every sentiment that Terry Moran said publicly. 100%. They hate Stephen Miller. The first term, [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3516.2400000000002s)]
*  there were countless articles about how he's an alleged white supremacist just because he wants [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3522.4s)]
*  to enforce our borders. And that's really what Moran has to be referring to because that's been [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3527.2s)]
*  the most out front position for Miller in Trump 2.02. And that's why he says you can see he's a [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3532.0s)]
*  world-class hater. You can see it just by looking at him because you can see that his hatreds are [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3538.48s)]
*  his spiritual nourishment. He eats his hate. I think there's a bit of projection there, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3545.04s)]
*  right? Or transference, my mom would say it's called. In any event, where it's like his own [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3551.68s)]
*  hatred, it's his TDS right there, which I can see all over him. It's eating him up and he's [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3556.16s)]
*  projecting it or transferring it onto Stephen Miller. Here, let me tell you a little bit about [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3562.16s)]
*  Terry Moran. Terry Moran, just a couple of examples of his past coverage of Trump. In 2021, he referred [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3567.3599999999997s)]
*  to Trump as the furor in the Republican Party during ABC's coverage of the Trump impeachment trial, [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3574.8799999999997s)]
*  saying- Sounds impartial. Yeah, that's how Trump reminded him, mom, that Trump has the Republican [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3582.96s)]
*  Party as a personalized power like we have never seen. It's a cardillo. It's a Caesar. It's a [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3590.1600000000003s)]
*  furor. We don't see that in this country. We do now. He invoked Nazi adjacent comparisons when [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3595.36s)]
*  describing Trump after his first inaugural address in January of 17. It carries with it overtones [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3601.44s)]
*  from the 1930s when an anti-Semitic movement said, we don't want to get involved in Europe's war. [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3606.48s)]
*  It's the Jews fault in Germany. Charles Lindbergh led them. It's a term as he defined it in his way, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3612.8s)]
*  but the words carry ugly echoes in our history. That's how he interpreted Trump's inaugural [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3619.36s)]
*  address. And then let's just see, maybe he's tough on all presidents, Charlie. Maybe he's just got [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3624.88s)]
*  like an anti-authority strain, which is healthy in a reporter. Let's see what he did with Barack [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3628.72s)]
*  Obama when he was taking the office as president back in 2009. Oh, here's the quote. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3632.56s)]
*  Barack Obama is the first president since George Washington to be taking a step down into the Oval [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3638.4s)]
*  office. Unbelievable. He's above the Oval, you see. Barack Obama had accomplished absolutely [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3645.12s)]
*  nothing other than being an Illinois Senator and then a US Senator for one term. For like 18 months. [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3654.4s)]
*  Yes, and actually had absolutely nothing to point to as an accomplishment in that role. But you see, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3660.1600000000003s)]
*  he was taking a step down into the Oval because he's above the presidency. Whereas Trump is the [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3665.2000000000003s)]
*  Fuhrer who's echoing Nazi language from the 1930s in his inaugural address. He got it. So to no one's [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3671.36s)]
*  surprise, he sees Trump and his chief deputy on policy as full of hate. That's eating them alive. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3678.6400000000003s)]
*  And again, I want to just repeat this, that every single one of those people in those briefing room [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3685.92s)]
*  who pretend to be objective, they're identical to his viewpoint. And Megan, this is why I think my [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3691.2s)]
*  podcast is growing and why your podcast is growing, is the American people realize that they have these [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3698.64s)]
*  supercomputers in their right-hand pocket, their iPhones. Why do I have to listen to you Terry [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3703.44s)]
*  Moran? Why do I have to listen to you David Muir? Why do I have to listen to you NBC? I don't even [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3707.84s)]
*  have Lester Holt to still hear. I can't keep track of who's on what. I really don't watch any of the [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3712.96s)]
*  networks. Yeah, I don't watch CBS. I don't watch ABC. I don't watch NBC. The only time I ever see [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3717.44s)]
*  them is when there's like a bubble up of something crazy that they say like Margaret Brennan when JD [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3722.96s)]
*  Vance kind of delivered the truth to her. And but the most important element of this is I wish we [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3727.84s)]
*  actually had a functioning media. It'd be good for our country. It'd be good if people like Terry [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3735.6s)]
*  Moran weren't actually in charge as a senior national correspondent or someone that was in [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3740.4s)]
*  charge of the news flow in our country. We would have a much better nation. We would have a much [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3744.48s)]
*  stronger country, but instead the press corps has done nothing to earn our trust. They never [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3749.76s)]
*  apologized after Russiagate, one of the greatest scandals. They actively covered up Joe Biden. [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3755.76s)]
*  They lied and lied and lied during COVID. Six feet to slow the spread. The vaccine is safe and [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3760.4s)]
*  effective. You got to get masks and vats to save your grandma's life. And we got to show you that [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3764.7200000000003s)]
*  we got to shut down schools. And these people have never apologized. They've shown no contrition [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3769.9199999999996s)]
*  whatsoever. And instead they have hostility, not just to Stephen Miller, but to Trump's voters. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3774.72s)]
*  And you could tell Terry Moran, that kind of rage tweet at like six minutes past midnight. He's like [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3781.44s)]
*  obsessed with Stephen Miller. Like this guy is living rent free in your head that like Stephen [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3787.68s)]
*  Miller's existence is a threat to Terry Moran's inner peace. He's a deeply troubled person who's [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3792.64s)]
*  very unhappy, whose meaning is trying to destroy the lives of others. And that's the other sad part. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3799.68s)]
*  Megan, I agree. If you're kind of like an equal opportunity offender and you kind of go after [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3804.88s)]
*  everybody and expose Republicans, Democrats, fine. That's actually healthy in a reporter. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3808.8s)]
*  But if you seek to be a reporter to make others people's success go away or to destroy others, [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3812.64s)]
*  you're a masochist. That is at its core, one of the more dark elements of the modern media core, [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3820.08s)]
*  where they don't want to actually expose stories. They want to take people out specifically. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3828.56s)]
*  Yeah, they're in costume. They're in costume as they pose as the reporters of yesteryear, [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3832.72s)]
*  when it would have been unheard of. Britt Hume, my mentor at Fox News, was the chief White House [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3839.04s)]
*  correspondent for ABC News at its heyday, covering Ronald Reagan, the Cold War, tossing back to Peter [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3846.0s)]
*  Jennings, who was relentless on his factual pursuit and would just beat up Britt all the time. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3852.96s)]
*  Britt would talk about it. And Britt brought that same gift to our newsroom and to me. And I've [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3858.4s)]
*  greatly benefited from all of it. But he would never, you know how fast Britt would have been [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3863.92s)]
*  fired at ABC back in the day if he had posted anything like that? It would not have been. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3869.52s)]
*  And that's why I know ABC News is not going to fire Terry Moran. They don't need to investigate [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3877.36s)]
*  anything. We already know what the sin was. We read it. It's not like they need time. They just [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3882.88s)]
*  don't think it's a fireable offense. And I'll tell you why they don't think it's a fireable offense. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3887.6s)]
*  Here is their chief news anchor, the face of the network, who they love and promoted every [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3893.6800000000003s)]
*  chance. David Muir in a moment that will be very familiar to you and our audience. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3901.92s)]
*  Mr. President, for three and a half years after you lost the 2020 election, you repeatedly [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3907.84s)]
*  falsely claimed that you won, many times saying you won in a landslide. In the past couple of [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3912.72s)]
*  weeks leading up to this debate, you have said, quote, you lost by a whisker, that you, quote, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3917.52s)]
*  didn't quite make it, that you came up a little bit short. Are you now acknowledging that you lost [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3922.3199999999997s)]
*  in 2020? No, I don't acknowledge that at all. I said that sarcastically. You know that. And we said, [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3928.0s)]
*  oh, we lost by a whisker. That was said sarcastically. Look, there's so much proof. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3932.3199999999997s)]
*  All you have to do is look at it. And they should have sent it back to the legislatures for approval. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3937.6s)]
*  I did watch all of these pieces of video. I didn't detect the sarcasm lost by a whisker. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3942.72s)]
*  We didn't quite make it. And we should just point out here as clarification. And you know this, [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3947.6s)]
*  you and your allies, 60 cases in front of many judges. Many of them looked at it and said, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3951.3599999999997s)]
*  they said we didn't have standing. Okay. He didn't detect the sarcasm at a presidential [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3956.08s)]
*  debate because he's a human lie detector and also feeling czar. And I'll give you one more. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3962.64s)]
*  Here's their chief anchor. That's how they refer to him. I think he used to be chief political. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3967.12s)]
*  Now he's just chief anchor, I guess because they got too much heat. But here's their other [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3970.56s)]
*  favorite, favorite anchor at ABC news. I'm not talking ABC, which would include the view. Don't [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3974.08s)]
*  get me started. These are news men ostensibly at ABC news. Here's their other favorite. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3979.68s)]
*  And you've endorsed Donald Trump for president. Judges and two separate juries have found him [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3988.32s)]
*  liable for rape. Donald Trump has been found liable for rape by a jury. I'm asking you a [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3993.04s)]
*  question about why you endorse someone who's been found liable for rape. Someone who's been [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=3998.16s)]
*  found liable for rape. We have to answer the question. Why are you supporting someone who's [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4002.3199999999997s)]
*  been found liable for rape? They are afraid to come forward, as you said, because they are [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4006.3199999999997s)]
*  defamed by those who commit the rape. You don't find it offensive that Donald Trump has been found [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4010.16s)]
*  liable for rape. Well, actually what you're doing is defending a man who's been found liable for [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4014.16s)]
*  rape. I don't understand how you can do that. The judge affirmed that it was in fact rape. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4018.16s)]
*  Donald Trump was found to have committed rape. That's just a fact. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4023.6s)]
*  It's not a fact. What George Stephanopoulos said was defamatory and it cost ABC news $15 million. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4028.64s)]
*  Neither man was fired, Charlie, and Terry Moran won't be fired either. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4035.92s)]
*  No. And if I remember the case details, it was that he was found liable for like defamation [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4040.48s)]
*  regarding the case with E. Jean Carroll. Anyway, I- [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4046.3199999999997s)]
*  And he was found liable on the underlying claim for committing a sexual assault against [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4049.68s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll, but not for rape. There was a box on the jury form, did he commit rape? [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4055.9199999999996s)]
*  And it was checked, no. Stephanopoulos was totally wrong. You had an activist left wing judge who in [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4061.2s)]
*  writing up what happened in the case later trying to say, well, by saying sexual assault, they meant [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4066.48s)]
*  rape, but that was bullshit. They actually did not find rape. And that's why ABC news had to pay [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4072.48s)]
*  $15 million, but didn't fire the anchor. Of course not. And that's why I don't think Terry [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4078.08s)]
*  Moran will be fired. And by the way, the David Muir thing, there was many other highlights from that [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4086.56s)]
*  or lowlights from that debate with Kamala Harris where President Trump had a debate, [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4091.52s)]
*  literally two people at once. ABC, just like all the other networks, CBS and NBC, of course, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4095.44s)]
*  they should not be trusted. I'm interested to see as their viewership continues to go down, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4102.4s)]
*  will they ever adjust their model? They are so activist driven. They are so concerned with [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4108.4s)]
*  trying to put forward an ideological agenda, not trying to inform the public, not trying to, [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4116.08s)]
*  quote unquote, get both sides. And I had to go back to Terry Moran. What was he thinking? That's [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4123.599999999999s)]
*  who he is though. And again, during moments like this, we have these great reveals where we always [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4130.08s)]
*  knew he felt that way. You could always just tell because, you know, Megan, that's how it works. Now [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4136.08s)]
*  we could just tell by looking at him that there's something discontent when it comes to President [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4140.8s)]
*  Trump. And I want to live in a country where we can trust ABC and CBS and NBC, but they have [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4146.72s)]
*  committed suicide. And because of that, we are seeing ascendant alternative media. And I think [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4155.76s)]
*  the country is better because of it. Here's the thing. You mentioned in your previous answer [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4160.8s)]
*  about how their disdain, the press and the Democrats is not just for Trump, it's for his voters. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4168.8s)]
*  And that is true, which is why, like, they don't care. That's why Terry Moran didn't care about [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4176.4800000000005s)]
*  making that post at 1206 AM. He was like, F these disgusting people. I don't want them watching [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4182.0s)]
*  ABC News. And by the way, I didn't even mention Jimmy Kimmel, who's their late night host, who has [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4187.92s)]
*  actually said, I don't care if you don't watch me. If you don't watch me because I have my stance on [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4193.04s)]
*  the second amendment, good riddance to you. And then he corrected himself. Well, not good riddance, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4197.68s)]
*  but riddance, riddance to you. They don't care. And then out of nowhere, you get Jason Bateman, [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4202.64s)]
*  okay, who, for the most part, I think has done a decent job of keeping himself out of the political [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4210.56s)]
*  lane until he launched this aptly named show smartless, in which he's got two other [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4216.240000000001s)]
*  celeb partners, and they talk about Hollywood and they interview their Hollywood buddies. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4224.080000000001s)]
*  And I don't listen to smart list, but it seems clear to me that they're liberals, which fine, [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4229.280000000001s)]
*  no one cares. You can be a liberal being a stupid liberal who says inane things about the country [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4234.96s)]
*  and about Trump supporters. Now, now we're going to talk. Now you're going to make it onto the [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4239.6s)]
*  Megyn Kelly show. And Charlie Kirk is going to have some thoughts on you. And this is what he said. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4243.84s)]
*  He went on Nicole Wallace's podcast called the best people. It's called the best people. And so [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4249.04s)]
*  she puts him on and listen to what this guy who the whole country, not just lefties, lefties, [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4258.320000000001s)]
*  righties, Trump supporters and others made a multimillionaire made a household name. Listen [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4266.0s)]
*  to the arrogance of this guy. Do you ever see a day and I know this is kind of a third rail for [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4272.64s)]
*  politics, but at what point if ever do you think the story would change from reporting on the [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4278.56s)]
*  outrageousness of Trump and his actions, his decisions, his words, and instead move to the [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4285.76s)]
*  people that have voted for him twice. And I know that goes back to the whole story of deplorables [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4290.96s)]
*  and like as soon as that happened, everyone just backed off and don't ever talk bad about, [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4295.92s)]
*  you know, America and the 80 million. But he's never changed. Like, yeah, he's always been the [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4300.4800000000005s)]
*  same. He didn't do a 180 and dupe everybody when he got to the White House. It's the people that [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4306.8s)]
*  have put him there and then put him there again that really deserve a great deal of responsibility [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4311.4400000000005s)]
*  and a talking to I'm sorry. And I say that with love, talking to it's everything we've been [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4318.32s)]
*  talking about. They either don't believe the bad things. They think Democrats are worse. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4322.96s)]
*  They found something they really didn't like about Biden and then Harris. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4327.52s)]
*  They deserve a talking to because they are the problem. The Trump voters, Charlie. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4334.16s)]
*  Shut up, Marty Bird. That's all I have to say. I mean, it's just the, if you understand the [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4339.52s)]
*  Ozark reference, I mean, look, so first of all, Nicole Wallace is totally insufferable. Like, [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4344.32s)]
*  who would voluntarily spend time listening to her podcast? We'll see if it succeeds. I have my [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4349.2s)]
*  doubts. But look, the what Bateman is getting at, though, is a is a condemnation of America, [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4354.5599999999995s)]
*  which kind of connects with our immigration topic. They hate the country. They and a country is made [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4363.2s)]
*  up of its people. And he has like this belief that if you if you were to go into a diner in Midland, [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4369.28s)]
*  Texas, he has contempt for those people, people that go to church, people that own guns, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4376.64s)]
*  people that actually make the country work. And it is the pomposity that is embedded. And it's [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4382.400000000001s)]
*  nothing really new. We've seen this over the last couple of years. But instead of trying to seek to [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4387.84s)]
*  understand why they're losing the country, to seek to understand why people are voting for President [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4393.280000000001s)]
*  Trump. No, they'll keep on attacking them as deplorables or clingers or as Joe Biden called them [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4399.04s)]
*  garbage. If you remember that right before the election, and it was my Halloween costume. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4405.36s)]
*  Yeah, it was. And when President Trump won were the garbage outfit in Wisconsin, it was one of the [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4410.96s)]
*  more legendary moments. And here's where the again, I'm not here to give Democrats political advice. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4416.16s)]
*  But if you say this, then you're part of the problem. Quote, everyone I know hates Donald Trump, [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4422.5599999999995s)]
*  you're part of the problem. If everybody you know, hates the current president who won a popular [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4428.5599999999995s)]
*  vote majority and an electoral vote landslide, you're you are incapable of understanding the [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4435.28s)]
*  country, especially if you are a journalist, especially if you're a journalist. Charlie, [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4441.759999999999s)]
*  but what about the fact that like he to me, he's just like Michelle Obama, like we made you rich [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4446.24s)]
*  beyond your wildest imagination. This country gave you so much in riches and rewards and let you do [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4452.48s)]
*  the thing that you love so much to act for money. That's something a lot of people would do for free [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4460.88s)]
*  a Gavin Newsom. And, and who's the other one? What's her name? We're like amazing actors, [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4467.2s)]
*  Maxine Waters in their little bits. They're doing it practically for free. But Justin Bateman, [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4473.92s)]
*  from his time on Little House on the Prairie to Ozark and everything in between has received [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4479.84s)]
*  nothing but love from yes, the right half of this country who never gave two shits about his [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4485.76s)]
*  politics and whether he shared theirs or understood them and what is their reward. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4491.4400000000005s)]
*  Once he gets to the so-called top, he feels the need to take a massive dump all over them. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4498.400000000001s)]
*  It's so offensive. It's so out of touch. It's so ungrateful. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4504.96s)]
*  Yeah. And again, it's just there, there's so many elements and wrinkles to this. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4508.88s)]
*  Just to reiterate it further, the, the country cannot continue yet. The country cannot continue [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4514.96s)]
*  if the cultural and political and media elites just don't even seek to understand [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4523.76s)]
*  the half of the country that is falling away from them. And what is so interesting is that [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4530.8s)]
*  almost every single Trump supporter knows people that voted for Kamala Harris. But a lot of Kamala [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4536.08s)]
*  Harris voters don't know anybody that voted for Donald Trump. And I encourage people to run that [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4542.24s)]
*  test. I guarantee you that and, and if you sever a relationship with someone who voted for Donald [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4547.04s)]
*  Trump, you're a bad person. If you are going to sever a relationship based on politics, there's [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4552.24s)]
*  something deeply wrong with you. You're sick, especially, oh, Megan, the worst thing, the worst [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4557.28s)]
*  part of my job, and I travel the country all the time. I have an amazing job, super blessed to [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4563.04s)]
*  speak across the country. The worst part of my job is moms that come up to me and they say, [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4567.12s)]
*  I can't see my grandkids because my son says I'm a Trump supporter. So I'm cut off from seeing my [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4572.64s)]
*  grandkids. It's happening all the time, Megan, that people are holding their grandkids hostage [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4578.32s)]
*  based on political views. And you could extrapolate that in any possible way imaginable. And so I'm [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4583.04s)]
*  not even sure how we're going to heal this. We have to just push, we have to push through it. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4589.28s)]
*  And, and one, one side note on Michelle Obama, can we just note how overrated she is? And like [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4593.36s)]
*  all the hype around Michelle Obama, oh, she's going to run for office. And she's just, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4599.44s)]
*  I don't want to get into the aesthetics of all of it, but the presentation of her podcast is [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4604.4s)]
*  terrible. She's just whining all the time. And she's complaining. Right. Again, I'm not trying to [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4608.8s)]
*  look in people's looks. That's not what I'm doing. I'm just saying the whole aura of it, to use a [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4613.12s)]
*  Gen Z term is terrible. It's negative. It's just kind of her lamenting. And then she's obviously, [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4617.2s)]
*  there's problems with her daughters and all that. I don't want to get into that, but we, we built [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4623.2s)]
*  up on the right. Michelle Obama is going to be the hardest person ever to run against. And her [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4627.04s)]
*  books sold so many copies. And my goodness, you want to talk about the most overrated political [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4631.5199999999995s)]
*  hype of a generation. It would go to Michelle Obama. Anyway, that's just the side note that's been on my mind for a while. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4637.84s)]
*  You're so right. I'm happy to make fun of her look. It's very strange. It was Benny Johnson, [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4641.84s)]
*  who dubbed that one hairstyle of the stegosaurus. I'm not getting into that. Three bumps on the back, [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4646.8s)]
*  stegosaurus. It's very strange. Speaking of Michelle Obama and her podcast and Democrats who diminish [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4651.6s)]
*  Republican voters as a bunch of no nothings or villains in Jason Bateman's case. By the way, [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4660.16s)]
*  I'm on team Justine Bateman. She's the best Bateman. Here is Michelle Obama. I don't know, within the [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4666.96s)]
*  past week or so, I've been trying to get to the sound bite for a couple of days now on Trump voters, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4674.16s)]
*  female voters in particular. This is a woman supposed to understand America and the women of [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4679.28s)]
*  America. And she supports other women. She's a feminist hero. Here she is. Can't wait to hear this. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4683.76s)]
*  This is why I implore, implore the men in the world who have women that they say they care about, [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4690.8s)]
*  daughters that they are raising, that this is their issue too. I mean, for men to sit on their [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4700.0s)]
*  hands over this issue and trade out women's health for a tax break or whatever it is, [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4709.12s)]
*  is a sad statement about that man's level of value of the women in their lives. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4717.12s)]
*  And there are a lot of men who have, they have big chairs at their tables. There are a lot of women [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4725.76s)]
*  who vote the way their man is going to vote. It happened in this election. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4733.2s)]
*  Got it. Republican women are too dumb to make up their own minds about President Trump. They did [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4741.52s)]
*  it because they're men. Told them to, after that ridiculous, remember that ad the Democrats ran [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4746.4800000000005s)]
*  with Julia Roberts' voiceover where the women like secretly. Oh, I remember. It's our little [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4751.36s)]
*  secret. Yep. I remember. This is what they think of Republican women. Of course. I mean, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4754.88s)]
*  first of all, just like the embedded kind of just implied chauvinism that all of our relationships [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4761.12s)]
*  in the Trump world are like, we tell our wives exactly what to do. It's like, okay, no, we all [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4768.0s)]
*  have agency. Okay. Secondly, I just have to comment on this. She's really lost a step. Just embedded [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4772.719999999999s)]
*  in her language is like, she's really let Donald Trump break her. I mean, she used to have, don't [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4779.6s)]
*  you agree? She used to present a lot better and with like more zest and more energy and more [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4785.200000000001s)]
*  intensity. It's like this Michelle Obama just looks broken. She's kind of doing the wine mom [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4790.160000000001s)]
*  thing. And she's just kind of like, I'm just like, just kind of meandering through life. Anyway, [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4796.72s)]
*  I'm not upset about it. Populated like every 30 seconds with what about me? No one asks about me. [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4802.56s)]
*  Exactly. Or I mean, just, I mean, for, and Megan, I know, I know you'll take this in good stride, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4808.48s)]
*  but she's like, we black women need to complain more. Yeah. That's the problem with black women [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4813.2s)]
*  is not enough complaining. She said that like a couple of weeks ago. I mean, like it just, [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4817.12s)]
*  I'll put that aside and people can, that's definitely the problem in the black community, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4820.5599999999995s)]
*  right? Not enough complaining. But anyway, to her, she's doing more than her fair share. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4824.639999999999s)]
*  Oh, yes. No, she's, she's at, she's at her complaining quotient, but I guess she's talking [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4830.799999999999s)]
*  about abortion there as if like, oh, you know, woman's health, but let me, let me just be clear. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4836.24s)]
*  Not a single Trump voting male in the world is ever going to be one over by complaining [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4841.679999999999s)]
*  Michelle Obama, just to make sure we're all keeping score here. Right? Just there's not, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4848.08s)]
*  there's not a welder right now in Des Moines, Iowa. That's like, you're right. I'm going to go [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4853.04s)]
*  vote for the Democrat party because Michelle Obama makes such a great case and a great point. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4856.88s)]
*  But what an insult as Michelle Obama is silent on the, the, the stealing of women's championships [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4862.4s)]
*  from men, as if there's just like one issue that we have to hyper focus on. And the Democrat party [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4868.719999999999s)]
*  tried that this last November and it failed as it turns out that there is a lot more issues than [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4875.36s)]
*  that one that Michelle Obama wants us to hyper fix it up. Here's, uh, here's the, the other thing [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4880.719999999999s)]
*  about Michelle Obama. She is at every turn, she is talking about how much she can't stand her [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4887.68s)]
*  husband. Uh, she can't stand marriage and she can't, she can't stand America. I could talk [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4893.4400000000005s)]
*  about Michelle Obama for an hour. I think this is hilarious. I just think it's great. It's truly [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4899.76s)]
*  amazing. So, but like it's not, what's interesting about her. Yes. Is how you're right. She's lost a [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4904.0s)]
*  step and we all thought she'd be way more quote fierce than she turned out to be, but she is a [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4908.400000000001s)]
*  mouthpiece for the Democrat party, both officially and unofficially. The unofficial part is what's [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4914.0s)]
*  interesting. Like in the same way, Terry Moran gave us a view behind the veil on how journalists [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4919.2s)]
*  behave. She gave us a view on how the vast majority of her party does feel about Republicans, [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4923.52s)]
*  about Republican women. Like it's, it's actually not that surprising to see how much she can't [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4928.8s)]
*  stand us. And I mentioned that ad that ad that was put out by Democrats. They wanted us to see it. [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4934.48s)]
*  It was all about how women should disobey their overbearing Republican husbands. [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4941.12s)]
*  No, that's right. I forgot about that. That's exactly right. Yes. Here it is. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4946.88s)]
*  This is the Democrats and Julia Roberts. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4950.5599999999995s)]
*  Your turn, honey. In the one place in America where women still have a right to choose, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4956.16s)]
*  you can vote any way you want. Two women are looking at each other and no one will [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4963.84s)]
*  have to hover over Tim walls and they fell out for Kamala. Did you make the right choice? [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4969.28s)]
*  Sure did honey. Remember what happens in the booth stays in the booth. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4974.32s)]
*  Terry Moran, Justin Bateman, Julia Roberts, Michelle Obama. It's a Democrat problem. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4980.8s)]
*  Yes. And I just, as a side note to that ad, I, it is so destructive and bad. You want to know why [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4989.92s)]
*  we have a rebellion, Michelle Obama? Cause in every caricature of white men, they come across [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=4995.36s)]
*  as space cadets in every fictional caricature, right? They're dumb. They're kind of, you know, [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5001.04s)]
*  happy go, I don't know what's going on. Right. And you want to, we, as men are tired of being [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5006.719999999999s)]
*  portrayed that way. You can kind of tell these just kind of like, Oh, you know, did you vote for the [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5011.679999999999s)]
*  right person? Just, they're trying to make it look as if he's kind of clueless and that there's [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5015.759999999999s)]
*  really no marital bond there. They're trying to make him seem inbred. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5019.679999999999s)]
*  And I just, I really, I find it so objectionable as, as an American man who wants to see, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5023.36s)]
*  you know, a resurgence of the best form of masculinity is just that sort of, you know, [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5030.0s)]
*  that beating down of the lowest form of man is really, really bad. And it needs to stop. And we [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5035.5199999999995s)]
*  see it in all sorts of fictional telling of it's always the dad who kind of doesn't know what's [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5042.0s)]
*  going on. Doesn't pay the bills. He's like mildly overweight anyway, but no, the at its core, Michelle [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5046.639999999999s)]
*  Obama is a very interesting story because the Democrats thought that she would save them at some [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5052.64s)]
*  point because they're so celebrity focused on the Democrat party. And hilariously, we, as [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5058.08s)]
*  Republicans have never been celebrity focused. We just happened to get Donald Trump, we kind of came [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5063.280000000001s)]
*  down the escalator and kind of just reinvigorated the Republican party in a way we never could. [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5067.52s)]
*  But now the Democrat party, I look around, who are they going to turn to? And again, that's a whole [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5072.72s)]
*  deeper and more, you know, robust conversation. But America does not want someone who is just [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5076.72s)]
*  going to kind of emotionalist complain their way to the future of the Democrat party. And, [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5084.400000000001s)]
*  yeah, one last note on that ad. Not only did it not work, I think it backfired in a major way. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5092.16s)]
*  I think a lot of moms and a lot of wives found it to be so insulting that marriages are just kind of [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5097.6s)]
*  these kind of separate domains and they're not a covenant between husband and wife. And I remember [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5104.8s)]
*  I came out really hard against that ad, Megan, and so many libs were like, I'm never going to [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5109.76s)]
*  tell my husband who I vote for. It's none of his business. I'm like, yeah, I'm sure that marriage [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5115.6s)]
*  is going to last really long. Right. That sounds like a recipe for success. But that's what they [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5120.56s)]
*  think of Republicans. They think if you have a traditional marriage, let's say, or one in which [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5126.88s)]
*  the husband is the primary wage earner and the mom is a more traditional state home wife, [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5132.48s)]
*  that she's controlled by the husband. Like you say, she has no agency. She's not her own person. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5137.28s)]
*  She can't make up her own mind or make come to her own decisions. She's a no nothing Neanderthal. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5142.24s)]
*  And this is female empowerment in their view to paint Republican women who choose a different [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5146.879999999999s)]
*  path from Michelle Obama as absolute Nimrods who can't make up their own minds are just controlled [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5152.16s)]
*  by their husbands and really just need to be coaxed into that voting box to have one moment [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5157.44s)]
*  of empowerment and it would be to vote for Kamala Harris. It's not, as I point out, this is a, this [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5161.36s)]
*  is a, this is all of them. I mean, I keep calling him Justin Bateman because I really want to make [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5166.08s)]
*  him into Justine, who's the good Bateman. He's Jason, but it's not just Jason Bateman. It's not [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5170.32s)]
*  just Michelle Obama. It's not just Terry Moran. All these people, these Democrats spokesmen, [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5175.5199999999995s)]
*  both the officials and the unofficials, the celebs, the non celebs, that, that is how they [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5180.719999999999s)]
*  see the right half of the country. And we have to stop patronizing their films, their television [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5184.5599999999995s)]
*  projects, their podcasts and making them rich. Why are we helping them? You know, George Clooney [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5189.52s)]
*  is the latest, of course, who was totally complicit in covering up the Joe Biden mental [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5196.0s)]
*  infirmity until he imploded and his loser play is now being aired on CNN because I guess they [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5200.400000000001s)]
*  haven't gotten enough eyeballs on it. So they aired it on Saturday night. Apparently nobody [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5207.76s)]
*  watched except for Brian Stelter. Brian Stelter watched it and thought it was deeply profound, [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5211.68s)]
*  Charlie. It was deeply profound. And then he gave an interview, George Clooney did on CNN. And here's [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5215.44s)]
*  a clip from his predictions. I know you were waiting. You think you're close to Trump world. [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5222.4s)]
*  He's even, he's even closer. He's got the inside scoop on what's going to happen with Trumpism [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5226.639999999999s)]
*  post Donald Trump. It's SOP 31. Do you think Trumpism last beyond this term? Don't think so. I [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5232.0s)]
*  think it'd be very hard to do it. Remember this. Donald Trump is a celebrity. That's what he is. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5242.48s)]
*  I mean, he's got a, you know, he has a star on Hollywood Boulevard. I don't have a star [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5247.679999999999s)]
*  on Hollywood Boulevard. I'm not lobbying for one. I'm just saying, you know, seems like an oversight, [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5251.5199999999995s)]
*  by the way. What's going on? He's a celebrity and he's the president of the United States. And so [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5256.96s)]
*  he has been elected, duly elected. Fair deal. I'm not complaining about that. That's how it works. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5263.12s)]
*  That's how this democracy works. But he's also a celebrity and he is charming. And to the people [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5267.76s)]
*  who like him, they think he's funny. To a great many others, they don't. And so when he is finished [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5274.0s)]
*  and he will be finished, they're going to have to go looking for someone who can deliver the message [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5281.52s)]
*  that he delivered with the same kind of charisma. And they don't have that. Thoughts? [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5286.8s)]
*  Well, first of all, I have to say, I hate how good of an actor he is. I'm sorry. I just have to say [[01:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5294.56s)]
*  it. He's like actually a good actor. I know people might disagree, but I do think he's a good actor. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5301.120000000001s)]
*  Number two, that's a little bit actually more of a watered down Clooney than I would have expected [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5306.8s)]
*  before watching that. Meaning he like acknowledged Trump won and it was, it was a little less like [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5311.52s)]
*  rage induced. It was better than the Bateman clip. Let me put it that way. It was much better than [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5316.72s)]
*  the Bateman one. But the third one, I think that Clooney of course is wrong about the fundamental [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5320.48s)]
*  thing. I think that Trumpism or MAGAism, which is a better way of putting it, is here to stay. We have [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5326.799999999999s)]
*  JD Vance. We have this whole network of decentralized truth tellers. You're one of them, Megan. I'm one [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5332.719999999999s)]
*  of them. Tucker's, you know, we have this incredible network that is going to push this forward. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5338.0s)]
*  And that is big time Democrat cope if they think that this is just celebrity. It's a lot [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5342.959999999999s)]
*  deeper than that. There is a philosophical, there's a philosophical worldview under the Trump [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5350.4s)]
*  movement. And it might shift a little bit. It might adjust, but it would, it is what our nation [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5356.799999999999s)]
*  matters more than abstract globalist ideology that we don't want men and female sports. We can call [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5362.24s)]
*  it common sense, but a return to the normal life, a return to the good life in America, [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5368.5599999999995s)]
*  which is you're able to get married and have children out, be worried that your eight year [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5374.5599999999995s)]
*  old is going to have transgender pornography presented to them that they want. We want to [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5378.5599999999995s)]
*  have a border. We don't want to have endless war. I don't think that those sentiments are going [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5383.679999999999s)]
*  anywhere, Megan. In fact, I think they are here to stay. I think that they've taken over the [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5388.24s)]
*  Republican party and George Clooney can wish it and can hope for it, but it is a major cope to [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5392.719999999999s)]
*  just think that Donald Trump's ascent and popularity is simply due to his popularity as a celebrity. [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5398.719999999999s)]
*  I think it's a lot deeper than that. It's about a worldview that has become very popular with the [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5405.44s)]
*  American people. Yeah. You just wait and find out George Clooney. You just wait and see if it was [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5410.4s)]
*  just Donald. Right. Mark the moment. We're on the subject of Broadway with George Clooney. So I've [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5415.919999999999s)]
*  got to show you, because this ties in perfectly. Another reason why Donald Trump is not going to [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5422.32s)]
*  be a person specific phenomenon is the Democrats have lost their mind culturally. Last night was [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5426.32s)]
*  the Tony Awards. These are the awards like we have the Emmys for television. We have the Oscars for [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5434.08s)]
*  movies and we have the Tonys for Broadway. And the person who won for best actor, which is [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5438.96s)]
*  interesting. That is a gendered term. Best actor in a play is someone named Cole Escola. And now I [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5444.72s)]
*  am showing you a picture of Cole Escola, which from afar you might not recognize as anything [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5451.44s)]
*  controversial. But if you zoom in on his silver dress with a massive train, you will see something [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5455.76s)]
*  there, Charlie Kirk. Do you see it? You might see it in the morning every day when you maybe [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5461.52s)]
*  shave your face. There's a lot of chest hair down below because you're a man. And so is Cole in a [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5466.160000000001s)]
*  dress accepting for best actor, but a showing off the decolletage area with full male chest hair [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5471.84s)]
*  because he's a they them, but he accepts the award for best actor. He's starring in Oh Mary, [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5482.88s)]
*  where of course he has been cast as Mary Todd Lincoln. They've chosen a male actor. As I told [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5489.44s)]
*  the audience, I've seen this myself in Macbeth where they had a female playing the son of the [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5494.639999999999s)]
*  king and she was somebody who had a blue Mohawk. Okay. This is Broadway in today's day and age, [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5499.28s)]
*  except for Operation Mincemeat, which people should run to see. And let me give you another [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5504.879999999999s)]
*  cultural problem. The media continuing our same themes. The Washington Post voted Cole's one of [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5509.04s)]
*  the nine best looks on the red carpet Sunday night quote, from the Gibson girl updo to the impeccably [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5515.76s)]
*  groomed chest hair all the way down to the saucy bustle at the back. This whole look is a plucky [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5523.68s)]
*  style move befitting a trailblazing Broadway star. People Magazine too. Escola wore a showstopping [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5531.360000000001s)]
*  Cinderella blue gown inspired by the gown Bernadette Peters wore to the 1999 ceremony, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5539.84s)]
*  showstopping and praising the look as one of the best with all of the male hair hanging out. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5545.68s)]
*  It's definitely showstopping. This is a very important topic and we probably don't have [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5554.96s)]
*  enough time to cover it, but the great Roger Scruton, who was really big into aesthetics and [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5560.4800000000005s)]
*  art and he was a conservative in the 20th century, early 21st century, he would talk [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5564.88s)]
*  about how cultural degradation is ugly. And boy is that true. It's just, again, I'm not going to go [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5570.0s)]
*  after like the physical looks of this guy. It's just the whole appearance is just such an affront [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5576.72s)]
*  to our senses. Nothing about that is elevating or pleasing to look at a dude in a dress. I think [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5581.92s)]
*  that's a biological and I can't keep track biological guy in a dress. But he's wearing a dress with [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5587.84s)]
*  chest hair all over and the fact that the media and the critics like it goes to show that it's not [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5594.56s)]
*  about an appreciation of what would be considered to be beautiful. Instead it is about deconstruction. [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5601.280000000001s)]
*  It's about taking apart. Oh wow, a man with chest hair in a dress. That is boundary pushing. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5611.120000000001s)]
*  And you are only continuing in the spiral of chaos and destruction. And again, it just goes to show [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5616.4800000000005s)]
*  like who wants to look at that? I mean you had that up on screen here. It's just gross. It's just [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5623.28s)]
*  kind of objectionable. But that is the left. The left is visually ugly on the outside and they are [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5628.32s)]
*  philosophically ugly on the inside. Well, I'm sorry but I'm gonna have to bring up Kathy Griffin. [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5636.8s)]
*  I mean a week after we were- Oh great. What a rock star. I know. I'm sorry. You're never going [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5642.88s)]
*  to come back at this rate. But a week after we were forced to revisit the Rosie O'Donnell examination [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5647.04s)]
*  of her herpy sore, which she blamed on President Trump, we have to talk about Kathy Griffin who, [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5652.4s)]
*  I'm just going to be honest, isn't- she's not doing her best. That's obvious. The Daily Mail [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5657.2s)]
*  ran photographs of Kathy Griffin out on a walk the other day and she was unrecognizable. She looks [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5662.08s)]
*  like she has aged to twice her actual age out there walking in the wilderness. I'm not sure what's [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5666.96s)]
*  going on with her other than deep unhappiness. We'll put the picture on the board as soon as my [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5672.4s)]
*  team gets it. But she's not doing very well. Okay, so this is her actually just sitting in [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5676.32s)]
*  an interview. This isn't it. But I'll show you in a minute. Then she goes over to the Don Lemon [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5681.44s)]
*  podcast. That's of course what you're going to get over on Don Lemon. And they said the thing [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5685.759999999999s)]
*  you're not allowed to say, Charlie. You're definitely- I am assured you are not allowed [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5690.32s)]
*  to say this thing. But they said the thing only in a different way. So it is allowed. You'll follow [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5693.44s)]
*  what I mean when you hear stop 35. Are you ready for a tin foil hat moment? Yes. Okay, I'm just [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5698.4s)]
*  going to be bold and say this. And you know, you can take issue with this all you want. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5704.719999999999s)]
*  I do not think he won in a free and fair election. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5710.400000000001s)]
*  How do you like that, lefties? Yeah, I said it. I'm Kathy Griffin. And I do not think [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5717.52s)]
*  Trump won in a free and fair election. I believe there was tampering. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5724.160000000001s)]
*  I don't know. I don't know if it was the Elon connection. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5728.0s)]
*  Your gut is telling you something. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5732.4800000000005s)]
*  My gut is telling me that something was up with him. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5734.0s)]
*  You're not far off. I won't say that I disagree with you. But I'm an evidence person. I'd like [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5736.08s)]
*  to see the evidence. I think something was off. And especially when someone said, oh, we've got [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5742.88s)]
*  this. And how do you know that? Okay, Don Lemon, you literally thought that that missing Malaysia [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5747.92s)]
*  flight went into a black hole. So I don't think you could call yourself an evidence person. Yeah, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5755.68s)]
*  so Trump stole the election. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5760.4s)]
*  They are threats to democracy, both of them. How dare they? This is the stuff insurrection is made [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5763.36s)]
*  of. Can we also just pause and say how bad the left is at the podcast game? Once you take these [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5771.679999999999s)]
*  people off of the corporate funded cable news box, it tells you a lot about whether or not that [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5777.92s)]
*  person is talented. Megan, to your great credit, you're thriving even more on the podcast space [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5786.48s)]
*  because you have real talent and you really pursue truth and people love listening to you. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5791.28s)]
*  No one's listening to Don Lemon because he doesn't have any talent. He was just the diversity pick [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5795.839999999999s)]
*  you put up on CNN. And you could see this with Brian Stelter. He failed or Chuck Todd. He's doing [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5801.679999999999s)]
*  his podcast. Nobody's listening to any of their stuff because they were nothing more than just a [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5806.5599999999995s)]
*  teleprompter reader for their assigned network. That's all they were. Just read it and you're done. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5813.68s)]
*  And then as soon as you take them outside of the box and they have to go survive out in the wild, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5820.16s)]
*  their shows don't do well. Nobody cares about it. No one actually wants to watch that content [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5826.08s)]
*  because the way that cable works, especially CNN and MSNBC, those two networks in particular, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5831.92s)]
*  is that it's not meritocratic. It's not. It's that it's very much you climb the ladder based on [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5839.92s)]
*  if you can appease your boss and if you can kind of trade favors. As soon as you get into the podcast [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5846.4s)]
*  space, none of that matters. Your audience will be brutal to you. You're not interesting. I'm done. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5851.6s)]
*  You're not making sense. You're not going after the stories I like. And so every day you and I [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5858.32s)]
*  probably get reports, Megan, downloads, uniques, how are we doing on the podcast charts? It's very, [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5862.64s)]
*  very, very metric driven. And now Don Lamont and Kathy Griffin just goes to show they actually [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5867.68s)]
*  have never had any talent. You take them out of that corporate funded environment, they fail. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5873.12s)]
*  And then as far as the election denial goes, I just laugh. For four years we were all called [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5878.400000000001s)]
*  the worst people in the world because an election, 42,000 votes determined a presidential election [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5884.72s)]
*  across three states, 10,000 votes in Arizona, 11,000 votes in Georgia and 21,000 votes in Wisconsin [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5890.16s)]
*  in a way where mass mail-in voting was never embraced ever before. We had mass verifiable [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5896.08s)]
*  censorship of the Hunter Biden laptop and Molly Hemingway's terrific book. And we just asked [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5900.5599999999995s)]
*  questions and we were being told we were threats to democracy. But now Kathy Griffin thinks that [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5905.76s)]
*  what? Elon satellites help Donald Trump win? Yeah. Keep going, Kathy Griffin. You look great. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5910.16s)]
*  Speaking of Elon, what's your take on the Elon Trump feud? [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5916.4s)]
*  You know, I've, I know both of them quite well. I think that at some point they're going to [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5920.4800000000005s)]
*  reconcile. I actually spoke to the president yesterday and I didn't speak about that in [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5926.08s)]
*  particular, but we spoke about a lot of stuff and he's in great spirits trying to end wars and [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5930.08s)]
*  trying to, you know, get the country back into a better place. We did talk about the riots. I told [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5933.84s)]
*  them we stand behind him a hundred percent. I hope they reconcile. I think that they're much [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5937.92s)]
*  stronger together. Elon's already deleted those tweets and you can already see he's signaling [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5942.08s)]
*  kind of more support for the Trump administration on his Twitter in the last 24 hours. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5948.08s)]
*  I would not be shocked if, and again, I made this prediction the day it all happened and people made [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5953.2s)]
*  fun of me and they were media articles against me. I said, don't be surprised if Elon Musk stops by [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5957.599999999999s)]
*  Mar-a-Lago for two scoops of ice cream before Christmas. People said, oh no way. I said, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5963.04s)]
*  look, I know both these guys. And I also, I know men. I know men when they fight in a super intense [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5967.599999999999s)]
*  way. It's almost very funny. Like men are like, they get angry very, very quick, but they also [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5973.52s)]
*  forgive very quick. I mean, I've seen fights of men where they are saying the worst possible things [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5979.120000000001s)]
*  and they're out getting beers afterwards and they kind of just reconcile quite easily. And so I am [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5983.280000000001s)]
*  hopeful, optimistic, I'm gonna do everything I possibly can to try to bring this back together [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5988.88s)]
*  because I think we are stronger together. And look, I want to thank Elon for buying X and [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5992.4800000000005s)]
*  liberating X. I think he's done some great stuff with Doge. Obviously, I don't like what he said [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=5997.68s)]
*  on X and I don't agree with a lot of it. In fact, he deleted it. So I don't know if he even agrees [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6001.68s)]
*  with some of the stuff now that is a couple of days later. So I hope these two titans can come [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6005.6s)]
*  together to keep trying to save America. Totally agree with every word you said. It was my take on [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6009.68s)]
*  it when it happened as well. They're going to make up. This is not permanent. There's a, there's a [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6014.320000000001s)]
*  total fight and especially people with big egos and big responsibilities and big personalities. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6018.4800000000005s)]
*  And it's temporary and he's not going to be a Democrat and supporting Democrat candidates. [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6022.96s)]
*  No way. Okay, stand by. Wait a minute. Oh no, we're saying goodbye. Oh, we had so much that we [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6028.32s)]
*  didn't get to Charlie. God, there's too much news and too little time, but it's a pleasure. I know. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6034.48s)]
*  He's talking to you. We could go over another hour. Thanks for being here. You're the best. [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6038.48s)]
*  Thanks so much. Tomorrow on the show, one of the most fierce female reporters in the business, [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6043.36s)]
*  Miranda Devine. She's so good. She's from the New York Post. We can't get her that often. [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6048.48s)]
*  And we have her. So we're going to have some fun with her. Don't miss that. [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6052.639999999999s)]
*  It was not supposed to get this bad. Maybe you were on top of your bills, but then inflation hit [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6057.12s)]
*  groceries, gas, everything shot up. Prices are up 26% from just a few years ago. 26. It's not [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6062.48s)]
*  necessarily your fault if you've fallen into debt. Let me share a smarter, faster, far easier way out [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6069.68s)]
*  of it. It's called done with debt. And they're not like other debt relief companies. They don't push [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6075.36s)]
*  loans or bankruptcy on you. Done with debt has legendary negotiators who will go head to head with [[01:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6080.08s)]
*  your credit card and loan companies. They have one goal to drastically reduce or eliminate your [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6085.36s)]
*  debt altogether. They move lightning fast. Most clients see more money in their pocket month one. [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6089.759999999999s)]
*  But a word to the wise, hurry, because some of their debt erasing strategies are time sensitive. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PPJnL8Wp4gM&t=6095.5199999999995s)]
