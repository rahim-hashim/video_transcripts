# Hegseth's Media Mic Drop on Iran Strikes, "Daddy" Trump, and Mamdani's White Guilt Win, w/ Ruthless
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 26, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. We begin today with reaction [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=0.0s)]
*  to a historic press briefing at the Pentagon this morning. Wow, did this one deliver? [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4.24s)]
*  We haven't seen anything like this in a very long time. Nothing's coming to mind [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=10.96s)]
*  in my history as a reporter. Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth and chairman of the joint chiefs of [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  staff, Dan Raisen Kane, delivering an update on President Trump's strikes on three Iranian [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=20.16s)]
*  nuclear sites over the weekend. And it was fascinating. Secretary Hegseth calling the [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=26.32s)]
*  bombing's quote a resounding success and said it was the most complex and secretive military [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=32.08s)]
*  operation in history. And I don't know about that, like developing the atom bomb was that was pretty [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=38.32s)]
*  big. It was complex and it was secretive, but I take his point. It was one of, I think that's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=43.04s)]
*  probably what he meant to say. He said the bombings directly led to a ceasefire agreement, true, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=47.36s)]
*  and an end to what the administration is calling the 12 day war between Israel and Iran. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=52.96s)]
*  And the defense secretary took the media in that room to task because the Pentagon media has been [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=58.08s)]
*  a failure, a total and utter failure in reporting on this administration and in particular, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=63.839999999999996s)]
*  this mission for not playing it straight on this. I mean, yes, it's the Trump administration, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=70.56s)]
*  so they would love to praise, but that's not the media's job. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=77.12s)]
*  But just play it straight. Normally, there's not an instinct or shouldn't be to shit all over the [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=80.88000000000001s)]
*  military heroes after they risk their lives. That's really not been our thing since Vietnam, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=89.2s)]
*  and then we learned those lessons. It is a strain of leftism. They veered dangerously close to doing [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  that when the Iraq war got launched. But for some reason now, because Trump is the commander in [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=102.16s)]
*  chief, I guess it's fine to just not give any credit to the brave pilots who conducted this [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=107.44s)]
*  mission. I mean, truly risked their lives to conduct this mission. It's just more important [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=113.6s)]
*  to rip on Trump, you see. And Hegseth knows that both as a former member of the military [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=119.44s)]
*  and as defense secretary in a key part of the Trump administration himself. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=124.88s)]
*  So he went after them for how they've covered Operation Midnight Hammer. That's what they're [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=128.48s)]
*  calling this based on a selective leak from what we know was a preliminary low confidence [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=133.84s)]
*  intelligence assessment. Let me just tell you something. You know, Catherine Harridge, [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=143.35999999999999s)]
*  we worked together at Fox News for many years. She was our Intel reporter over there, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=146.16s)]
*  and she went to CBS and did it for many years. And this is what she said in a post today on [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=150.88s)]
*  preliminary assessments labeled low confidence. In the hierarchy of Intel reports, a preliminary [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=157.76s)]
*  assessment with low confidence would not carry much weight. It's an early snapshot that concedes [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=164.64s)]
*  the picture will likely change as more intelligence is developed based on that. So that's normally why [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=170.88s)]
*  the Pentagon would not release such a thing to the public, but some asshole within the Pentagon [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=177.35999999999999s)]
*  working for the Defense Intelligence Agency leaked it. And who did this person go to? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=183.28s)]
*  They went to a reporter by the name of Natasha Bertrand, who is the person who has been the [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=190.08s)]
*  best denographer for deep state type Intel operatives. This is the person who had the [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=198.64s)]
*  scoop on how 51 intelligence agents say the Hunter Biden laptop is Russian disinformation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=206.0s)]
*  She led the reporting on Russia, Russia, Russia gate info. We'll have more on her later, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=213.28s)]
*  but my point is simply there's a reason that some Trump hater within the Pentagon went to a [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=219.28s)]
*  different Trump hater now working for CNN, who's got a long history of Trump hating that has [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=225.52s)]
*  completely undermined any credibility this young woman hoped to have. She's very young, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=231.92s)]
*  but she keeps getting awards and Emmys because if you just say terrible things about Trump, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=238.48s)]
*  especially if you can put an Intel source behind them, you'll win awards. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=242.56s)]
*  In any event, she's the one who got this whole thing started saying that the operation was a [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=246.95999999999998s)]
*  failure. It was a fucking failure. Sorry. And so now it's now at the point where you've got [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=250.64s)]
*  the chairman of the joint chiefs and the secretary of defense, because the media ran with this is [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=257.12s)]
*  snowballed going out there to say, just sit down. Okay. Sit down. And by the way, neither the New [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=262.32s)]
*  York times nor CNN even noted that this preliminary assessment was of quote, low confidence in their [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=270.0s)]
*  initial reports on this. We pointed this out in a M update. Neither one pointed out that the [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=276.72s)]
*  assessment was of low confidence. Do you think that might be relevant? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=282.56s)]
*  Could that be relevant? Maybe the audience should be told that. Just asking. Here's Hegseth [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=286.88s)]
*  this morning. Because you, and I mean specifically you, the press, specifically you, the press corps, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=294.08s)]
*  because you cheer against Trump so hard, it's like in your DNA and in your blood to cheer against [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=302.4s)]
*  Trump. Because you want him not to be successful so bad. You have to cheer against the efficacy of [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=309.04s)]
*  these strikes. You have to hope maybe they weren't effective. Maybe the way the Trump [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  administration is representative isn't true. So let's take half truths, spun information, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=320.8s)]
*  leaked information, and then spin it. Spin it in every way we can to try to cause doubt [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=327.68s)]
*  and manipulate the mind, the public mind over whether or not our brave pilots were successful. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=334.24s)]
*  Secretary Hegseth then turned the press conference over to Chairman Cain, who revealed the [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=344.24s)]
*  extraordinary skill and true heroism of service members whose stories seldom reach the public. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=349.6s)]
*  It's so extraordinary to get a play by play like this. He began by describing exactly how the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=358.4s)]
*  military shot down those 14 missiles heading at them. Iran fired them in the wake of our [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=364.96s)]
*  dropping the bombs on Iranian nuclear sites. And this was Iran's retaliation, you'll recall, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=372.96s)]
*  against American air bases, one when I think to Iraq, but in Qatar on Monday. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=379.84s)]
*  Roughly 44 American soldiers responsible for defending the entire base to include [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=385.84000000000003s)]
*  CENTCOM's forward headquarters in the Middle East. The oldest soldier was a 28 year old captain. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=392.88s)]
*  The youngest was a 21 year old private who'd been in the military for less than two years. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=400.88s)]
*  You at that age are the sole person responsible to defend this base. These awesome humans, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=407.44s)]
*  along with their Qatari brothers and sisters in arms, stood between a salvo of Iranian missiles [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=414.72s)]
*  and the safety of valued deed. They are the unsung heroes of the 21st century United States Army. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=421.44000000000005s)]
*  He described what it was like for them to be sitting there and understanding that they had [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=430.88000000000005s)]
*  120 seconds to act to strike down these incoming missiles with our own patriot missiles, which, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=436.48s)]
*  you know, end them and protect us. And how, you know, these young guys, this one guy, the 21 year [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=443.12s)]
*  old guy had been in the armed services for less than two years. Think of it. It's so great when [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=448.0s)]
*  they put that sort of human element onto these reports. The general then explained just how much [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  time and effort went into the bombing. There were three nuclear sites that we bombed, but in [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=461.92s)]
*  particular, the one at Fordow. And it was crazy. That's the one that truly it was like the Top Gun [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=467.2s)]
*  Maverick operation. If you haven't seen Top Gun Maverick, you've got to download that movie tonight [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  with your family, because it's all about how there was a nuclear site of a foreign government that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=478.24s)]
*  we needed to hit where they were enriching uranium. It was going to be in this very skinny little [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=482.56s)]
*  valley that would be very difficult to get into and fly an F-16 into or what looked like one of [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=486.96s)]
*  these B-2 bombers. And you're going to have to reach Mach 10 and it was going to be impossible [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=494.08s)]
*  to maneuver. And it could only be done by a couple of planes. They had to get in and get out and they [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=500.88s)]
*  could get shot down. And one was going to sort of loosen the spigot on the site. Another was going [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=504.47999999999996s)]
*  to drop the big bomb that was going to take it out. I mean, it's like, it's got so many parallels, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=508.88s)]
*  not perfect, but a lot of parallels. So he explained much more about the strike on the nuclear facility [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=512.72s)]
*  at Fordow. Much like in the hunt for Osama bin Laden, where we'd been on this mission, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=519.76s)]
*  we learned later that the CIA had been on this mission for years, for years after 9-11, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=527.12s)]
*  to figure out everything they could about not just bin Laden, but everything related to bin Laden, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=533.2s)]
*  everyone related to bin Laden so they could figure out where he was. They've been doing that on Fordow. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=539.4399999999999s)]
*  They knew where it was, but they knew everything. They knew when the Iranians started it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=546.4799999999999s)]
*  They watched them build it. They had been on a mission for years to know everything that could [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=552.2399999999999s)]
*  be known about this place. And then they developed a plan long ago. This has been in the works, [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=558.88s)]
*  just in case, to destroy it. All right, General Cain revealing that one officer spent 15 years [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=565.04s)]
*  on this issue. He said they started building it in 2009, and this guy has basically been in a basement [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  for that entire time. And then they added a second guy to it. So these two guys have spent the last [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=580.48s)]
*  15 years on nothing other than Fordow. And not only have they been studying everything there is [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=585.76s)]
*  to know about Fordow, but they realized we were going to need a new bomb to destroy Fordow, that [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=593.28s)]
*  we didn't have that in our existing arsenal. And that is how those 30,000 pound bunker busting [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=599.44s)]
*  bombs were born. Listen. In 2009, a Defense Threat Reduction Agency officer was brought into a vault [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=606.48s)]
*  at an undisclosed location and briefed on something going on in Iran. For security purposes, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=616.48s)]
*  I'm not going to share his name. He was shown some photos and some highly classified intelligence [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=622.88s)]
*  of what looked like a major construction project in the mountains of Iran. He was tasked to study [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=628.56s)]
*  this facility, work with the intelligence community to understand it, and he was soon joined by an [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  additional teammate. For more than 15 years, this officer and his teammate lived and breathed this [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  single target, Fordow, a critical element of Iran's covert nuclear weapons program. And along the way, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=648.16s)]
*  they realized we did not have a weapon that could adequately strike and kill this target. So they [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=655.92s)]
*  began a journey to work with industry and other tacticians to develop the GBU-57. They accomplished [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=662.8s)]
*  hundreds of test shots and dropped many full-scale weapons against extremely realistic targets [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=670.16s)]
*  purpose. Kill this target at the time and place of our nation's choosing. And then, on a day in June of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=679.36s)]
*  2025, more than 15 years after they started their life's work, the phone rang and the President of [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  the United States ordered the B-2 force that you've supported to go strike and kill this target. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=694.48s)]
*  Think of it. Can you imagine that? I'd love to meet these two guys. I understand perfectly well why we can't. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=700.64s)]
*  But wouldn't you love to meet these pilots and then these guys? These guys who are like the CIA agent [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=711.92s)]
*  who found Bin Laden. They do all the preliminary work. They know this site like the back of their [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=717.68s)]
*  hands. I'm sure they worked every day to figure out exactly what it would take to destroy it. And then [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=722.08s)]
*  once they built that bomb and understood, then got the call from President Trump [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=728.08s)]
*  that we're doing it. Your site, Fordo, is now under my target. We're doing it. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=734.4000000000001s)]
*  Then those guys have got to pray. They've got to hope that the military guys who fly the B-2s [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  do it perfectly, that nothing goes wrong, that the Iranians don't detect the flights on the way in. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=751.36s)]
*  Think of it. It's crazy how much had to go right for these guys, the amount of planning and [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=757.2800000000001s)]
*  professionalism. General K next describing the stunning precision required to actually hit Fordo, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=762.08s)]
*  where it was most vulnerable, all of which they knew. This was not just a bunch of guys like, [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=769.36s)]
*  oh, we got to go bomb this very small site. They knew Fordo forward and backward, and they were [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=775.36s)]
*  very prepared to destroy it. You can see these three holes. Depicted here is the main exhaust [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=781.76s)]
*  shaft with two additional ventilation shafts on either side. The United States decided to strike [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=790.2399999999999s)]
*  these two ventilation shafts, seen here on the main graphic, as the primary point of entry [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=796.8s)]
*  into the mission space. In the days preceding the attack against Fordo, the Iranians attempted to [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=803.12s)]
*  cover the shafts with concrete to try to prevent an attack. The planners had to account for this. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=810.24s)]
*  They accounted for everything. The cap was forcibly removed by the first weapon, and the main shaft [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=818.8s)]
*  was uncovered. Weapons two, three, four, five were tasked to enter the main shaft, move down [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=826.72s)]
*  into the complex at greater than 1000 feet per second and explode in the mission space. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=836.72s)]
*  Then he talked about there was a weapon six with the flex capability, which sounded a lot like the [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=845.36s)]
*  flex capacitor and things got really exciting. But no, it's incredible. The four star general [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=849.6800000000001s)]
*  showing exactly how these bombs work, debuting stunning footage of a test shot. This isn't the [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=856.08s)]
*  actual bombing of the Iranian facility. It's a test shot the military did of a GBU-57 bomb, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=864.24s)]
*  just like the one that was used on Iran. You're watching it right now for the listening audience. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=871.12s)]
*  It's hard to explain. You should just go watch it 14 minutes after the hour on our MK [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=877.2s)]
*  YouTube feed, but it's incredible. You've got up close footage of this thing burrowing. It looks [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=883.6s)]
*  like, to me, it looks like a space shuttle that we would launch upward normally, but we're launching [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=888.96s)]
*  it straight downward, burrowing into the ground, and then it explodes when it gets down there. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=894.0s)]
*  Yeah, okay. So then there's a human element to every military operation. General Kane knew that, [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=901.6s)]
*  and as I already pointed out, he spoke to some of that, but he went on. These pilots absolutely [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=907.28s)]
*  risked their lives to protect this country. There was a time in which we wouldn't have had to be [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=914.24s)]
*  reminded of this by the secretary of defense, by the chairman of the joint chiefs. There was a [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=918.16s)]
*  time in which we would have understood and inherently recognized and paid homage to the [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=923.84s)]
*  emotional strain that this type of mission creates on those who execute it and on their families. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=928.4s)]
*  We used to be quick to praise the heroes of our military, especially in effectively never before [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=936.48s)]
*  attempted missions like this one, and General Kane took that on earlier today, too. Watch. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=942.72s)]
*  When the crews went to work on Friday, they kissed their loved ones goodbye, [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=948.72s)]
*  not knowing when or if they'd be home. Late on Saturday night, their families became aware [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=952.72s)]
*  of what was happening, and on Sunday, when those jets returned from Whiteman, their families were [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=960.0s)]
*  there. Flags flying and tears flowing. I have chills literally talking about this. The jets rejoined [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=966.72s)]
*  into a formation of four airplanes followed by a formation of three and came up overhead Whiteman [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=974.4s)]
*  proudly in the traffic pattern, pitching out to land right over the base and landing to the [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=981.28s)]
*  incredible cheers of their families who sacrifice and serve right alongside their family members. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=987.28s)]
*  Like I said, there were a lot of flags and a lot of tears. One commander told me this is a moment [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=995.12s)]
*  in the lives of our families that they will never forget. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1001.12s)]
*  It's incredible. I have chills just thinking about it. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1006.4s)]
*  General Kane is an F-16 pilot himself, by the way. All I could think of when he was talking about it [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1010.48s)]
*  was this video that was circulating on X over the weekend. I think this is Blue Angels down in [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1015.84s)]
*  Florida. It's not these guys, but the scene as he described it reminded me of this, and I'll bet you [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1020.16s)]
*  those pilots saw something like this when they flew back home to Missouri. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1027.44s)]
*  I think it's the Blue Angels flying overhead in a similar formation. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1045.3600000000001s)]
*  Of course, Thunderstruck playing in the background was just one of the greatest [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1052.48s)]
*  songs ever made. It's so impressive. It's something to be honored. I really don't care [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1056.56s)]
*  how you feel about the Iranian mission. I mean, the mission to take out the Iranian nuclear sites, [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1064.1599999999999s)]
*  as I made clear, I'm in favor of it, but I don't care. You can support our military and the [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1069.76s)]
*  incredible feat they accomplished no matter how you feel. So this is one of the things that [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1074.32s)]
*  Pete and General Kane were saying. Could you just pause for two minutes? Could you give us [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1081.04s)]
*  two days trying to process what happened, trying to get a handle on how it went? [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1087.52s)]
*  General Kane said, that doesn't come from me. What exactly we destroyed. He said we don't [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1093.6s)]
*  grade our own homework. But Pete's saying, just calm down and give us a beat, and we will bring [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1098.1599999999999s)]
*  you the results just like we're doing this morning. But instead, you need Natasha Bertrand [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1105.76s)]
*  to have a leak from some Trump hater of low confidence, not identified as such, reporting [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1110.24s)]
*  that it was a failure, that nothing was destroyed, and that it's only been set back by a month or two. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1118.88s)]
*  It's not true that now we've had reports from the Israeli intelligence. We've had reports from the [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1126.4s)]
*  IAEA. The IAEA is out there saying the sites have been destroyed. The director of the IAEA, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1133.6s)]
*  Rafael Grassi, said specifically, not just the entrance. This is one of the reports, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1139.6s)]
*  maybe they just got the entrance to the Fordo facility, the exit. He said, no, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1146.08s)]
*  the centrifuges at Fordo where they are doing the enrichment of the uranium are no longer [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1151.4399999999998s)]
*  operational. I mean, what more do you need to hear? So the press, having been subjected to this [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1159.28s)]
*  appropriate lecture from these two, absolutely remained clueless and got absolutely nothing [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1166.56s)]
*  of what had just been communicated to them, and instead thought this would be the moment to whine [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1173.52s)]
*  again to Secretary Hegseth about why he called the pilots boys when one of them was female. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  Why not acknowledge the female pilots that also participated in this mission? The early messages [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  that you sent out only congratulated the boys. So when I say something like boys and bombers, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1195.84s)]
*  see, this is the kind of thing the press does, right? Of course, the chairman mentioned [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1201.04s)]
*  a female bomber pilot. That's fantastic. She's fantastic. She's a hero. I want more female [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1204.56s)]
*  bomber pilots. I hope the men and women of our country sign up to do such brave and audacious [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1209.04s)]
*  things. But when you spin it as because I say our boys and bombers as a common phrase, I'll keep [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1213.1999999999998s)]
*  saying things like that, whether they're men or women, very proud of that female pilot, just like [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1218.56s)]
*  I'm very proud of those male pilots. And I don't care if it's a male or a female in that cockpit, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1223.04s)]
*  and the American people don't care. But it's the obsession with race and gender in this department [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1228.32s)]
*  that's changed priorities. We don't do that anymore. We don't play your little games. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1235.12s)]
*  Right on. Well handled like a boss. Secretary Hegseth also lashing out at Fox News is Jennifer [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1239.84s)]
*  Griffin, who on Sunday posted on X about there being a female pilot. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1247.44s)]
*  It's an expression our boys, I guarantee you, I was the only female lawyer in my Chicago law firm [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1254.16s)]
*  when I what kind of a moron would take offense to the generic reference of our boys? We get it. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1260.0800000000002s)]
*  All right. Only the most thin skinned, sensitive women would be like, oh, and I guarantee you the [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1267.76s)]
*  most thin skinned, sensitive women don't become B2 bomber pilots. This is an absurdity. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1273.12s)]
*  But she was one of the ones to quickly call him out for using the term boys in the bombers. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1280.56s)]
*  And Hegseth and she had an exchange this morning. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1286.2399999999998s)]
*  Do you have certainty that all the highly enriched uranium was inside the Fordow Mountain or some of [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1289.36s)]
*  it, because there were satellite photos that showed more than a dozen trucks there two days [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1296.8s)]
*  in advance, are you certain none of that highly enriched uranium was moved? Of course, we're [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1301.44s)]
*  watching every single aspect. But Jennifer, you've been about the worst. The one who misrepresents [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1305.92s)]
*  the most intentionally what the president says. I'm familiar. I was the first to report about [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1311.92s)]
*  the ventilation shafts on Saturday night. And in fact, I was the first to describe the B2 bombers, [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1317.8400000000001s)]
*  the refueling, the entire mission with great accuracy. So I take issue with that. I appreciate [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1325.04s)]
*  you acknowledging that this is the first operate the most successful mission based on operational [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1330.88s)]
*  security that this department has done since you've been here. And I appreciate that. So [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1337.44s)]

*  I mean, I like Jennifer, but he's not wrong that she's had a definite and detectable bias against [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1347.7600000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump. If you look at her reporting, that's just it's obvious. Again, I really like her and I [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1352.88s)]
*  respect what she's been through as a reporter and a woman. But I don't I see why he's angry. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1358.72s)]
*  And you heard her there defending her reporting here now to react to all of this. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1364.4s)]
*  The fellas are back. Josh Holmes, Michael Duncan, John Ashbrook and comfortably smug, [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1368.96s)]

*  just show them that this country loves them and is proud of them, notwithstanding [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1536.48s)]

*  but I'll just give you one example. So right just today, today now she's reporting because, [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1549.28s)]
*  you know, Trump yesterday was like, I'm not sure we need an agreement with Iran. Like, [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1553.52s)]
*  I guess we could put something in writing that we're going to like inspect, but we blew up their [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1558.56s)]
*  their nuclear facilities and Trump's kind of like, and I guess maybe we'll just have to blow up more. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1564.08s)]
*  I don't feel like it's done. He's like, it's destroyed. So I guess we could put something [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1569.28s)]
*  in writing. He says, I don't care if we have an agreement or not. And then of course, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1574.16s)]
*  Jennifer Griffin comes out and says, actually, every US and Israeli expert who has studied the [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1577.2s)]
*  Iranian nuclear program tells me that without the agreement and inspectors on the ground, [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1582.72s)]
*  the Iranian regime, which while definitely hurt, survived the humilitating military strikes, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1586.88s)]
*  humiliating military strikes on its key nuclear sites and its ballistic middle infrastructure [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1593.04s)]
*  missile, will return to pursuing nuclear enrichment. You can't bomb the knowledge. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1596.8s)]
*  There's no way to bomb Iran's nuclear ambitions. The military is a tool to set the program back in [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1602.48s)]
*  order to then negotiate. But you know, I have to say, guys, it seems to me that our ability to know [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1608.24s)]
*  what was happening at Fordo was pretty good. And it seems to have largely come from our Intel, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1614.8s)]
*  the Israeli Intel satellite images, and probably not exactly the IAEA inspections that Iran had to [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1623.84s)]
*  allow. I mean, I'm sure it was a combo, but like, my point is simply, we seem to have known Fordo [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1632.88s)]
*  the way your GYN knows your ovaries. And that's a good thing. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1639.2800000000002s)]
*  I don't quite know how to react to that. I presume that you're probably- [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1646.4s)]
*  Oh, more can be said. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1652.48s)]
*  It is like an ovary. It says that you don't actually have the ability to lay hands on it [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1656.96s)]
*  every day, but you can check it out and keep an eye on it and make sure its general health is [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1661.04s)]
*  where you want it to be. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  Okay. Okay. I think that's a fair assessment. Well, I don't want to continue the parallel here. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1668.32s)]
*  But look, if you think about the way that the press has just entered into this conversation [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1676.8s)]
*  with casting doubt and using this low confidence Intel assessment to basically suggest that this [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1684.32s)]
*  mission was a failure, which is ridiculous. It's also illogical in that the stated mission [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1689.92s)]
*  from Donald Trump over and over and over again, and then after over and over and over again, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1697.2s)]
*  was to render these nuclear sites inoperable. That's what it was. Now, unless you didn't pay [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1702.3200000000002s)]
*  attention to the news for the last 10 days, the Israeli Air Force was basically doing an Oshkosh [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1708.8000000000002s)]
*  air show over Tehran. It wasn't a lot of opportunity to just sort of like one shot and done. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1713.68s)]
*  I mean, if they didn't get the job done, does anybody really think that Donald Trump, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1720.48s)]
*  Pete Hegseth and our brave men and women in uniform wouldn't get that job done? Or moreover, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1726.88s)]
*  that somehow Natasha Bertrand has a better handle on whether or not they're enriching uranium still [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1732.72s)]
*  than our United States military that mapped out, as you say, the ovaries of the nuclear facility. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1739.28s)]
*  You know, I mean, that's just the logical piece of this that makes no sense. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1746.32s)]
*  Here's the other thing. The initial report was like, oh, they collapsed the entrance to [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1751.76s)]
*  Fordo. That's basically it. Meanwhile, you hear General Cain talking about how we all the number [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1756.6399999999999s)]
*  of bombs we had, but these burrowing bombs that again, just picture like a rocket that we watch [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1762.3999999999999s)]
*  launch only facing down, going down into the earth and that the precision drops of each into each [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1767.36s)]
*  ventilation shaft that was on either side of the centrifuges doing the enrichment. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1774.24s)]
*  And the reason was because you can get down in those ventilation shafts. Here's this. This is from [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1781.04s)]
*  the test video that they showed us. This isn't the actual, but supposedly it looks like what it [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1786.8799999999999s)]
*  looked like. So they go down into those two ventilation shafts on either end and then [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1790.6399999999999s)]
*  dropped like a thousand pounds, whatever. These are 30,000 pound bombs and caused a huge explosion [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1795.2s)]
*  in the presser. They talked about how the pilots talked about it was pitch dark and then it lit up [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1804.0s)]
*  like the daytime, possibly because they hit a uranium centrifuge. And now they want us to [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1810.64s)]
*  believe like, oh, they basically knocked down a screen door with their [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1817.44s)]
*  own hands. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1820.64s)]
*  Well, and back to Holmes's point on the whole common sense of this, do you think like if Donald [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1825.0400000000002s)]
*  Trump wasn't super confident that he got what he needed to out of these strikes, do you think he [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1829.5200000000002s)]
*  would have been calling for a ceasefire and getting the Iranians and the Israelis to the table the [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1833.76s)]
*  next day? That's the mission. That was the point of the mission. If it didn't succeed and they were [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1837.8400000000001s)]
*  basically doing whatever the heck they wanted over Tehran for a calendar week, they would, of course, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1842.4s)]
*  would have gotten the job done. I mean, it's just, yes, it defied. Trump said that Trump went in his [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1848.08s)]
*  thing about the agreement when he's like, I don't think we need an agreement. He says, you know, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1852.0s)]
*  I told Marco, like, should we have an agreement? He goes, because I think they'll do whatever we [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1856.0s)]
*  want them to do. Like, right. He's like, right now, they're going to sign whatever the hell we want [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1860.8799999999999s)]
*  to resign so they don't see our B-2 bombers again anytime soon. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, look, fire up [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1865.04s)]
*  the ACDC, fire up Freebird. We got America back on top of the world right now. You see it, you know, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1872.8799999999999s)]
*  Trump goes over to NATO and what a difference eight years makes, right? They're like making fun of [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1879.28s)]
*  them eight years ago. Now they're like, oh, you wanted 2%. How about 5? How about 5% of our GDP? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1885.04s)]
*  What else do you need? To me, that's the most stunning thing of seeing the press reaction, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1890.24s)]
*  especially from people like Natasha Bertrand, is we are so incredibly fortunate. President Trump [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1894.24s)]
*  saw this window of opportunity where Israel had degraded so many of Iran's proxies all around that [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1899.76s)]
*  region and America had already bombed the Houthis. And so you have a window of opportunity for this [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1906.8s)]
*  problem, this thorn in our side, which could eventually get to the point where Iran has a [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1913.6s)]
*  nuclear bomb and he has the foresight and knows there's so much chatter out there online of like, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1918.24s)]
*  oh no, this is going to be a forever war. This is going to be 20 years of boots on the ground. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1925.52s)]
*  And he's willing to do the right thing. Precision strike, which takes care of the problem. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1930.08s)]
*  Americans should be celebrating. Wow. Universally celebrating. How lucky are we? [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1935.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. The only group of people trying to take America down a peg right now is the press. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1941.4399999999998s)]
*  I mean, Pete Hegseth had the temerity to say thank you to our boys in the air. And they're like, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1946.4799999999998s)]
*  wait a minute, you didn't mention women. You played this clip. They asked him about it again today. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1951.76s)]
*  And it's an issue that I think deserves some examination. You know, our good friend, [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1956.64s)]
*  Josh Holmes pointed out earlier this week that if you look throughout history, like it's Cindy [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1961.12s)]
*  Lauper's famous song, girls just want to have fun. Well, the truth of the matter is boys want to have [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1966.8s)]
*  fun too. So you need to go back through everything in history and even things out if you're going to [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1971.68s)]
*  start doing it right now in America. So true. The nerve of Cindy Lauper, who knew she was such a [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1977.6s)]
*  sexist pig. It's like this exclusionary language must stop. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1982.72s)]
*  By the way, we looked it up. The Washington Times is reporting that the woman who asked that totally [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1990.8s)]
*  inane question was Associated Press reporter, reporter Tara Copp, Tara, C-O-P-P. If so, she [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=1997.04s)]
*  ought to be ashamed of herself. If not, we'll correct it after we find out if we're wrong. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2005.52s)]
*  I don't think we're wrong. It tracks. It's so bizarre. The whole thing. It's like, [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2012.72s)]
*  you have this incredible mission, this absolute success. Presidents from the 90s were talking [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2017.76s)]
*  about how you go about dealing with nuclear ambitions in Iran. We end up with a successful [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2025.52s)]
*  strike and they're like, Mr. Secretary, were there trans capabilities in B2s? Like, we got to make [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2030.72s)]
*  sure that everyone feels comfortable and allowed to bomb. That's exactly right. Was there a non [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2040.48s)]
*  binary bomber? If so, I can't, if not, I can't get behind this. There's so much more to talk about [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2049.84s)]
*  here. So I want to spend a minute on the media. Laura Coats of CNN did like a whole hour earlier [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2055.84s)]
*  this week on how this was a failure. Here's a sampling. Just how effective were the American [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2061.04s)]
*  strikes on Iran's nuclear program? Well, tonight CNN is learning a preliminary intelligence [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2067.44s)]
*  assessment suggests they did not destroy Iran's nuclear sites. This early report is from the [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2072.7200000000003s)]
*  Pentagon's Defense Intelligence Agency. CNN has spoken with seven people briefed on it. One [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2079.2000000000003s)]
*  source says that the strike set Iran back, quote, maybe a few months tops. Two others tell us the [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2085.76s)]
*  country stockpile of enriched uranium was also not destroyed. Another says the centrifuges are [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2093.12s)]
*  largely intact. Really? Because the director of the IAEA is now on record saying the centrifuges [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2098.96s)]
*  are no longer operational. The CIA and every other intelligence agency to look at this, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2108.4s)]
*  including the Israelis say it's been destroyed and it will take years for them to rebuild anything. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2114.08s)]
*  So I look forward to their correction. What's happening instead is you had Trump take aim, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2120.4s)]
*  in particular at CNN, because they hired this dishonest Natasha Bertrand. That's my opinion. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2126.96s)]
*  She's actually not just bad, dishonest. They hired her and Trump says she should be fired. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2133.04s)]
*  I agree. She shouldn't be hired. The fact that she has a job at all after her disastrous fake [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2138.88s)]
*  news reporting for years at Politico and Business Insider and for the Atlantic is a miracle. I mean, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2145.2s)]
*  it's a travesty. So he says she should be fired. This is a ridiculous thing that she's out there [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2151.6s)]
*  still doing this to me. And then you get, wait for it, Jake Tapper to swoop in and provide a lecture [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2156.3199999999997s)]
*  to the president on what the proper role of a journalist is. I think we have it. Let's watch. [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2164.7999999999997s)]
*  We don't know yet whether this administration is accurately portraying what happened in Iran [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2170.56s)]
*  or not. We don't know. That's the point of publishing what we know that the government [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2176.48s)]
*  learns once we learn it. The lessons there, the news media needs to press for facts, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2183.12s)]
*  even if it's uncomfortable, even if as Americans and as humans, there is a personal instinct [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2188.16s)]
*  to rally around the flag. Asking questions is literally our job. Demanding facts and answers [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2194.72s)]
*  instead of just taking a president's word for it. History has taught us that the most pro [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2201.04s)]
*  service member action we can take is to ask questions of our leaders, especially in times [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2209.2s)]
*  of war. That for journalists is the height of patriotism. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2216.24s)]
*  Oh, he's still going. My head hurts. We have an obligation to ask questions of our presidents [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2221.4399999999996s)]
*  and not just take their word. We know. Yeah, we know. We just spent four years covering for [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2228.64s)]
*  an invalid. I wonder what was different about him. Maybe it was because he's a Democrat. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2234.7999999999997s)]
*  I would say, Megan, though, it was nice to see that Jake has now regained control of his faculties [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2239.04s)]
*  after the beat down that you administered during his book tour. My God, that was incredible. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2244.08s)]
*  That's the only time I've ever felt really sorry for him ever in my life. No, he deserved it. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  He said he wanted a beat down. So he said he was looking forward to the exchange. And then I think [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2255.12s)]
*  it went as we expected. It was kind of you to oblige. Okay. So they're all upset at CNN [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2262.72s)]
*  that their star reporter is now coming under fire. Let me just give you a sample. I know you [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2271.28s)]
*  guys know, but like the audience, because no one's ever heard of this woman, Natasha Bertrand. I can't [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2275.84s)]
*  even get her name straight. She's very young. She is fucking clueless. Honestly, she has no idea [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2280.0800000000004s)]
*  how not to be used as a stenographer for Intel forces that have an agenda. These are the least [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2286.6400000000003s)]
*  trustworthy people on the planet. Like their leaks to you require the most scrutiny, doubt, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2294.0s)]
*  and tire kicking of any leak you'll ever get. But instead, her only test seems to have been, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2303.92s)]
*  does this help or hurt Trump? Hurt? I'll go with it. Let's do that. Here's just a sampling of her [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2309.92s)]
*  over the past couple of years. If you take, for example, the Steele dossier at kind of face value, [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2315.6800000000003s)]
*  or you take that as any kind of guide, there was a lot of internal dissent within the Russian [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2320.56s)]
*  government about whether or not and to what extent the Russians should interfere in the U.S. election [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2325.44s)]
*  and coordinate with Donald Trump. Trump said, Russia, if you're listening, it almost seemed like [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2331.6s)]
*  a signal. Intelligence experts have been telling me that it seemed like at that moment Trump was [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2336.96s)]
*  signaling to the Russians that it was okay for them to do that and implicitly giving them his [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2341.12s)]
*  permission to do that. That it makes it much more plausible that Trump did go to Russia and he did [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2347.12s)]
*  have these kinds of sexual escapades with prostitutes. I know Trump has been traveling to Moscow [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2351.52s)]
*  for quite some time and it just makes it all the more plausible that what the dossier says he did [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2356.7999999999997s)]
*  actually did occur. What if Donald Trump actually knew beforehand that the Russians planned to do [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2361.7599999999998s)]
*  this and was kind of giving them a signal to proceed? Because former intelligence officials [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2366.16s)]
*  that I spoke to said that this might have been, in fact, a signal to the Russians to give them kind [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2371.3599999999997s)]
*  of political cover in order to hack into Clinton's emails. All right, Natasha, thanks so much. You've [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2375.76s)]
*  covered this so closely and it shows. First class reporting. We could have been here all day with [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2381.0400000000004s)]
*  soundbites from her just like this. You guys know Eric Wemple, right, at the Washington Post. He's [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2390.0800000000004s)]
*  a media critic and he's unsparing and he, to his credit, will be unsparing even of left-wing [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2395.6000000000004s)]
*  reporters. He went off on this woman in February of 2020. I'm just going to give you a couple of [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2401.68s)]
*  samples, okay? He started by recounting a hit that she was doing on MSNBC because she used to be an [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2410.24s)]
*  MSNBC contributor. Now she's over at CNN and he talks about how she went on Joy Reid's show and [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2420.3199999999997s)]
*  they turned to Natasha on whether Trump wanted Russian meddling or whether he just can't accept [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2427.68s)]
*  that foreign help is there. Natasha responded, we don't have the reporting that suggests the [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2434.24s)]
*  president has told aides, for example, that he really wants Russia to interfere because he thinks [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2439.68s)]
*  that it's going to help him, right? Eric Wemple goes on, no, we don't have that reporting, though [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2444.08s)]
*  there's no prohibition against fantasizing about it on national television, such as the theme of [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2450.56s)]
*  Bertrand's commentary during previous coverage of Russian interference, specifically the Steele [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2456.56s)]
*  dossier. Bertrand helped or heaped credibility on the dossier, which was published and followed by [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2462.56s)]
*  Buzzfeed in January of 17, in repeated television appearances. Her written work has appeared on [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2469.36s)]
*  Business Insider, the Atlantic, Politico, where she's now a national security correspondent. She [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2474.56s)]
*  was at Politico before CNN too. Along the way, she bootstrapped her punditry into a contributor's [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2478.4s)]
*  role in MSNBC. Her boosterism for these lies dates back years and he goes on about how she got the [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2483.28s)]
*  Paul Manafort story wrong. She kept going on the air to play up every piece of the fake Russia gate [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2490.7200000000003s)]
*  reporting in the most uncharitable way towards Trump possible. He says her highlight reel [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2497.52s)]
*  features a great deal of thumb on the scale speculation regarding the dossier. And if I [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2504.56s)]
*  read you all the highlights, we'd be here all day. But let's just suffice it to say that she [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2510.7999999999997s)]
*  never saw a negative piece of information from the Intel community about Trump she didn't like. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2516.56s)]
*  And she's the one who printed, who broke the big news in Politico about the 51 intelligence agents [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2521.92s)]
*  who say the Hunter Biden laptop is Russian disinformation. This is the woman who just [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2530.32s)]
*  took a massive dump on those B2 pilots because she decided to run with nothing was destroyed [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2536.8s)]
*  except for the screen door. And without telling the audience, it was low confidence. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2545.52s)]
*  So Natasha Bertrand has a very long and storied history of trafficking in just not only lies, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2551.04s)]
*  but figments of her own imagination. I think there were rumors that heard from other journalists [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2559.36s)]
*  that the reason why she hops from publication to publication is because editors eventually get sick [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2564.1600000000003s)]
*  of having to deal with covering for what are out and out lies. Sort of a Taylor Lorenz issue. Yeah, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2569.52s)]
*  so she has to keep hopping around to publications. And further, I've heard from Democrats that she's [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2575.28s)]
*  the easiest way to place anything you want and get it out there. Of course. And she has built her [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2580.8s)]
*  career off of these TV hits where she basically says whatever any kind of like loony tune resistance [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2586.16s)]
*  you know, wine mom wants to hear. They want to be told you're not crazy lady. It's not you know, [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2592.48s)]
*  you're fat and your brain worms. Actually, Trump is a Russian agent this whole time. Believe me. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2597.9199999999996s)]
*  Now let's spill the Chablis. Have an afternoon. Her entire career is based off of just feeding [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2603.52s)]
*  into that madness and telling insane people you're not the crazy one. And she's gotten way with it [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2608.8799999999997s)]
*  for so long. I cannot wait for it to finally catch up with her. I mean, I have to ask like, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2613.52s)]
*  I don't know if they're lies. I don't know what they are. But how is she wrong so often and always [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2617.92s)]
*  in one direction? You know, is she this naive? Because when if you're going to cover this beat, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2623.84s)]
*  you know, Intel, the Pentagon, I'm sorry, but like you need a Catherine Harridge. You know, you need [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2629.04s)]
*  like a motherfucker who will like be all over you. She won't believe a word you say. She dislikes [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2634.88s)]
*  everyone. Like that's what you need. It works. It works. You can't have this doe-eyed, know nothing [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2641.2s)]
*  reporter who just gets used as tool, a stooge of these Intel agents who are far smarter than she is. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2648.8799999999997s)]
*  So I don't know if these are lies or just she's fine being used and made to look like a fool [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2656.48s)]
*  in every report she does smug. I don't know. Yeah, I don't I don't know if they're lies, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2663.8399999999997s)]
*  Megan. I think what it is is to the it's wish casting, like whatever is the least charitable, [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2669.12s)]
*  you know, fact that the deep state can spin to her, she's going to accept it at face value [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2674.48s)]
*  because she wants it to be true. So badly. The other thing that really comes to mind in all of [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2679.44s)]
*  this, you know, with reporters like that talking about how, oh, well, we didn't actually, you know, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2683.68s)]
*  take out the nuclear sites. Like it's it's their their instinct to sort of root against Trump. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2688.16s)]
*  And it reminds me so much of those like early months of COVID, where you got this whole sort [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2694.0s)]
*  of strain of journalism that seemed like it was almost rooting for the virus. You know, yes. Yep. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2698.64s)]
*  Big inroads in Manhattan this afternoon. No, it's true. It's true. But I think the Intel thing. Look, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2704.16s)]
*  this is a fairly recent phenomenon in the it's in the era of Trump, where we've sort of become more [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2709.7599999999998s)]
*  skeptical of what the deep state is producing. And there's just cabal that's been it's not new. But [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2715.04s)]
*  now we know about it. That part is new of like the Brennan's and the Clappers and their acolytes [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2721.68s)]
*  that sort of live within this apparatus. And people like Natasha Bertrand, are their exclusive [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2726.72s)]
*  way out to just sort of undermine the larger mission of the country and the president and [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2733.8399999999997s)]
*  everything else. But they do this very tricky thing. And you could hear in the clips that you [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2738.48s)]
*  played of her doing just this, which is making an assertion that is like blindly insane, [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2742.72s)]
*  totally unsupported by facts. And then she drops a comma and says, Intel officials say, [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2750.0s)]
*  Yep, right. Yeah. Intel official unidentified is likely one of these, you know, somebody who picks [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2756.0s)]
*  up Brennan's coffee in the morning. But but that's the way that she can traffic the information to [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2762.64s)]
*  the American people. This has been happening for decades. It's only in the era of Trump that we've [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2767.92s)]
*  become aware of it. And what you have is, like in that example, Jake Tapper trying to spin this is [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2772.96s)]
*  like some glorious, noble effort at reporting by leaking a preliminary low confidence report, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2779.92s)]
*  which she did not tell the audience was low confidence in her initial reporting, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2788.8s)]
*  neither CNN nor the New York Times thought that would be relevant at all. And I read you the [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2793.44s)]
*  Catherine Harridge explanation of how a normal schooled Pentagon or Intel reporter would receive [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2798.8s)]
*  such a leak, they would be like, this is not worth the paper it's printed on. It's it that's, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2806.32s)]
*  but what they do is when Pete Hegseth comes out and says, just stop, that was low confidence, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2811.76s)]
*  and it was preliminary, all their instincts are we're being lied to. We're being spun. We're [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2816.6400000000003s)]
*  being spun as opposed to what if he's telling the truth? What if you know, when Tulsi Gabbard [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2822.2400000000002s)]
*  comes out, which she just did too, and said it was that the facilities were destroyed. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2827.1200000000003s)]
*  The CIA, John Radcliffe comes out and says, you know, I can't remember his phrase, but it was [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2832.7200000000003s)]
*  basically massive damage at all of them and devastating. The IAEA guy saying, now let's get [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2836.6400000000003s)]
*  more specific, the centrifuges are no longer operational. And he went on to describe the mass [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2841.92s)]
*  what if they're telling us the truth? What if they're not all just engaged in a massive coverup [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2848.1600000000003s)]
*  operation, but our pilots actually did get it done? How is it you can't even allow for that? [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2852.5600000000004s)]
*  Right. And if you go back to the first clip you played, what was the one thing she was willing [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2859.2s)]
*  to take at face value? The Steele dossier. I wasn't going to question that. A lot of good reasons to [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2864.64s)]
*  believe that, but it's not, it's not just her, you know, it's not just her. There's an editorial [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2870.8799999999997s)]
*  process that falls apart when they don't include that this is a low confident preliminary early [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2877.3599999999997s)]
*  report. And also by the way, the CIA says, and also other intelligence sources say, and the way [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2883.76s)]
*  that they frame it is that this is the fact. And then here's a quote from Pete Hegsith who worked [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2890.6400000000003s)]
*  at Fox news and therefore not credible. And then here's more conjecture from blind sources [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2896.6400000000003s)]
*  that we're not even quoting. We're just paraphrasing our interpretation of what it is [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2902.0800000000004s)]
*  they're claiming. Well said. And the Israelis feel pretty confident that these facilities were [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2906.4s)]
*  destroyed. And like, I don't know, not for nothing, but Mossad and these Israelis can put a missile [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2911.6s)]
*  into an apartment bedroom to kill a guy in Tehran. I think they're pretty well sourced and not to, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2917.52s)]
*  and not to mention, I mean, like they're the most under attack. And Duncan, I don't think it's from [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2923.44s)]
*  the IAEA inspections that they knew where those guys were living and how to murder them. Keep going. [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2926.96s)]
*  And then the other side of it is like, they're the most under threat. Like they have all the [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2933.44s)]
*  incentive of the world to be like, ah, I think maybe we did 50% of the job that you should go [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2937.2799999999997s)]
*  back in there. But if they're confident in it, then we should be pretty confident. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2940.88s)]
*  That's why it's more pernicious than anything. And that what they're assuming by saying this story [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2944.08s)]
*  is that basically Donald Trump is going to try to put our men and women in uniform in harm's way [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2949.12s)]
*  for something that didn't get done and then throw a bumper sticker and say it got done. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2954.56s)]
*  It's insane. It literally defies imagination. And as Judge Judy says, if it doesn't make any sense, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2958.96s)]
*  it isn't true. Okay, stand by. There's much more to discuss. We've got to get over the [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2967.52s)]
*  the bromance between Trump and the UN secretary general. It was all like anything we've ever seen [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2972.48s)]
*  before. NATO hates us. NATO's secretary general. NATO hates us. And yet no longer. Now we're VFFs. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2977.12s)]
*  It was an extraordinary turnabout. We'll talk about it next. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2984.88s)]
*  You know that moment at night when you're locking up, you're turning off the lights [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=2990.72s)]

*  spotlights on them. And they can call the police. This is so great. It's a proactive way of deterring [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3024.16s)]

*  of the following exclusive trailer. You know, we've been doing, we've been getting into the [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3084.32s)]
*  parody business here on the MK show. We had some fun at Meghan Markle's expense and we had some [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3089.68s)]
*  fun at the expense of the ladies from blue origin when we did our own blonde origin and our latest [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3096.56s)]
*  target as you will see in this little trailer for tomorrow's bigger piece is Michelle Obama. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3103.76s)]
*  A former first lady with her own podcast. I'm Michelle Obama. People line up for my advice. [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3115.2000000000003s)]
*  No, not her. This former first lady. I'm Megan Oh, people need to hear from me. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3124.48s)]
*  Many people don't understand. Not much is covered in the White House. It's expensive to live in the [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3133.44s)]
*  White House. We made it through. We got out alive. But what happened to me? What happened to me? [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3138.88s)]
*  No one talks about it. No, they don't. With advice that will inspire. Do you know what having children [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3145.68s)]
*  does to your life? It ruins it. They mess you up. It's about misery. Folks think that this is harsh. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3152.56s)]
*  It's like you're going to have a bad decade. We don't articulate our pain. Yes. Meet Megan Oh, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3160.48s)]
*  Friday on the Megan Kelly show. I love that stuff. Yeah, I love the deadpan. We don't talk about that. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3167.92s)]
*  Nobody ever talks about that. Maureen is my sister on the podcast. She has her brother with her. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3181.84s)]
*  All he does is kiss her ass and get told how wrong he is on everything he says. [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3189.28s)]
*  Anyway, we had so much fun doing this because it's like basically we're doing the things that [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3194.72s)]
*  Saturday Night Live should do. We're targeting the people who should be subjected to scorn and [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3200.32s)]
*  ridicule, but the left won't touch because they're too revered. For some reason, Megan [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3206.48s)]
*  Markle is in that category. Michelle Obama, obviously. The ladies of Blue Origin. Everyone's [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3213.12s)]
*  too afraid of Jeff Bezos to touch the Lauren Sanchez thing. We've been having such a good time [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3218.24s)]
*  just saying what's obvious about that. Michelle, she should change her name to Misery Obama. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3224.64s)]
*  That's really what I think of when I say Misery Obama never has a positive word to say. Never, [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3229.44s)]
*  never. Not about children, not about family, certainly not about her husband. By the way, [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3235.44s)]
*  before we leave this topic, here's her latest sound bite that made the rounds. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3239.76s)]
*  This happened on June 18th, but I was off. Here it is, SOT 39. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3243.28s)]
*  You should have threw a boy in the mix. I would. I'm so glad I didn't have a boy. [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3247.0400000000004s)]
*  He would have been a Barack Obama. The baby Barack. It would have been amazing. [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3253.36s)]
*  No, I would have felt for him. She just borrowed our boys. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3259.2000000000003s)]
*  Oh, wow. You catch that? She's glad she didn't have a boy because he would have been a Barack [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3262.48s)]
*  Obama. And that's a hard pass for her. This woman can't stand him. She can't. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3271.92s)]
*  Wait a minute. Now I like her. She prevented another Barack in the world. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3276.88s)]
*  The Iranian regime quakes. We could have had another shot. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3283.2s)]
*  Now, wait, speaking of Barack Obama, he decided to drop a post on X today. And I thought, OK, [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3289.6s)]
*  maybe in the wake of the Pete Hegseth presser, he's going to say something like, no matter how [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3296.8799999999997s)]
*  you feel about the Iranian strike, hats off to our boys in blue, our guys in the bombers. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3301.9199999999996s)]
*  He went a different way. This is what it was. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3308.64s)]
*  I'm curious how you're thinking about this eulogy specifically in the moment and all the [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3311.04s)]
*  tensions that you just brought up. I didn't even want to talk. I was so mad. Part of the reason [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3315.36s)]
*  I think I ended up having anything to say at that moment was when I heard some of the victims' [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3320.32s)]
*  families forgive the shooting. And I thought, all right, let's see if maybe this is a way, [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3330.08s)]
*  America can hear me at this moment. Go back to that day 10 years ago, what I think binds it [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3340.16s)]
*  together, all these different strands, case upholding health care, a case declaring same [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3347.04s)]
*  sex marriage part of our constitutional protections of mourning. I think what pulls it all together is [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3353.7599999999998s)]
*  that no one person did any of that. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3362.16s)]
*  So he's sitting around on a June Thursday thinking about himself and his glory days. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3365.84s)]
*  And to your point, Smug, I'm starting to warm up to Michelle Obama's POV. I mean, like, [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3378.4s)]
*  what is he doing? That's really something, you know, a lot of people can try to be critical of [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3383.6000000000004s)]
*  President George W. Bush, but he said numerous times that upon leaving the White House, [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3391.36s)]
*  he saw it as not a respect that wasn't even given to him of leave with grace. The job is someone [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3397.76s)]
*  else's now. Yeah. And like the kind of thing you do when you respect your country. Yeah. And then [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3405.2000000000003s)]
*  you've got the first off Michelle Obama being like, you don't understand how tough it was. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3410.32s)]
*  Hats off to the production team, though, at the Megyn Kelly show. I've seen some numbers [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3417.04s)]
*  and I think your production team actually may have doubled the total audience of the [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3421.28s)]
*  Michelle Obama podcast. Last time I saw they had like just the most atrocious numbers. I mean, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3425.36s)]
*  I guess I thought it was just because everyone's done with the Obamas that doesn't want to hear [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3432.96s)]
*  about them. But like, even if you were the kind of person who's like, I really care what Michelle [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3437.36s)]
*  Obama thinks. And then she's like, it was tough. We barely survived living in the White House. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3442.0s)]
*  We got out alive. I have a conspiracy theory on this, Megan, and that is Michelle Obama is [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3447.12s)]
*  probably getting really tired of people being like, you should run like you should be a politician. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3454.16s)]
*  She's like, I'm going to disabuse you. Yeah. I'm going to make myself as unlikable as possible. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3458.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah. People stop asking. Misery Obama does not want to run for office. Misery just wants to sit [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3463.3599999999997s)]
*  and talk about how miserable she is. And honestly, when you see the full parody tomorrow, you'll laugh. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3469.04s)]
*  Even I started bursting out laughing a couple of times because it seems impossible. It seems like [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3473.76s)]
*  I'm being too mean. But then we've intersplicethe actual Michelle Obama saying these exact things. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3477.52s)]
*  Like we didn't have to make it up. I'd like to see the outtakes of that whole thing too, Megan. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3483.2000000000003s)]
*  I think that's a good idea, Holmes. It's going to be great. Let me try to put that together for you [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3489.1200000000003s)]
*  on request. I will speak to the production team because the fellas have good ideas. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3494.88s)]
*  Okay. So that's by the way, Bill Clinton too, he had time to tweet out about June 19th or Juneteenth. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3499.68s)]
*  He had time to tweet out about Zoran Mamdani, but not a word about the military accomplishment [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3507.36s)]
*  that they all said we needed to do. That they all said Iran cannot be allowed to get a nuclear [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3514.8s)]
*  weapon. And our boys went out there and made sure it didn't happen. And because it was under Trump, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3519.12s)]
*  they couldn't spare just a fucking tweet just to say, proud to be an American, go Team USA. Or [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3524.16s)]
*  like congrats to our men and women in uniform for once again proving what a true professional looks [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3530.64s)]
*  like. You can absolutely find a way to tip your hat to these guys over whom you were commander [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3536.16s)]
*  in chief for a time without endorsing the mission if you don't want to do that. No, it's more [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3542.8799999999997s)]
*  important to talk about Zoran Mamdani or Juneteenth or in Obama's case himself. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3548.24s)]
*  And it's even deeper like Jeb Bush tweeted out congratulations to President Trump for stopping [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3554.8799999999997s)]
*  Iran's nuclear program. And Trump tweets out, thanks for the shout out Jeb Bush. Like if you [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3559.9199999999996s)]
*  have a situation where President Trump like viciously destroys you Austin. And then you can [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3564.8799999999997s)]
*  come out and be like bygones are bygones. I celebrate America, you know, de-arming a terrible [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3570.0s)]
*  ally of ours and preventing Iran from having a nuclear program. I've given some thought though [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3576.48s)]
*  in the Bill Clinton side of things. And I'm tired of Barack Obama. I don't necessarily need to hear [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3582.48s)]
*  from the Clintons. There is one media appearance that is absolutely essential that he makes at [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3588.32s)]
*  some point. It's that Monica Lewinsky podcast. I mean, can you imagine that would be an absolute [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3592.8s)]
*  barn burner? Now wait, I'm sorry, I'm pausing because I'm just looking at this possible [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3600.48s)]
*  breaking news. It's coming in. The Times of Israel has a report. It's sourced to one source. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3607.44s)]
*  So it's sourcing a local Israeli Hebrew daily newspaper. So it's not the Times of Israel's [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3614.16s)]
*  original reporting. So we'll see whether it's true, but I'll give you the headline. It's that [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3621.92s)]
*  Netanyahu has agreed to end the Gaza war within two weeks after the US strike on the Iranian [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3626.56s)]
*  facilities. And it also goes on to say, again, we don't have this confirmed that the deal will [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3631.6s)]
*  include the expansion of the Abraham Accords, according to a source familiar with the conversation. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3638.64s)]
*  That would be huge. And actually also has a plan for what to do with Gaza. This is according, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3643.6s)]
*  again, they're citing this one outlet that we don't know. We don't know. I don't know. Let's [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3649.7599999999998s)]
*  see. What's this? This is another thing coming in for this paper. Gaza hostilities will conclude [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3655.2s)]
*  within two weeks. Ending conditions. Yeah, will encompass four Arab nations, including Egypt and [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3660.0s)]
*  the UAE to administer the Gaza Strip, replacing the murderous Hamas terrorist organization. The [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3665.12s)]
*  remaining Hamas leadership will face exile to other countries while the hostages gain freedom. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3670.64s)]
*  If this is true, it's huge. If this is true, I mean, there is no reason why President Trump [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3675.68s)]
*  doesn't get the Nobel Peace Prize. If it's true, I mean, these are generational issues, [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3682.8s)]
*  which have been conflicts that have gone unresolved and caused so much loss of life and [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3690.96s)]
*  misery. And if this is true, in six months, this guy, I mean, I'm flabbergasted. I never thought [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3696.2400000000002s)]
*  my lifetime I'd see this. Yeah. And if the Nobel committee can't see it within themselves to give [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3705.1200000000003s)]
*  him that prize, they need to just create a new one called the Trump Peace Prize. This is peace [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3710.88s)]
*  in our time. Possibly like we've never seen in our entire lives. I got the chills. Like I actually, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3716.1600000000003s)]
*  there are hairs standing up in the back of my neck because like they've think of that, [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3723.36s)]
*  even like getting the hostages back is number one, bringing the fighting to a close officially [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3729.76s)]
*  between Israel and Hamas and expanding the Abraham Accords. That's going to be very interesting. Who's [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3735.6s)]
*  next? Saudi would be huge. And then possibly having the UAE and Egypt oversee Gaza. Muslims, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3740.64s)]
*  right? Not the United States, not Israel, most importantly, but Muslims, you know, who don't want [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3749.7599999999998s)]
*  the Palestinians coming to them, but could be responsible for keeping the peace in that region. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3758.0s)]
*  My God, I mean, what a massive undertaking. Again, huge grain of salt to the audience. We do not know, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3762.7999999999997s)]
*  Times of Israel is legit, but we do not know this other paper they're citing. It's a Hebrew daily [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3767.84s)]
*  newspaper who's reporting this based on a phone call. They're saying happened between Trump and [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3773.1200000000003s)]
*  Netanyahu. So, wow. Wow. I hope it's true. That would be such a one. So wonderful for the world. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3777.76s)]
*  We'll put a pin in it until if it's true, it's going to come out probably within the next hour. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3785.84s)]
*  We can round back to it, but I'm just letting you know that that's what I was looking at. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3789.6800000000003s)]
*  I have spent a minute on what happened at the Supreme Court today, which did happen and has [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3793.44s)]
*  been confirmed. Another victory for sanity as the Supreme Court rules that states can cut off [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3796.96s)]
*  Medicaid funding to Planned Parenthood within their states. What happened was the state of [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3807.52s)]
*  South Carolina did it. You're already not supposed to be using taxpayer money on Planned Parenthood, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3814.08s)]
*  on abortion. But what happens in various states is Planned Parenthood says, oh, well, Mary's coming [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3821.36s)]
*  here for contraception or they always say cancer screenings, even though they're really not done [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3827.7599999999998s)]
*  at all. All these Planned Parenthoods. There she's just coming here for cancer screening or her birth [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3833.12s)]
*  control. That's all. But Mary's not going to have an abortion and she's not going to use her Medicaid [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3837.44s)]
*  money for an abortion. And that's how they get Medicaid funding for Mary's visit. But money's [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3842.48s)]
*  fungible. And this Medicaid is a joint state and federal program. So we are funding abortions [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3848.0s)]
*  because our money is going to Planned Parenthood in various states. And there are millions of [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3855.44s)]
*  Americans who have a very, very deep problem with that. Planned Parenthood should get its own money [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3860.08s)]
*  from its own well-heeled, deep-pocketed, leftist donors like Alex Soros now and his weird wife, [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3867.2s)]
*  Uma. And that's where they should get their money. Not from us, not from taxpayers who want [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3875.36s)]
*  nothing to do with abortion. So the Supreme Court has sided with the same people because what happened [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3880.8s)]
*  was Mary, who's not really named Mary in this case, it's an individual who said, I'm going to sue you. [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3886.2400000000002s)]
*  Her name was Julie Edwards saying, I want to keep going back to my South Carolina Planned Parenthood [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3891.76s)]
*  for birth control and I want my Medicaid payments to pay for it. And the governor had said, no, [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3897.1200000000003s)]
*  we're not allowing that for anybody, Julie, sorry. And the Supreme Court just said states actually do [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3904.3199999999997s)]
*  have that right because Medicaid has a private right of action to enforce it. Like you have a [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3909.6s)]
*  right to sort of get the doctor of your choosing. And the Supreme Court said, no, this is one [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3913.2799999999997s)]
*  exception to that rule. The states do not have to allow a private plaintiff to bring a lawsuit if a [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3918.72s)]
*  governor says no public funds for Planned Parenthood are happening in our state. And that's huge, you [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3924.16s)]
*  guys. That's a big ruling. It is really big. It all stems from what they call the Mexico City policy, [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3929.68s)]
*  which is reinstated every time there's a Republican president, which prohibits taxpayer, [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3935.04s)]
*  federal taxpayer dollars for going to pay for abortion. But as the left does with almost [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3940.0s)]
*  everything that they do, they try to figure out a way for taxpayers to pay for their social agenda. [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3944.64s)]
*  Yep. And one way or another. This is a perfect example of how they've done that. The idea [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3950.48s)]
*  Medicaid dollars are going to Planned Parenthood. I mean, we know what that outfit does. And for [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3956.16s)]
*  decades, they've just couched it under women's health. Women's health. This is a women's health [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3962.56s)]
*  clinic. Now it's an abortion store. That's what it is. And let's be very clear about it. But that's [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3968.4s)]
*  a big court ruling. Guys, what a time to be alive and that we're having some sanity all across the board. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3975.04s)]
*  Tomorrow we're going to get, we expect, I think it's the last day of opinions, we expect to get [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3980.56s)]
*  the ruling on whether these nationwide injunctions can keep getting handed down by these district [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3984.32s)]
*  courts, which is the number one form of resistance 2.0 to stop the Trump administration. It's coming [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3988.48s)]
*  up in the context of birthright citizenship, you know, which Trump has said you can't have. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3994.1600000000003s)]
*  He's interpreted the country constitution to say you're not a citizen just because you're born here [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=3999.28s)]
*  if you're born to somebody who doesn't have citizenship and a judge blocked that executive [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4004.7200000000003s)]
*  order and issued a nationwide injunction against enforcing it. And so while this doesn't exactly [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4011.36s)]
*  get to the birthright citizenship issue, that's the context in which the notion of a nationwide [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4017.04s)]
*  injunction is coming up. So this is going to be a very interesting case on all fronts. We'll have [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4022.7200000000003s)]
*  it covered for you tomorrow because it'll come down at 10 a.m. Okay, let's keep going because [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4025.92s)]
*  there's still a lot to get to. We were on Iran. Let's take the close pivot to NATO and related [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4030.0s)]
*  issues. NATO, of course, is an organization that many North Atlantic countries have joined [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4037.8399999999997s)]
*  originally to prevent aggression in the region by countries like Russia. Now it's less clear what [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4044.72s)]
*  exactly we're all doing in this party, but it's very, very important to the Europeans because [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4050.7999999999997s)]
*  we seem to be the big brother who protects everybody and they don't want big brother to [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4055.2s)]
*  leave. They like big brother's muscles. They like big brother's strength and they really like his [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4059.52s)]
*  big military with the big B2s. They want us to get along with the big brother. They want big brother [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4063.28s)]
*  to stay in the alliance. And Trump all along, first term and second, has kind of been saying, [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4067.76s)]
*  I guess we will, but like, we're kind of sick of you freeloading off of us. Why don't you at [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4075.76s)]
*  least pay what you've already agreed to pay, which is the 2% of your GDP, all of you countries, [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4080.1600000000003s)]
*  instead of freeloading? And he went over there and I pulled this for AM update today. People [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4084.5600000000004s)]
*  should listen to that pod, but I pulled the New York Times article from 2018 when he went to NATO [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4088.32s)]
*  and it was so negative. It was like, he has everyone rattled. He's disrespectful. He's [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4093.6800000000003s)]
*  doing things unconventionally. You know, all the backbiting comments about Trump, both from the [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4098.8s)]
*  Times reporters and from other countries who are like, what is this effing thing that's come over [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4105.12s)]
*  here trying to demand we pay 2% for real and threatening to leave NATO if we don't. Now, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4110.32s)]
*  flash forward to all these years later, what, five, six, seven years, and NATO's like, let's [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4117.28s)]
*  do this. And Trump gets them to pay 5% of GDP or at least commit the major nations to commit to [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4123.12s)]
*  doing that. And does the Times say like, nailed it, Mr. President, good for you. You know what? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4129.5199999999995s)]
*  Your irascible nature actually wound up working on these people long-term. No, they complained that [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4135.679999999999s)]
*  they're not actually going to pay the 5%. And why wasn't there more attention on Ukraine and the [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4141.92s)]
*  funding for that war? He can't win. He's at the point where literally the secretary general of [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4146.8s)]
*  NATO is calling him daddy and saying he deserves the praise. Shut up. And they're still like, no, [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4153.28s)]
*  he's failing. He sucks. Okay, so let me give you the soundbites because everybody wants to hear [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4158.8s)]
*  the NATO secretary general, Mark Rutte, and his comments about Trump daddy. This is what [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4164.08s)]
*  set everything off where he referred to him as daddy. I think that's 14. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4170.08s)]
*  They've got a big fight like two kids in a schoolyard. You know they fight like hell. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4173.76s)]
*  You can't stop them. Let them fight for about two, three minutes. Then it's easier to stop them. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4179.12s)]
*  Then daddy has to sometimes use strong language. Strong language. Everyone's throwing up. You have [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4183.4400000000005s)]
*  to use a certain word. Okay, so he didn't say you're my daddy, but he said daddy has to use [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4188.400000000001s)]
*  strong language. That's okay. All right, I'm fine. I think it's fine. Trump gets asked about it by [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4195.76s)]
*  this snarky reporter and says this in Saddle 11. Mark Rutte, the NATO chief who is your friend, [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4200.96s)]
*  he called you daddy earlier. Do you regard your NATO allies as kind of children? No, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4208.64s)]
*  he likes me. I think he likes me. If he doesn't, I'll let you know. I'll come back and I'll hit [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4216.0s)]
*  him hard. Okay. He did. He did it very affectionately. Daddy, you're my daddy. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4220.4s)]
*  How about you, Bianca? One more before I toss it to you. Mark Rutte got asked about it by [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4224.56s)]
*  maybe the same reporter. She sounds terrible. Take a listen. The language that you have used [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4235.84s)]
*  when talking to Donald Trump has been notable because of its flattery. Today you called him [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4241.200000000001s)]
*  daddy and you sent a text message to him that was gushing with praise. Is this the way that you feel [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4247.68s)]
*  that you have to act when doing business with the US president through flattery and praise? [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4255.92s)]
*  Isn't it a bit demeaning and doesn't it make you look weak? No, I don't think so. I think it's a [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4262.56s)]
*  bit of a question of taste, but I think he's a good friend. And when he is doing stuff, which is [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4267.68s)]
*  forcing us to, for example, when it comes to making more investments, would you ever think [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4275.76s)]
*  that this would be the result of this summit if he would not have been re-elected president? Do you [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4282.16s)]
*  really think that seven or eight countries who said somewhere in the 2030s we might meet the 2%? [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4286.16s)]
*  We've now all decided in the last four or five months to get to 2%. So doesn't he deserve some [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4292.4800000000005s)]
*  praise? And when it comes to Iran, the fact that he took this decisive action, very targeted, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4297.6s)]
*  to make sure that Iran would not be able to get his hands on a nuclear capability, [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4303.92s)]
*  I think he deserves all the praise. That's it right there. Right? Former prime minister [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4310.16s)]
*  of the Netherlands there, Mark Rutte. Good for him. Go ahead. Yeah, a couple observations. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4317.52s)]
*  The first is that was the same reporter. Sort of into the daddy talk. It's Deborah Haynes of Sky [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4323.2s)]
*  News. Yeah, she's got a thing with the daddy talk. I don't know what's up with that. You get [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4329.44s)]
*  two questions to ask the president of the United States and the NATO secretary-judge is like, [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4333.679999999999s)]
*  tell me more about the daddy thing. Let's talk more about that. I don't know. I'm not saying. [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4338.0s)]
*  I'm just saying. They're already making t-shirts. They're red and they have Trump's picture on it [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4343.28s)]
*  and they read daddy. Second observation is this guy. What an exceptional head of hair he has. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4347.04s)]
*  Yeah, right. I mean, I will follow that man anywhere. That is incredible. Put it back up. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4355.04s)]
*  I didn't look at the hair. Can we put it back up there? You don't have to run the sound. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4360.24s)]
*  You'll have to. It's S-tier flow. It really is. It's like the kind of thing you would want leading [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4364.0s)]
*  your nation. Yeah, he makes Mitt Romney look like Mr. Clean. Roll the tape, please, producers. Let's [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4368.8s)]
*  see. Not her. No, we're not. Wait, Mark Rutte. Yeah, just a great head of hair. More than happy [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4373.44s)]
*  to field the daddy talk from that young scrying news reporter. They're a good-looking people. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4381.68s)]
*  The thing is that his job is to ensure that NATO is in a position to accomplish what they need to [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4390.400000000001s)]
*  get done. For a reporter to, again, use her time to try to make it, do you feel you need to be effusive [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4398.8s)]
*  in your flattery? That he has to be like, let me present the facts to you. Did you not just see [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4405.84s)]
*  what happened in Iran? Right. He even says, if President Trump had not been reelected, do you [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4411.28s)]
*  think we'd be in a place where all these countries have agreed to this funding? Tell me more about [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4418.16s)]
*  the daddy talk. It's unbelievable. I will tell you. He's like, look, there's a question of taste. [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4422.0s)]
*  I realize you're razzing me. I was making a joke. He's basically like, calm down, Deborah. Take a [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4428.32s)]
*  chill pill. It was humor and he deserves my praise. I mean, is it possible even our friends [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4435.28s)]
*  in Europe are starting to get that the way to deal with these woke asshole reporters is to laugh at [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4441.04s)]
*  them? Go ahead. It's exactly right. It's one of the fringe benefits of Trump being who he is, [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4448.4s)]
*  that all of these other leaders are like, wait a minute. I don't have to just take it from this [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4455.679999999999s)]
*  idiot. I have common sense too. And I'm going to answer your question that is so stupid with [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4459.92s)]
*  normal common sense. And you're going to look really dumb. And Trump has shown everybody, [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4465.6s)]
*  I mean, that's real leadership. He's shown everybody around the world that you can do that [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4471.36s)]
*  and you can win. I mean, it's, and also, you know, I don't think what's been appreciated is the second [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4475.6s)]
*  and third order effects and results of President Trump taking this decisive action. We've already [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4480.88s)]
*  talked about how, you know, the Houthis and Hezbollah and the various groups that Iran would [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4485.76s)]
*  lean on had been dismantled and President Trump used this window of opportunity to then get rid [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4490.0s)]
*  of the nuclear program. Part of the reason Iran also didn't have is because Syria, you see, like [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4494.64s)]
*  the allies in the region that they had are all one by one falling apart. Russia no longer has any say [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4499.84s)]
*  in this region. So Europe's got to be in a happy position. China now can't buy cheap oil from Iran. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4507.68s)]
*  You're seeing a situation where President Trump has been able to just slice through [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4514.4800000000005s)]
*  all these geopolitical problems that we've had. So I imagine Europeans are thrilled. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4518.56s)]
*  Well, it's restoring America to the leader of the free world. [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4523.6s)]
*  Yeah, the Europeans are thrilled, but the left, I'm sure, is furious. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4525.92s)]
*  Oh, they hate it. [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4528.8s)]
*  Because four years of Joe Biden, they all had to walk around and pretend that this guy was bringing [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4529.4400000000005s)]
*  America back on the world stage. You know, like toting a colostomy bag around the Middle East. [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4534.0s)]
*  May or may not have shit his britches over there when he met the Pope or the [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4539.360000000001s)]
*  farted in front of the Queen or something like that. I can't remember. But they must make them [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4544.4800000000005s)]
*  furious to see Donald Trump roll up. Eight years ago, they were laughing at him, like you said, [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4549.4400000000005s)]
*  Holmes. And now, you know, they're kissing the ring. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4553.84s)]
*  And now Mark Ruda, he was like doubling and tripling down. Here's more. Somebody tried to [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4557.200000000001s)]
*  play the... But he's so unpredictable. He's like irascible and he's unpredictable. And here's what [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4563.360000000001s)]
*  Mark Ruda said to that guy, Saat 15. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4571.28s)]
*  He's a good friend. I trust him. He was totally right that Europe and Canada were not basically [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4573.759999999999s)]
*  providing to NATO what we should provide. Now we are correcting that. We are equalizing. I think [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4581.759999999999s)]
*  it is a man of strength, but also a man of peace. You've seen that basically now with Iran, the man [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4585.759999999999s)]
*  of strength being able to command his B2 bombers to go into Iran to take out nuclear capability, [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4592.4s)]
*  but also the man of peace who is then immediately following up with making sure that Israel and [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4599.12s)]
*  Iran will commit to a ceasefire. And I think this is exactly what you want the American president [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4604.88s)]
*  to do, provide that type of leadership. And so I find him very predictable. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4609.68s)]
*  Because the question had been, you're dealing with a very unpredictable president or friend [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4616.0s)]
*  who's been all over the map on Article 5 in the past, but how do you know? How are you certain [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4620.5599999999995s)]
*  that the Trump you're dealing with right now is the same version of Trump that you'll be dealing [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4624.24s)]
*  with for the rest of this term? And he went on, so like the beginning was I've known him for almost [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4627.2s)]
*  10 years. He's a good friend. I trust him. He was totally right. Europe and Canada were not [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4631.36s)]
*  providing to NATO what we should provide. And then goes on to say what you just heard him say, [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4636.32s)]
*  like he is predictable and he's a friend. We've never heard world leaders do this. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4640.72s)]
*  Like this guy seems genuinely inspired by Trump, his strength, his unwillingness to bend. And I can [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4648.24s)]
*  only hope it becomes a little more contagious across the pond because they could use the backbone. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4655.36s)]
*  Okay. I got to spend a moment on Carrie Lake. I can't believe what I saw yesterday. Did you see it? [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4661.5199999999995s)]
*  Oh, sorry. Steve really wants us to play the White House's response to the daddy thing. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4667.28s)]
*  I'm less enamored with it, but okay, we'll play it. Here it is, SOT16. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4672.96s)]
*  The White House puts this out. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4680.24s)]
*  Okay, we get it. It's Trump. They're leaning in. It's cute. The White House has a sense of humor, [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4685.759999999999s)]
*  which we appreciate. Okay. But I got to get to Carrie Lake. So Carrie Lake is working for the [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4694.0s)]
*  president. Hold on. I got to get my papers here. Okay. She's working for the president right now as [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4700.48s)]
*  a senior advisor at the US agency for global media. And she's do she's dogeifying it, which Trump [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4706.48s)]
*  instructed her to do. She announced last week that this group was eliminating 1400 positions, [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4714.16s)]
*  which is an 85% cut of the personnel from March. And that's when Trump signed an executive order [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4720.8s)]
*  gutting the agency does not think this is an important agency. They oversee voice of America, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4726.24s)]
*  which, you know, as like radio reporting throughout the world and funds several other [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4731.04s)]
*  independent broadcast outlets stationed around the globe. During the hearing, she was talking about [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4736.5599999999995s)]
*  how one of the reasons they're getting rid of all these people is because it's staffed with people [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4741.76s)]
*  who hate America. This is clearly Trump's conclusion to. Yeah, exactly. So she went in there to, you know, [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4746.08s)]
*  what's the way to basically take a sledgehammer to them, chainsaw to them. And now they're having [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4755.84s)]
*  hearings on Capitol Hill talking about whether this is a good idea. And one of the persons who [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4762.24s)]
*  cross examined her was Arizona. That's where she's from. Democratic representative, Greg Stanton. Now, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=4767.68s)]

*  Gill gets Dr. Sean Harper in front of him. And here's a bit of that in SOC 27. Which race do [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5180.56s)]
*  you think should be preferred? I do not think that a single race should be preferred. You just [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5186.56s)]

*  Democratic nomination, looking pretty good for winning the entire mayoral race. However, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5460.64s)]
*  two interesting things. It appears that Cuomo is now out entirely. He's not going to run as [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5466.56s)]
*  an independent. And now there's growing pressure on Curtis Sliwa, the Republican guardian angel, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5471.120000000001s)]
*  to drop out because even though we love Curtis, and it would be so nice if a Republican could be [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5477.92s)]
*  the mayor, it's not going to happen. He has no chance. So there's pressure on him to get out [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5483.76s)]
*  so that the city can coalesce behind Eric Adams, who is the last best choice of stopping Mondami [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5489.28s)]
*  right now. His relaunch at his campaign offices has people lining up around the block in New York. [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5500.72s)]
*  I mean, he's gotten a second life here. What's going to happen? And how did this happen? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5508.320000000001s)]
*  Oh, jeez. The funniest take I saw on the internet about all this was, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5515.36s)]
*  we've all been concerned about the Islamic extremist reaction and potential consequence [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5521.6s)]
*  to America as a result of the Iranian bombing it. We just didn't know it would come so quickly [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5527.84s)]
*  in the form of a Democratic primary. Yeah, this is a bad news deal, but it's indicative of where [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5532.24s)]
*  the Democratic Party is. Their energy is all behind not just somebody who's totally unqualified [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5540.48s)]
*  to run a city like that, but somebody whose ideas are so antithetical to America in and of itself [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5546.4s)]
*  and so off the left-hand side of the map. They're killing themselves. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5553.44s)]
*  And I love it. It's terrific. So here's the thing is if you look at the breakdown of where he won, [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5559.919999999999s)]
*  Mondani won in New York City, upper middle class and wealthy people came out in droves to vote for [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5565.84s)]
*  him. Yeah, because Margins and Bed-Stuy and Bushwick. Yeah. So like, poor voters went for Cuomo. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5571.2s)]
*  The blacks, the Hispanics and the working class all went for Cuomo. They did not vote for this guy. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5577.76s)]
*  It was the white college-educated graduate degree holders across Manhattan and Brooklyn. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5582.8s)]
*  So this deranged kind of white guilt, which has just gripped the progressive movement [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5590.0s)]
*  of thinking that, well, white people are evil. Capitalism is evil. Even though I have a place [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5595.2s)]
*  in the Upper East Side, capitalism is a horrible system. Doesn't work for people, even though, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5600.72s)]
*  you know, from Park Ave, I go shopping on Madison every day. It's a wonderful system for me. But [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5604.96s)]
*  I think we need a communist. They get what they deserve. They're going to get what they deserve. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5609.84s)]
*  For so many folks, Megan, yourself included, who no longer live in New York, who don't have a place [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5616.24s)]
*  in there, you see what they've done. It just keeps getting worse and worse and worse. They're really [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5620.08s)]
*  whittled down the old talent pool of candidates, right? I mean, we were basically down to a choice [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5624.08s)]
*  between a guy who killed your grandmother and a socialist psychopath. Or, you know, [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5628.72s)]
*  we're the current guy, which is like no bucket of fruit. It reminds me of back in the day, [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5634.32s)]
*  CNN, I'm going to screw this up, but CNN launched a competitor to the five. Roger had come up with [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5640.32s)]
*  the five. And as he likes to say, people thought that, liked to say, people thought he named it [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5645.92s)]
*  that because it had five hosts. But he says, I named it that because that's about how long it [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5651.36s)]
*  took me to think it up. That he'd have five hosts on at five hosting a news program. And it's hugely [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5655.36s)]
*  successful. I think it's still the number one show on cable news. And CNN decided to try to do the [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5662.16s)]
*  same thing. And they came up with, they have no original ideas. So they came up with their own [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5667.599999999999s)]
*  group that was going to go like across from this group. And if memory serves, it was like Van Jones [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5672.4s)]
*  and S.E. Cupp. And I can't remember who the others were, but I remember Roger's like, [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5679.12s)]
*  my God, he's like, they've got an atheist, they've got a communist, they've got a Marx, [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5685.599999999999s)]
*  I can't remember the other one. He's like, so far, I'm rooting for the communist. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5690.48s)]
*  Anyway, it's kind of the situation New Yorkers are in, in looking at these candidates. Like, [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5695.599999999999s)]
*  I think I want the corrupt one who just takes money from Egypt, allegedly. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5701.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, like you look at New York City, like, you know, how America looks at a place like [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5706.0s)]
*  Syria during the Civil War. It's like, we need to fund the moderate New Yorkers on the ground. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5710.4s)]
*  Right. I know it's true. It's like, well, I was talking to somebody about Syria the other day, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5717.6s)]
*  and it's like, you know, it was taken over by Al Qaeda, but they don't seem that Al Qaeda-y. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5722.64s)]
*  So, you know, fingers crossed. These are not good positions to be in. [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5728.16s)]
*  So, you tell me, because like, there's a debate playing out about whether this guy, [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5734.320000000001s)]
*  Mondami, is a reflection of like, too much illegal immigration, and no, people don't assimilate, [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5737.84s)]
*  and they bring their values, and then the white working, the white upper class that has the white [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5743.280000000001s)]
*  guilt, you know, buying into all those messages, and this coalition is born. And then there's [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5748.64s)]
*  another line of thinking that's more something you might hear from a Steve Bannon, you know, [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5753.04s)]
*  which is like, it's the left's populist uprising. These young people can't buy homes, and they can't [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5758.8s)]
*  get a decent job, and they can't make it without both the mom and the dad working, and they just, [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5765.12s)]
*  they want a revolution. They want to burn shit down, and the socialist message of just taxing [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5770.56s)]
*  the billionaires is extremely attractive. And so, and by the way, those people have never lived [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5775.04s)]
*  during the New York of the 1970s or late 80s, so they've totally forgotten what these leftist [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5780.8s)]
*  policies actually lead to. But what do you think? I think, I think that the second thing that you [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5785.2s)]
*  mentioned, I think there's some validity to that. There are people who don't see any path to buy [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5791.28s)]
*  their own home out there off the left-hand side, but you don't need to put your hopes in a guy [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5796.0s)]
*  that's going to take away your guns and control the food flow into Manhattan. Everything that [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5801.679999999999s)]
*  he is talking about is going to turn Manhattan into Gaza, and they're going to start shooting [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5807.44s)]
*  rockets from Flatiron into Williamsburg. This guy is absolutely insane, and he is not the only [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5813.2s)]
*  leftist out there. There has to be somebody else who is literally not going to get rid of the cops, [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5821.04s)]
*  not get either like everything he's talking about. That doesn't, that doesn't put somebody in a home. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5827.04s)]
*  Yeah, it's also indicative of this larger lack of leadership within the Democratic party in and of [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5832.639999999999s)]
*  itself, right? I mean, both political parties from time to time have been captured by this like [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5837.76s)]
*  super radical, totally inconsistent with where the center of the country is type movement. It's [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5842.56s)]
*  full of energy for a variety of different reasons, but always there's somebody that provides some [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5847.92s)]
*  leadership to try to like recapitalize that and make sure that, no, these are good policies. [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5853.200000000001s)]
*  Like you don't need a clinically insane person to lead you down the road in order to have, [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5858.400000000001s)]
*  you know, what it is that you're all really looking for. I think Donald Trump's done a lot [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5863.280000000001s)]
*  of that within the Republican party, but if you look around like Chuck Schumer in the home state [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5866.4800000000005s)]
*  here, Chuck Schumer and Keem Jeffries, they're the first ones who are just dodging all of this, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5870.56s)]
*  right? A real leader would sit there and be like, look, we're not going to get rid of the NYPD, [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5875.76s)]
*  which is what this guy is campaigning on. Clearly that's not something that Democrats believe in, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5881.280000000001s)]
*  except he can't say it and he won't say it, which is how this has grown within the Democratic party. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5886.160000000001s)]
*  Yeah, Bill Clinton is congratulating him. That's another thing Bill Clinton weighed in on [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5891.68s)]
*  rather than our troops victory and seems to be all in on this guy. Notwithstanding what we just said, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5896.88s)]
*  Bill Clinton doesn't want the prisons open and the cops gone. Go ahead, Duncan. [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5903.2s)]
*  Well, and neither do the lower income and middle income voters of New York. Like if there was this [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5907.36s)]
*  left-wing populism idea that is so popular, you would think the New Yorkers who are struggling [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5916.719999999999s)]
*  the most would have voted for it, but they didn't. They voted for Cuomo, right? It was the [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5921.36s)]
*  affluent, the wealthy over a hundred thousand dollars a year who were voting for this guy. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5925.84s)]
*  So I think it's more just the luxury beliefs of people who don't actually have to worry about, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5929.68s)]
*  well, you abolish prisons, you're going to let all the criminals out in the street. But I live [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5934.56s)]
*  a hundred floors up, so it doesn't matter to me. This has become the base of the Democratic party. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5938.64s)]
*  Doorman building, security, possibly an iron fence around my doorman building. They can't get to me. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5944.24s)]
*  And on the Upper East Side, where my children go to private school, we'll have no problems [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5951.2s)]
*  no matter what I vote for. That's why you get enough cases. That's my thing is I hope Zoran can [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5954.64s)]
*  can mobilize his supporters to actually storm the doorman building. I think that's what it's going [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5959.360000000001s)]
*  to take. Yeah, that is what it's going to take. Well, that's a lot of people are saying that like, [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5963.52s)]
*  let's let them see what the natural consequences of this decision are. Let's not save them from [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5968.320000000001s)]
*  1970s New York. Let's watch them experience it. It's sad to me. I mean, we moved right outside of [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5974.8s)]
*  New York and it's like, I still love New York and we go into New York and I want my kids to be able [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5980.32s)]
*  to go there and your kids to be able to go there and watch a Broadway show and not worry about [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5985.599999999999s)]
*  getting shot in the face. Yeah, it's just, it's, this is a dark moment for the city and the country [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5988.799999999999s)]
*  and I hope for the Democrat party. I don't, I don't know what their future looks like. In any event, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5994.639999999999s)]
*  not a dark moment for the fellas because we always have things to talk about. It's great to see you [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=5999.44s)]
*  guys. Great to see you, Megan. Thank you so much. Thanks for having us. The pleasure's all mine. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=6004.0s)]
*  And don't forget, uh, ladies and gentlemen, tomorrow on the show, Maureen Callahan will be here [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=6009.28s)]
*  and we will have the premiere of our latest parody. Both of us are in it. Megan Oh, see you then. [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVnyBXDT38I&t=6013.759999999999s)]
