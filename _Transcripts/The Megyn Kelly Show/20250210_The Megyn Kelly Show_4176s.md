Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by the hosts of The Daily Wire's "Crain & Company" to discuss Taylor Swift getting booed at the Super Bowl, her political turn failing and bringing many Americans out against her, the massive positive reaction President Trump got at the Super Bowl, the unsuccessful halftime performance of Kendrick Lamar, the media trying to make criticism of the performance racial, Pfizer and Bud Light trying to counter past bad press with new Super Bowl ads, great ads from Jeep and Uber Eats, and more. Then Megyn Kelly takes viewers and listeners behind the scenes to discuss her experience at the Super Bowl, her near run-in with Taylor Swift outside the bathroom, her impromptu meeting with President Trump, and her positive interactions with Karoline Leavitt and Donald Trump Jr., then addresses the ridiculous attacks on Trump and Elon Musk over the DOGE cuts.

# Trump Cheered at Super Bowl, Taylor Gets Booed, & Bud Light Tries to Make a Comeback, w/ Crain & Co
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=0.0s)]
*  I am just back from the Super Bowl where [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2.9s)]
*  Patriotism was on full display this year and it was amazing to witness after so many years of woke [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=7.32s)]
*  programming commercials [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=15.22s)]
*  divisive messaging [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=17.04s)]
*  I mean, I literally just got back like an hour and a half ago and came straight from the airport [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=18.240000000000002s)]
*  It was a wonderful event [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=23.52s)]
*  I have never been to the Super Bowl before and I really thoroughly enjoyed myself [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=25.62s)]
*  I have to say it's like one of those things everybody's in a great mood, you know, people are there celebrating their teams [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=30.700000000000003s)]
*  It's a fun competition. I did not realize it would be such a networking kind of spot [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=36.78s)]
*  I mean like everybody from corporate America was there because they network there [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=42.38s)]
*  Which is something that's not really up my aisle to be perfectly honest [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=46.66s)]
*  But I did meet a lot of nice lovely people and I got a chance to say hello to President Trump [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=50.62s)]
*  You may have seen on my Instagram where I posted a picture and I'll tell you in just a little bit about [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=57.18s)]
*  How that went and what happened inside the Trump suite at? [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=62.739999999999995s)]
*  Super Bowl 59 [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=67.86s)]
*  But I want to get to today's guests before we go through all that. This was not controversy free [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=69.66s)]
*  but it was a great game and [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=75.3s)]
*  Especially if you're an eagle, I mean it was just I know the final score was like 40 to 22 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=78.06s)]
*  But that of course does not reflect how tight it was or I mean how would a blowout it was [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=82.89999999999999s)]
*  Throughout the entire game. It's like the Eagles crushed them. They crushed them. Sorry chiefs fans, you know, you had you had a lot [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=86.94s)]
*  I mean, I think you won it two years in a row. I can't remember [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=94.9s)]
*  I don't know anything about sports, but I know the chiefs have won a lot [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=96.94s)]
*  So go birds [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=100.62s)]
*  Of course the biggest loser of the night was not Travis Kelsey, but his girlfriend Taylor Swift [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=103.18s)]
*  That's what Trump said in a post he made on social media thereafter and he was not wrong [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=108.98s)]
*  There's a lot to talk about joining me now the hosts of the daily wires sports show [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=113.9s)]
*  Craning company Blaine Crane Jake Crane and David Cohn [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=118.38000000000001s)]
*  Don't miss a moment subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on insta Facebook and X [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=123.5s)]
*  I have got some good news for you. It's called firecracker farm hot salt [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=129.88s)]
*  This small family business is making waves and if you haven't tried it yet, it's time to change that [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=133.84s)]
*  It was the gift to give and receive this Christmas. It is delicious. It elevates everything it touches [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=138.72s)]
*  I mean eggs avocado toast grilled chicken and more it's got a kick, but it's not overwhelming [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=144.06s)]
*  The flavor enhances food without overpowering it the best part [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=149.6s)]
*  It comes in sleek stainless steel grinders that are easy to take anywhere [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=153.2s)]
*  Unlike messy hot sauce that runs out quickly firecracker farm hot salt lasts and lasts [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=157.56s)]
*  Providing hundreds of servings from one grinder way more bang for the buck [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=163.04000000000002s)]
*  There are plenty of blends to choose from and refills are available for those who find it a bit too spicy [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=167.0s)]
*  You can mix it with a little regular sea salt and that will tame the heat just perfectly [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=171.88000000000002s)]

*  Really enjoyed it. I did not know I enjoyed sports this much [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=199.0s)]
*  Maybe I will go to other live sports events now as a result of this one [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=202.2s)]
*  It is it always so festive and everybody's in a great mood [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=205.56s)]
*  Well, it depends on where you're at I mean at the Super Bowl it's been a great year [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=208.8s)]
*  I mean I you you know, you you come back where come back down where we're at and look in SEC country [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=213.6s)]
*  And we may take you to an Iron Bowl and let you see maybe a little bit more vitriol [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=218.84s)]
*  But no the the Super Bowl everybody's feeling good [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=223.72s)]
*  And you know if you're a chiefs fan until they kicked off and then it was just an absolute bloodletting as we call it back home [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=226.52s)]
*  You're like a sleep on the field. I don't I joked because my husband's from Philadelphia and [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=232.16s)]
*  Philadelphia and we were driving home and I was like you feeling good. He's like, yeah feeling really good [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=236.72000000000003s)]
*  I like are you gonna go burn shit? Like isn't that what you do? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=241.52s)]
*  They were burning things in Philadelphia [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=250.0s)]
*  Well, I mean at what point I just think I don't even think it's about them winning or losing [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=252.32000000000002s)]
*  I just think they want to burn stuff. Yeah, like it just doesn't matter whatever happens is an excuse to do that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=256.16s)]
*  They just want to go burn stuff [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=261.16s)]
*  I've never understood that burning down your city after you know, I just don't [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=263.04s)]
*  See, I'm actually a Giants fan. I grew up a Giants fan because my dad loved the Giants. My brother loved the Giants [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=268.04s)]
*  I don't really know anything about sports, but if I have to put on a jersey, that's the we don't burn shit [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=273.44s)]
*  We don't we cheer we have like ticker tape parades [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=277.48s)]
*  I don't understand the rioting and destroying your city [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=279.96s)]
*  But I'm still rooting for the Eagles because I do think that Saquon Barkley is a class act [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=282.4s)]
*  What a sweet guy [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=288.08s)]
*  Every story I heard about him was about of him being generous to like the guys coming up behind him him when I heard him [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=290.12s)]
*  Interviewed giving the credit to other people. He he's humble. There's a humility about him. He's got a sweet face [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=296.0s)]
*  It was his birthday. I don't know [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=302.36s)]
*  I'm just like a huge fan and that was one thing the Giants did very wrong [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=304.24s)]
*  Somehow he wound up an eagle instead of a giant but anyway, what a star he was and then I guess the quarterback was the other [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=307.71999999999997s)]
*  big star of the night hurts [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=314.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=316.44s)]
*  Yeah, well, I mean Jalen Hurts cone is Jalen Hurts what a comeback story [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=317.67999999999995s)]
*  I mean you want to talk about the class act this guy gets beat out at Alabama [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=321.56s)]
*  Deservingly so to a tag of I lo is one of the best college quarterbacks [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=325.15999999999997s)]
*  I've ever seen not a word against Alabama from Jalen Hurts not a word against his former coach [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=328.23999999999995s)]
*  Nick Saban goes to Oklahoma plays really well [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=333.17999999999995s)]
*  There's a Heisman finalist gets drafted nothing but a class act and he's not the only one either Brandon Graham [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=335.47999999999996s)]
*  There's so many classy guys in in this organization and well-run organization [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=340.67999999999995s)]
*  Saquon Barkley is the perfect role model you want to be a captain of the team if I'm a head coach [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=345.44s)]
*  Or I'm a GM not only is he one of the most talented guys in the NFL especially at the running back position [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=349.79999999999995s)]
*  But he cares about his teammates more he cares about himself. He doesn't care about him stats [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=354.96s)]
*  He cares about winning not only winning regular season games, but winning championships, and I think you put Jalen Hurts in the same boat [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=359.0s)]
*  I don't know two better leaders right now in the NFL other than Jalen Hurts and Saquon Barkley do it the right way [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=365.26s)]
*  Okay, so we all agree the Eagles are of course the big winners of the evening Congrats to them and Congrats to Philly and [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=371.68s)]
*  Then there were the big losers obviously the Kansas City Chiefs. They lost that was sad [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=378.71999999999997s)]
*  I mean at least they made it a great season [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it's a it's a seems to be a world-class football team from what everybody says [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=385.08s)]
*  It was actually funny. We were walking and kind of late like trying to get there you guys will appreciate this they [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=390.56s)]
*  They had shuttle buses to take us over, but we missed them [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=396.0s)]
*  It just didn't work out with our schedule [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=400.6s)]
*  So we had to be driven and so Doug and I got driven as close as you could get and then we had to get [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=402.24s)]
*  Out and walk and it was pouring rain, so it was very sad ladies because my hair got ruined [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=407.44s)]
*  And you know it was like a big night. I wound up getting photographed with the president [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=411.76s)]
*  I would have liked to have had good hair [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=415.88s)]
*  Whatever God had different plans [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=417.68s)]
*  But we're walking in with everybody into the stadium and it was such a shit show getting into this place [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=419.96000000000004s)]
*  not only because the Super Bowl because Trump was there and social security not so secret these Secret Service and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=425.64s)]
*  We're getting rained on we were literally told to go around the block. We were just literally working in circles [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=432.04s)]
*  There's a guy who is an what's the name of the Chiefs coach? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=438.08000000000004s)]
*  in any read [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=442.76s)]
*  Andy Reed it's an Andy Reed look-alike. I mean the guy [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=444.48s)]
*  Is identical and he's just kind of walking there with one other guy with him, and there's a woman behind me like [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=448.68s)]
*  Do you think we're going the right way? I'm like I have no idea she goes we must be I'm like [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=454.8s)]
*  What do you think she goes? There's the coach? [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=458.24s)]
*  Literally, it's like five minutes to kick off. I'm like I don't I [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=460.84s)]
*  Don't know anything about football, but I don't and then we get there. We have to wait. They shut down the gate [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=464.84s)]
*  We're waiting waiting wait. I look at Doug, and I was like is this really worth it [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=470.68s)]
*  It looks like are you kidding me? We're waiting we're going in so we did well [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=474.96s)]
*  Well Megan I wonder how many people Andy Reed there's probably a lot of Andy Reed like look-alikes like in in the United States [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=481.59999999999997s)]
*  I think any read would be a guy you could find a lot of look-alikes. You know bigger [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=487.79999999999995s)]
*  Mustache not really this guy knows he's a look-alike he is I overheard him [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=491.76s)]
*  Like in a photo lineup people choose him sometimes [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=498.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think like Andy reads the type of guy who could enter an Andy Reed look-alike contest and not even win and lose [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=502.58s)]
*  Megan I don't know if you've seen the video of Andy Reed when he was what 13 he won a punt pass and kick contest [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=513.1s)]
*  He's the same size Megan like this same size if you get a chance [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=519.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, y'all need to see that clip it is he's like the kid we all grew up it with that's 12 [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=524.04s)]
*  But looks 30 years old like there's always that one in the group 100% [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=528.3s)]
*  There's always that one [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=533.14s)]
*  so okay [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=535.06s)]
*  That the biggest loser on team chiefs. I do believe was Taylor Swift [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=536.6999999999999s)]
*  I think it's fair to say and we wound up I told the audience on it last week. We were guests of YouTube [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=541.14s)]
*  Which you know as you know a lot of our audience watches the show on YouTube [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=546.9s)]
*  We've had record numbers on YouTube actually stunning numbers over the past six months in particular, but [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=550.4599999999999s)]
*  So we went and [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=556.34s)]
*  To the right literally right next to us was Taylor Swift and then to the left was Donald Trump [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=557.9s)]
*  I mean they were there there's Doug and yours truly and you can see Taylor Swift right behind us [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=564.34s)]
*  that was her booth and and [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=568.74s)]
*  The Kelsey mom and families and then if you look to my left [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=571.14s)]
*  There's Trump. He was one two two boxes over from us and what a juxtaposition in [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=575.94s)]
*  The crowd reaction so Taylor Swift got popped up on the jumbotron as [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=582.66s)]
*  As happens with these big stars and here's what happened [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=588.9s)]
*  Those are booze [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=597.54s)]
*  All right, and then here's what happened when Trump showed up on cam [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=607.0999999999999s)]
*  What globalization [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=612.4599999999999s)]
*  what's up, okay [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=631.02s)]
*  You guys. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=633.02s)]
*  You were in between that? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=640.68s)]
*  You were right in between those two? [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=642.34s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=643.98s)]
*  Yeah, I was right in between those two. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=644.98s)]
*  Right in between those two. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=647.14s)]
*  What a moment. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=648.14s)]
*  It was just so obvious. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=649.14s)]
*  The crowd loved Trump. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=650.14s)]
*  She looked confused about why the crowd was booing her. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=653.6s)]
*  And I submit to you gentlemen, it doesn't have anything to do with, well, maybe a tiny [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=656.66s)]
*  bit to do with her support of the Chiefs, because I do think it was a predominantly Eagles crowd. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=661.0799999999999s)]
*  It has to do with her politics and her shoving them down our throat, taking a side, endorsing [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=665.3199999999999s)]
*  Kamala Harris because of Tim Walz and his let's trans everyone's children and put tampons [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=672.62s)]
*  in men's rooms policies. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=679.24s)]
*  She's managed to alienate more than half of the country, Taylor, sorry, FA, FO. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=681.8s)]
*  You were in the FO part of your political endorsement phase. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=689.28s)]
*  No doubt. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=692.56s)]
*  Well, I'm still trying to recover from a post I made a few weeks ago where I said in a world [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=693.56s)]
*  full of Taylor Swift's be Carrie Underwood and I stand by that. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=697.8199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that is a good tweet. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=700.92s)]
*  I think a lot of people are, to me, this was even more than about football. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=702.16s)]
*  It's almost a culture reckoning here. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=708.16s)]
*  People are tired of the media putting false idols in front of them with a political agenda [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=710.62s)]
*  and they want to get behind a real leader that the people can understand that actually [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=714.8s)]
*  see eye to eye with and that's Donald Trump. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=718.12s)]
*  This wasn't about the Philly fans or Eagles booing them because she roots for Travis [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=720.48s)]
*  Kelsey and the Chiefs. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=723.84s)]
*  It's exactly what you said, Megan. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=724.84s)]
*  It's the political things. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=726.12s)]
*  Whoever propped Taylor up to be this position, I'll never know. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=727.48s)]
*  NFL fans don't want this and America doesn't want this. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=730.76s)]
*  So I'm not sorry. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=733.44s)]
*  I don't feel bad for her at all. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=734.6s)]
*  She deserved what she got. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=736.34s)]
*  Yeah, I don't feel. [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=738.16s)]
*  Taylor Swift's made so much money at the end of the day. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=739.16s)]
*  You'd be hard pressed to make me feel bad for her about anything. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=741.8s)]
*  But I think this goes back to authenticity. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=744.6s)]
*  I think even the people that don't like Donald Trump respect him because at least he is being [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=746.9599999999999s)]
*  who he truly is. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=752.24s)]
*  Taylor Swift feels like a puppet. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=753.64s)]
*  It feels like a puppet. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=756.26s)]
*  If you watch her political affiliation and that mixed with them just shoving her down [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=757.26s)]
*  our throats as football fans the whole year in the past two years, I think it all culminated [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=761.76s)]
*  in that and that's the juxtaposition. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=767.76s)]
*  You may not like me personally, but I'm real and you can respect that. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=770.02s)]
*  You may not like me personally, but I'm inauthentic. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=773.9599999999999s)]
*  I'm going to boo the inauthentic person and you know what? [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=776.68s)]
*  That makes me feel like we're more back than any. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=779.48s)]
*  Who do you think gets a louder standing ovation in that moment though? [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=781.6s)]
*  Donald Trump or Megyn Kelly? [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=784.28s)]
*  I'm going to go Megyn Kelly. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=785.76s)]
*  I'm going to go Megyn Kelly. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=787.56s)]
*  Trust me. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=789.56s)]
*  I'm going to go the stadium. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=790.56s)]
*  Even with messed up hair, which I'm sure look great, I'd still go Megyn Kelly. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=793.56s)]
*  For sure. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=796.6s)]
*  It could have looked better, I'm not going to lie. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=797.6s)]
*  I will tell you my favorite celeb sighting of the whole weekend and there were some great, [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=800.5200000000001s)]
*  very cool people there, but I was like it when I get surprised. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=807.48s)]
*  I swung by this Fox party, my old hot, and guess who came over to me and told me he was [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=811.72s)]
*  my number one fan? [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=819.26s)]
*  I'm probably going to get him in trouble, but he's a big fan apparently of the MK show. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=820.26s)]
*  Rob Lowe. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=824.72s)]
*  Yes. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=825.72s)]
*  Really? [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=826.72s)]
*  Black star Rob Lowe. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=828.36s)]
*  I was like, welcome aboard on the fair and balanced squad. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=830.28s)]
*  He didn't say what his politics were, but he was just, I think he was talking about [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=835.46s)]
*  honesty. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=838.84s)]
*  You know, he appreciated the honesty of the show and didn't show his politics one way [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=839.84s)]
*  or the other. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=843.88s)]
*  But to your point about authenticity, people know when they're getting it, right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=844.88s)]
*  They know. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=849.76s)]
*  They know with Trump, they're getting the real deal. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=850.76s)]
*  And I think with Taylor Swift, she's had some good like battles that she's fought. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=852.72s)]
*  She stood up for herself, that whole scooter bra thing, and they tried to steal her music [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=856.64s)]
*  away. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=860.52s)]
*  And for a while, the country was uniformly behind her. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=861.52s)]
*  But she blew it. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=864.12s)]
*  She blew it by two things. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=866.18s)]
*  I say number one, overexposure. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=867.18s)]
*  Same thing happened to JLo. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=869.6s)]
*  She was too much, too many places where it's just like, I'm sick of you. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=870.84s)]
*  I gave you some celebration. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=875.88s)]
*  Maybe I brought my kid to your era's tour. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=878.36s)]
*  Now I get you shoved down my throat in every magazine cover all over the internet at the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=880.72s)]
*  football games every week. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=886.2s)]
*  And I'm just trying to watch the game. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  I'm sick of you. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=889.8000000000001s)]
*  And then secondly, and more importantly, she got political. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=891.6400000000001s)]
*  And I'm sorry, no matter which side you choose, you're going to alienate half of the country, [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=895.0400000000001s)]
*  especially when you go for the Dem and say it's the LGBTQ piece of the Dem platform that's [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=901.32s)]
*  making you endorse them. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=909.32s)]
*  In particular, she named Tim Walz a lunatic who literally would like to trans our children [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=911.5600000000001s)]
*  and take custody away from us if we don't want to do it. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=917.5600000000001s)]
*  And also she abandoned her country music roots. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=922.08s)]
*  I know that's just a different part of this, but still that's where she came from. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=924.36s)]
*  And I don't fault her at all for becoming a pop star. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=928.2800000000001s)]
*  And hey, my origins are just as a country music artist. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=930.88s)]
*  But it feels like part of it, she's abandoned that completely just to go sing pop music [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=933.52s)]
*  and has sort of never returned or to that demographic of fame. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=938.0s)]
*  I mean, in a weird way, this kind of has shades. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=941.04s)]
*  And Megan, you may remember this of the Dixie Chicks and what happened to them. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=943.3199999999999s)]
*  I mean, I remember that call from Grace when they got political. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=947.24s)]
*  Now, it's not to the extent with Taylor Swift because they were still singing country music [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=950.5999999999999s)]
*  and things like that. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=954.92s)]
*  But I would put to you, Megan, that one of the main reasons outside of awful policy, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=955.76s)]
*  I mean, Tim Walz, as sad as it is, I think he was just born that way. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=960.52s)]
*  I think he's that type of person. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=963.9599999999999s)]
*  He's insane. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=965.56s)]
*  Wanting to put tampons in the boys bathrooms and calling yourself a football coach when [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=966.64s)]
*  we all know you weren't. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=970.12s)]
*  And meanwhile, at the same time, you were in Tiananmen Square standing up in front of [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=971.12s)]
*  tanks when you weren't even there. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=974.64s)]
*  Run that big six. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=976.12s)]
*  That's a story for another day. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=977.12s)]
*  But I would put to you, Megan, that one of the same reasons that Kamala lost so badly, [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=978.48s)]
*  I think she would have lost even if she was an OK candidate, was the inauthenticity. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=983.68s)]
*  And that same thing has started to drag Taylor Swift down at the end of the day, not just [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=988.64s)]
*  getting political, not just backing the wrong political horse, but you can smell a fake [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=993.32s)]
*  from a mile away. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=998.36s)]
*  And she's 100 percent fake when it comes to this stuff. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=999.4399999999999s)]
*  And outside of talking about 14 year old boys that she broke up with, I don't know if there's [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1002.84s)]
*  anything authentic about her. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1006.56s)]
*  Give me Lainey Wilson any day who I met and spent some time with and loved, by the way. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1009.0799999999999s)]
*  She was amazing. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1014.28s)]
*  She's from Louisiana. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1015.12s)]
*  I did not realize that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1015.9599999999999s)]
*  What a class act. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1017.3199999999999s)]
*  Super talented. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1018.92s)]
*  Was nice to everybody. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1019.92s)]
*  Loved spending some time with her and getting to know her and her team. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1021.6s)]
*  OK, let's talk about the game, because I definitely sensed a shift. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1024.48s)]
*  Did you guys not? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1029.72s)]
*  In like what's happening in our culture happened at the Super Bowl. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1030.72s)]
*  And this, of course, is a cultural touchstone. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1034.44s)]
*  You know, touchstone it always is. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1036.48s)]
*  So first of all, we had a presidential interview at the halftime again. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1039.0s)]
*  I know it's not everybody's highlight, but it's important. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1043.44s)]
*  It's something we do. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1046.3600000000001s)]
*  It's part of tradition. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1047.32s)]
*  And the fact that Joe Biden couldn't and or wouldn't do this to maintain this long [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1049.0s)]
*  held tradition was disgraceful. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1055.56s)]
*  We knew it was because he wasn't all there. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1057.36s)]
*  He's still not all there. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1060.36s)]
*  That's why Trump just stripped him that plus fair game because it was done to Trump of [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1061.48s)]
*  his security clearance, saying he even the special counsel Robert, Robert Hearst said, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1065.6s)]
*  well, meaning elderly man with a poor memory. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1070.24s)]
*  Why would we be giving this guy top top secret classified documents access? [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1072.36s)]
*  But in any event, Trump gave the interview to Bret Baier. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1077.6s)]
*  He did great. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1080.0s)]
*  It was a snappy seven minute piece of a longer interview that Bret's airing tonight. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1080.6s)]
*  And we'll have highlights of it tomorrow. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1084.6399999999999s)]
*  But that was number one. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1086.56s)]
*  The president for the first time showed up, was robust, was having a great time, was [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1087.3999999999999s)]
*  glad handing with everybody a moment for the country to celebrate our shared leadership [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1092.1599999999999s)]
*  and wasn't too infirm to sit down and go mano a mano with Bret Baier. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1096.84s)]
*  Let's start there. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1102.32s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1104.1599999999999s)]
*  Well, you brought back an old tradition. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1104.4399999999998s)]
*  You mentioned the Super Bowl halftime one that Joe Biden sat out. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1106.52s)]
*  Now he didn't know he was sitting out. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1109.32s)]
*  We think they took him to a little league football game and told him it was the Super [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1110.6s)]
*  Bowl and he thought he probably did one. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1113.44s)]
*  But maybe starting a new tradition where the sitting president goes to the Super Bowl. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1115.28s)]
*  What is more American than that? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1119.76s)]
*  What is more American than that entrance that Donald Trump had shaken hands with the [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1121.36s)]
*  players there before the game? [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1125.56s)]
*  And then we talk about juxtaposition. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1127.6399999999999s)]
*  You talk about Taylor Swift sitting on one side and Donald Trump sitting on the other. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1129.6399999999999s)]
*  How about the juxtaposition of the president not only doing the interview, but looking [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1133.48s)]
*  unbelievably cognizant and going at warp speed in the first couple of weeks of his [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1137.3600000000001s)]
*  administration? That to me was the worst look for the Democrats. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1142.3200000000002s)]
*  Joe Biden or Donald Trump was cognizant. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1145.4s)]
*  He was aware he was snappy. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1147.76s)]
*  He was serious, could also be light. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1149.4s)]
*  Just totally different than what Joe Biden. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1151.2800000000002s)]
*  Well, I mean, let's talk about what he did before this, before he even got to the Super [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1152.6000000000001s)]
*  Bowl. He was playing golf with Tiger Woods. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1155.72s)]
*  Yeah, that's a win by itself. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1157.44s)]
*  Is this the coolest day ever? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1159.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1161.0800000000002s)]
*  He's playing golf with Tiger Woods and his son. [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1161.6799999999998s)]
*  Then you go to the Super Bowl and do this absolutely kill an interview. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1165.32s)]
*  Well, in many ways, I felt like, OK, we are back to my childhood. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1168.52s)]
*  Sitting president gets a standing ovation, regardless of political party. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1171.9199999999998s)]
*  That's awesome. The game was a blowout like most of them in my childhood were. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1175.04s)]
*  A couple of the commercials were funny because I had to sit through several years here [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1178.6399999999999s)]
*  where I didn't laugh at a single commercial. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1182.32s)]
*  At least a couple of them were funny. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1183.9199999999998s)]
*  Because they were all telling you you were evil because you're a white man. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1185.6s)]
*  Yeah, white man. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1188.36s)]
*  And some of these were very funny. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1190.24s)]
*  But on the flip side of that, also, we still have a black national anthem, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1191.56s)]
*  which I can't believe we even have to make that statement that we've splintered so badly. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1195.1200000000001s)]
*  We have to have a completely separate national anthem. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1198.8s)]
*  And we had what, in my opinion, was a completely out of touch halftime [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1200.8s)]
*  performance, regardless if you think Kendrick Lamar, this rapper, is talented [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1204.28s)]
*  or is a great lyricist or whatever. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1208.4s)]
*  The national appeal to me doesn't justify him performing at the Super Bowl. [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1210.48s)]
*  It's the largest American event. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1215.16s)]
*  So I do want to talk about that. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1217.0s)]
*  I appreciated that there seemed to be somewhat there was red, white and blue. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1218.72s)]
*  I was like, OK, is he a patriot? [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1221.6399999999999s)]
*  I can't tell. Then there's online people speculating that no, there was actually [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1222.84s)]
*  it was like somehow a middle finger to America with Sam Jackson. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1226.6799999999998s)]
*  I don't totally understand the theories. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1231.24s)]
*  I saw red, white and blue and I liked it, but I didn't understand a word he said. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1232.8s)]
*  I didn't understand his messaging. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1237.6s)]
*  Apparently he sung the one song that was or he sang the one song [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1239.3999999999999s)]
*  that is like his big rip on Drake. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1243.6799999999998s)]
*  So that's like a personal thing. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1245.56s)]
*  I don't. Oh, we have some of it. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1247.2s)]
*  OK, let's watch. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1250.04s)]
*  I'm going to do my stuff. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1251.16s)]
*  Right. And you're not like a. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1252.3600000000001s)]
*  Ain't you tired trying to strike a cord and it's probably a minor. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1253.44s)]
*  He's suggesting Drake is a pedophile here. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1260.1200000000001s)]
*  They not like us. No, they're not. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1262.8s)]
*  The cord is probably a minor. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1264.24s)]
*  There's Serena. They're not. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1266.76s)]
*  Well, you know, they're not like us. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1268.2s)]
*  No, they're not like us. [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1269.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah. A cameo was the ex is the ex girlfriend of Drake. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1271.0800000000002s)]
*  By the way, no evidence that Drake is a pedophile whatsoever. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1275.04s)]
*  This is this is some sort of Internet thing that Kendrick Lamar put into a song. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1278.1599999999999s)]
*  They don't like each other. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1282.52s)]
*  I guess he was like sort of a protege of Drake's, but then they broke up [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1283.56s)]
*  and they don't like each other. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1286.96s)]
*  But that's a little small ball for the Super Bowl. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1287.92s)]
*  And you looked around during the performance. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1290.76s)]
*  Nobody was even paying attention. [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1293.72s)]
*  Everybody's on their phone. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1295.12s)]
*  It wasn't like it was far from like a Michael Jackson where it's like, [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1296.36s)]
*  oh, my God, right. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1300.96s)]
*  Everybody in the stadiums riveted. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1302.3999999999999s)]
*  It was like, OK. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1304.48s)]
*  Well, I mean, Megan, you know, you bring up the small ball comment. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1307.8s)]
*  And I think you're right. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1310.64s)]
*  I think something that would have been cooler is if he'd have brought Drake out [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1311.64s)]
*  during that and they would have squashed the beef and it would have been [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1315.3600000000001s)]
*  like a unifying thing and everybody would have got behind it. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1317.6s)]
*  I think that had been a much more lucrative way to go about it. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1320.1200000000001s)]
*  Now, all of a sudden, next week, [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1322.64s)]
*  y'all are dropping a remix to a song together that goes to number one [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1323.72s)]
*  in the charts because you just did it at the Super Bowl. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1326.52s)]
*  But it's this childish thing. And look, we know people do this in music. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1328.44s)]
*  They beef with each other in this, that and the other. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1331.16s)]
*  But as far as deciding to put him as the halftime show and David has three [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1332.92s)]
*  great solutions to get through the Super Bowl halftime, which I'm sure he's [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1336.68s)]
*  going to tell you here in a minute. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1339.3200000000002s)]
*  But if I can't understand the words that you're saying. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1340.4s)]
*  And when I listen to Money Trees by Kendrick Lamar and some of the other [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1342.68s)]
*  songs he does that I like, I can 100 percent understand what he's saying. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1345.5200000000002s)]
*  But he might as well have been speaking North Korean to me. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1348.6000000000001s)]
*  That's why after the first three minutes, I couldn't understand. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1351.16s)]
*  I can't go along with something. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1353.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, it was verbal braille. [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1355.3600000000001s)]
*  That what it was. That's what it was. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1357.1200000000001s)]
*  I had no idea what he was saying. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1358.48s)]
*  At the Daily Wire, he tweeted out something like, [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1359.88s)]
*  It's a beautiful voice and a beautiful accent. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1361.88s)]
*  But to be perfectly honest, I can't understand a word you're saying. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1364.72s)]
*  Live in peace. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1368.3600000000001s)]
*  The exact thing that that Trump said to that Afghanistan journalist last week. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1369.5200000000002s)]
*  He sounds like Joe Biden when he was on the debate stage. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1373.96s)]
*  I had no idea. And what's the Serena Williams? [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1376.8400000000001s)]
*  I didn't she you're married to a white guy singing a song called They're Not Like Us. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1379.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. What are you doing? [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1383.72s)]
*  And if I'm Serena Williams husband, you're gone. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1385.3200000000002s)]
*  Yeah, you're going back and dancing with your for your ex. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1387.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm not sure. Bye bye. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1390.92s)]
*  No, no, no, no. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1392.28s)]
*  And by the way, didn't her husband, didn't her husband, [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1393.28s)]
*  who was the CEO of Reddit, give up his position voluntarily [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1396.88s)]
*  to somebody who's not white? [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1402.5600000000002s)]
*  It was during the post George George Floyd, a Palooza mania [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1404.76s)]
*  where he was like, I'm too white. [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1408.88s)]
*  I'm going to give up. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1411.0800000000002s)]
*  My team's going to check me on this. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1412.04s)]
*  But I distinctly remember this story where he seeded his role [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1413.24s)]
*  for being a white guy. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1417.64s)]
*  So it's like, all right, whatever. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1418.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't know why she was there. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1420.36s)]
*  But here here here was I because I know you were asking each other on your show. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1421.7199999999998s)]
*  What did the ladies of the view think of it? [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1427.04s)]
*  Well, I've got your answer. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1428.8s)]
*  Here's what they thought. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1429.8799999999999s)]
*  Where they went in response to the halftime show. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1431.9199999999998s)]
*  I think today Donald Trump is going to sign an executive order [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1436.4799999999998s)]
*  banning black people from half time. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1439.84s)]
*  Because you remember last week we were talking about [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1442.4399999999998s)]
*  whether the NFL was capitulating to Trump by removing the term. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1446.1999999999998s)]
*  And racism from the end zone. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1450.32s)]
*  Boy, did they not capitulate to Trump. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1453.1999999999998s)]
*  When I saw Samuel L. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1456.6399999999999s)]
*  Jackson, yeah, dressed as a black uncle fan. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1458.48s)]
*  Introducing Kendrick Lamar, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1464.08s)]
*  yeah, who then had like an entire formation of all black people [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1467.1999999999998s)]
*  making a US flag and all the racists who somehow get in. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1471.0s)]
*  Man, were they hopping mad? [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1476.36s)]
*  So if the races are mad, I am happy as a clam. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1477.76s)]
*  It was so nice to see black excellence and joy in front of the sitting president [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1482.12s)]
*  who decided for the first time to go to the Super Bowl. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1485.72s)]
*  So man, Trump is upset because there were black people performing there. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1491.36s)]
*  That's that's their message. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1496.08s)]
*  The accusations of racism don't land for me when one, you just brought up [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1498.48s)]
*  Michael Jackson's performance, all time great, and two, Prince [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1502.12s)]
*  singing Purple Rain in the rain is one of the greatest half time. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1505.8799999999999s)]
*  One of the greatest concert performances that you will ever see. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1509.1999999999998s)]
*  But I have three solutions to fix the halftime show, Megan. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1512.1599999999999s)]
*  One, just let Chris Stapleton do it every single year. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1514.52s)]
*  If you already love him, you're happy. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1517.3999999999999s)]
*  If you don't already love him, congratulations, you're about to fall in love. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1519.08s)]
*  And we don't need any theatrics. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1522.04s)]
*  We don't need to run a stage out there. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1523.3999999999999s)]
*  We don't even need backup singers or a guitar. [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1525.04s)]
*  Just let him go see Broken Halos, Acapella, and that'll solve it. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1527.1599999999999s)]
*  Or Lainey Wilson, for that matter. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1530.52s)]
*  Two, we have the technology now where everyone could just pick [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1532.2s)]
*  the musical artists they want. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1535.44s)]
*  Let's have five different ones representing the major genres of music across the country. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1536.88s)]
*  If you want to listen to the hip hop one, you click that. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1541.48s)]
*  If you want to listen to the rock one, you click that. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1543.68s)]
*  Let Elon Musk come up with the details. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1545.8400000000001s)]
*  I'm just the idea guy. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1547.72s)]
*  Or three, we just get rid of it completely because high level athletes [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1549.1200000000001s)]
*  running into each other for three hours should be entertaining enough. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1553.1200000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure those are going to work, but I have to say, I don't understand [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1558.28s)]
*  how we how we make it racial. [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1561.32s)]
*  It's like maybe you like the songs, maybe you didn't. [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1562.72s)]
*  But because it was all black people out there, that's a fuck you to Trump. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1565.76s)]
*  That's an in your face. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1570.52s)]
*  And Trump must have been very upset at seeing black joy. [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1571.48s)]
*  Has there been a Republican president in modern history who has done more [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1574.6799999999998s)]
*  to reach out to black Americans, black voters, or who's gotten a greater [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1580.0s)]
*  proportion of them only to have their side call all those people Uncle Tom's. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1584.08s)]
*  Whenever a black Republican succeeds in America, they call the man or the woman [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1588.52s)]
*  and Uncle Tom as if they're some sort of a race trader. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1593.4799999999998s)]
*  And yet Anna Navarro, who, by the way, you're not black, [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1596.6399999999999s)]
*  has decided to appoint herself like defender in chief of black people. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1600.04s)]
*  She speaks for them all. I don't think so. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1603.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1606.04s)]
*  Maggie, can we just just for a second, just about the view, [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1606.6799999999998s)]
*  because what would have happened and I'm going to try and, you know, [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1610.24s)]
*  obviously watch my words here. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1613.1599999999999s)]
*  I think if we wanted to get answers from terrorists faster, [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1615.32s)]
*  we wouldn't have to waterboard them. We wouldn't have to torture them. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1618.84s)]
*  The form of torture we should actually use is to strap them to a chair [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1622.6799999999998s)]
*  and just play 24 hours straight of the view on a loop. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1625.96s)]
*  I think you would get answers to where all the terrorists are. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1629.32s)]
*  I think Hamas would be done in three weeks if we would just do that to a couple of them. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1632.04s)]
*  They tell us where everything is. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1635.76s)]
*  I break like that. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1636.9199999999998s)]
*  Hands broke out in a cold sweat. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1638.1599999999999s)]
*  But the worst part is, regardless of what would have happened at halftime, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1639.84s)]
*  if it would have been a white person singing at halftime with all mixed people behind them, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1644.0800000000002s)]
*  they would have called Donald Trump racist because a white person sang at halftime. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1648.96s)]
*  There's no winning it. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1652.64s)]
*  There's no way to appease these people because this is all they got. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1654.1200000000001s)]
*  But, Megan, here's what I'm begging all Republicans to do. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1657.8s)]
*  All pundits that go on shows, let them keep doing it. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1660.96s)]
*  They're losing and they're losing so hard. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1665.48s)]
*  It's they've been found out. Don't help them. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1667.88s)]
*  I see Mike Murphy and these guys on panels trying to tell them how to help them. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1669.96s)]
*  I come from the sports world. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1673.68s)]
*  If you're running the ball and it's not working and I'm on defense, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1675.16s)]
*  I don't go over to you at halftime and say, hey, guys, you may want to start throwing the ball. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1678.2s)]
*  We struggle against that worse. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1681.8799999999999s)]
*  Let them bury themselves. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1683.2s)]
*  Let the view keep doing it. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1685.0s)]
*  Let Margaret Brennan and all these other people keep doing it [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1686.36s)]
*  because they're going to keep going down. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1689.8s)]
*  Poor Margaret, she's her name has become the new Karen. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1692.16s)]
*  You know you're doing something wrong when your name has become the new Karen. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1694.8799999999999s)]
*  All right, let's talk about some of the ads. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1698.6s)]
*  Very interesting turns from Pfizer and from Bud Light, [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1701.36s)]
*  you know, two companies that were very much in the news over the past few years [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1707.04s)]
*  and not for the right reasons. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1711.2s)]
*  Pfizer has been, you know, paid. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1712.6s)]
*  I don't know how much you paid. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1715.24s)]
*  They paid Travis Kelsey to endorse their product. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1716.24s)]
*  Their ad, you know, name is everywhere. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1718.8799999999999s)]
*  But their reputation has really taken a hit because as they came up with the vaccine [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1721.96s)]
*  and so on. But the point is they were not open about the vaccine side effects. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1726.8799999999999s)]
*  There are many Americans who have been vaccine injured, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1731.76s)]
*  who because they struck this deal where they have this immunity for creating the [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1735.8799999999999s)]
*  vaccine, get a pittance in a settlement. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1739.08s)]
*  They get almost nothing. But Pfizer executives got very rich. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1742.0s)]
*  The company got very rich and they just keep pushing it. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1745.04s)]
*  I mean, people like that. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1748.6399999999999s)]
*  Do you know that they're on the eighth booster now? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1749.56s)]
*  That's the people who are like obsessed with the Pfizer. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1752.12s)]
*  They're on their eighth booster and they're still pushing it on 15 year old boys [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1754.52s)]
*  who are getting myocarditis, a heart infection, which is very serious. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1758.48s)]
*  And some of the heart scarring from that may never heal. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1764.48s)]
*  So, yes, many of us look at Pfizer as a villain. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1767.1599999999999s)]
*  OK, they decided to drop an ad. [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1771.8s)]
*  It had nothing to do with their vaccine. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1774.76s)]
*  They decided to go for the heartstrings, focusing on other things that Pfizer does. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1777.12s)]
*  Watch. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1783.04s)]

*  The dad. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1840.96s)]
*  Pfizer's fighting for aid cancer drugs. [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1841.64s)]
*  Was that the? Yeah. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1844.24s)]
*  I mean, it was effective. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1846.2800000000002s)]
*  It made me feel something. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  You know, a mother hugging her cancer stricken little boy, of course. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1848.2800000000002s)]
*  And the problem for Pfizer is that's only part of the story. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1852.8400000000001s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1857.0s)]
*  Yeah, look, any time you show a kid beating cancer, it pretty much makes your ad uncriticizable. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1858.44s)]
*  So congratulations to them on that. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1863.2800000000002s)]
*  But the trust factor still there for me. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1865.0s)]
*  Same with Bud Light, which I know we'll get to. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1866.96s)]

*  We just had our first child that that, you know, affects me. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1873.64s)]

*  I mean, you brought up Megan eight boosters. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1881.0s)]
*  Brad Pitt didn't need eight boosters to get cured in World War Z, [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1883.16s)]
*  let alone we need eight boosters to beat coronavirus. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1886.56s)]
*  What's World War Z? [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1890.76s)]

*  Megan, you and Doug need to watch it. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1900.84s)]

*  Thank you for supplementing my social life. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1910.56s)]
*  All right. So you mentioned the Bud Light ad, the Bud Light. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1912.84s)]
*  Bud Light has very clearly gotten the message. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1917.2s)]
*  I mean, I get it. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1919.76s)]
*  They're doing better. I'm just still so cynical about the brand. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1921.56s)]

*  You never apologized. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1925.72s)]
*  You bent the knee to the trans lobby. [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1927.12s)]
*  And the reason you never apologize, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1928.56s)]
*  because you're still on your knee to the trans lobby, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1929.8799999999999s)]
*  who are very mean and vocal. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1932.12s)]

*  To us. And you should apologize. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1936.36s)]
*  I know other people like Kid Rock disagree, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=1938.36s)]

*  The next brand that screws up, the best way to fix it [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2057.36s)]
*  is the best way to always fix it when you mess up. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2060.36s)]
*  When I mess up and don't put the napkins in the right place in the kitchen, [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2063.36s)]
*  my wife gets upset. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2066.36s)]
*  You know what I say? [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2067.36s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2068.36s)]
*  We'll be better next time. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2069.36s)]
*  If the Bud Light CEO would have came out and looked down the barrel of camera [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2070.36s)]
*  and said, look, we made a mistake in marketing. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2073.56s)]
*  I didn't have a hand in it, but it was on me. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2075.56s)]
*  I'm asking for your forgiveness. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2077.56s)]
*  And here's a... [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2079.56s)]
*  We're going to lower the price of Bud Light by a dollar [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2080.56s)]
*  or something like that for the next week or something. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2082.56s)]
*  That would have gotten you back in the good graces. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2084.56s)]
*  Because still, to this day, Megan, when I walk up to a bar, [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2086.56s)]
*  if I'm going to order a Bud Light, which I don't anymore, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2090.56s)]
*  if that thought pops in my head, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2092.56s)]
*  I look around to see how many guys are around me. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2093.56s)]
*  Because every time I say the word Bud Light, [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2095.56s)]
*  I think about Dylan Mulvaney and like a Nike outfit for women [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2097.56s)]
*  and it just gives me the chills and takes me to a stranger things place. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2101.7599999999998s)]
*  It's amazing how much money Bud Light has spent [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2105.7599999999998s)]
*  with the endorsements and the commercials and the UFC sponsorship. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2108.7599999999998s)]
*  They've spent all that money just because they can't say we were wrong [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2111.7599999999998s)]
*  or we are sorry. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2115.7599999999998s)]
*  To Megan's point, they're trying to play both sides here [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2116.7599999999998s)]
*  and now they're caught in a trap [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2119.7599999999998s)]
*  where they're trying to be everything to everybody [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2120.7599999999998s)]
*  and I'm sorry, it's just not going to work for me. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2122.7599999999998s)]
*  And you know what else they did? [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2124.7599999999998s)]
*  So they got rid of that marketing representative [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2125.7599999999998s)]
*  and somebody else on the totem pole. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2127.7599999999998s)]
*  But quietly, they didn't even do it openly. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2129.96s)]
*  It was like, oh, they're on temporary leave [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2131.96s)]
*  but they didn't attribute it to this behavior [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2134.96s)]
*  and then suddenly they left the company [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2136.96s)]
*  but they didn't attribute it to this behavior. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2138.96s)]
*  All the guy needed to do was come out to your point [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2140.96s)]
*  and say, we screwed up. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2143.96s)]
*  This is a marketing woman who went rogue [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2145.96s)]
*  and didn't understand the mission of this company. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2148.96s)]
*  She's fired and we apologize. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2150.96s)]
*  We insulted and misjudged the values of our audience [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2153.96s)]
*  of our customer base and we will work steadily [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2159.16s)]
*  to make it up to you. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2162.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2163.16s)]
*  I don't use the P word and I know the guy's a vet [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2164.16s)]
*  but he's too much of a P word to just own it [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2168.16s)]
*  and until he does that, you're not forgiven. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2171.16s)]
*  I don't forgive you and I also look at your beer [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2174.16s)]
*  as a trans bear. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2177.16s)]
*  That's it. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2178.16s)]
*  Okay, by the way, I was right about Serena Williams' husband [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2179.16s)]
*  from Harper's Bazaar June 2020. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2183.16s)]
*  Serena Williams' husband asks the Reddit board [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2186.16s)]
*  to replace him with a black candidate. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2188.3599999999997s)]
*  Alexis Ohanian has stepped down from the Reddit board [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2191.3599999999997s)]
*  in a statement regarding his decision. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2194.3599999999997s)]
*  Ohanian revealed, quote, I have urged them to fill my seat [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2196.3599999999997s)]
*  with a black candidate and I will use my future gains [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2199.3599999999997s)]
*  on my Reddit stock to serve the black community [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2202.3599999999997s)]
*  chiefly to curb racial hate [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2204.3599999999997s)]
*  and I'm starting with a pledge of $1 million [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2206.3599999999997s)]
*  to Colin Kaepernick's Know Your Rights camp. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2208.3599999999997s)]
*  Wow. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2211.3599999999997s)]
*  Williams supported her husband's decision [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2212.3599999999997s)]
*  and tweeted, having diverse views on any boards [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2214.3599999999997s)]

*  So proud of you, Alexis. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2217.56s)]
*  I know Olympia will be too. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2218.56s)]
*  Okay, that's where we were in June 2020. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2219.56s)]
*  Only rich people can do that. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2221.56s)]
*  What a little, yeah. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2222.56s)]
*  Only a rich person. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2223.56s)]

*  go, you know what, I'm the number one plumber here in Canton [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2227.56s)]

*  It sounds like. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2243.56s)]
*  Maybe it's for one of my kids or something. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2244.56s)]
*  It sounds like to me he didn't really want to work anymore. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2245.7599999999998s)]

*  It's very white savory. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2252.7599999999998s)]

*  It stinks on many levels. [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2263.7599999999998s)]
*  Okay, now there were some good ads [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2265.7599999999998s)]

*  Good monologue that isn't political, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2365.56s)]
*  plus a dog. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2367.56s)]
*  And Han Solo. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2369.56s)]
*  I'm not a mathematician, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2371.56s)]
*  but that's a pretty good formula, Kevin. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2373.56s)]
*  It made me feel proud to be an American. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2375.56s)]
*  And that's the message we need to send out to people right now. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2377.56s)]
*  You should be proud to be an American. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2380.56s)]
*  It doesn't get better than that. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2382.56s)]
*  Harrison Ford is still really cool. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2384.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe he's done a celebrity endorsement [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2386.7599999999998s)]
*  of a political candidate. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2388.7599999999998s)]
*  I don't remember it if he has. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2390.7599999999998s)]
*  He's not that outspoken on politics at a minimum. [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2392.7599999999998s)]
*  I can say that. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2394.7599999999998s)]
*  I think I would have noticed. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2396.7599999999998s)]
*  But I must tell you, even if he were, [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2398.7599999999998s)]
*  I would totally forgive and love him. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2400.7599999999998s)]
*  I just think he's so cool. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2402.7599999999998s)]
*  He's transcended all that stuff for me. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2404.7599999999998s)]
*  Yes, Star Wars. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2406.7599999999998s)]
*  Everybody loves him from Star Wars. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2408.7599999999998s)]
*  That's more a guy thing, to be perfectly honest. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2410.7599999999998s)]
*  For a woman, it's the working-girl character that he played. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2412.96s)]
*  There's never been anybody cuter. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2416.96s)]
*  He was adorbs. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2418.96s)]
*  And he's got this great combination [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2420.96s)]
*  of being relatable, but also very sexy. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2422.96s)]
*  And as he gets older, he's not dying his hair. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2424.96s)]
*  His voice is getting kind of gravelly. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2426.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2428.96s)]
*  He's entered a different phase of cool. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2430.96s)]
*  And Jeep was very smart to get him to endorse their product [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2432.96s)]
*  and to do all of that. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2436.96s)]
*  And I think that's the biggest thing [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2438.96s)]
*  to endorse their product and to do all the imagery [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2441.16s)]
*  that you guys just talked about. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2443.16s)]
*  Even if it's subtle, you get what they're saying. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2445.16s)]
*  Like, we're back. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2447.16s)]
*  America is back, baby. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2449.16s)]
*  And Jeep is on board for it. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2451.16s)]
*  Okay, so I see why you loved it. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2453.16s)]
*  Thank you for bringing it to my attention. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2455.16s)]
*  The next one my team tells me you guys enjoyed [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2457.16s)]
*  was the Uber Eats ad. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2459.16s)]
*  Here it is, stop 14. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2461.16s)]
*  From the very beginning, football has been a conspiracy [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2463.16s)]
*  to make us hungry. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2465.16s)]
*  And we'll call this a pigskin. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2467.16s)]
*  Bacon. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2469.3599999999997s)]
*  And everybody loves bacon. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2470.3599999999997s)]
*  They'd do anything to sell food. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2472.3599999999997s)]
*  Coach, how come we only play on Sundays? [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2474.3599999999997s)]
*  Because nobody's eating ice cream Saturdays, kid. [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2476.3599999999997s)]
*  So the Packers were named after Meat Packers. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2478.3599999999997s)]
*  So what's one called the fans, Coach? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2480.3599999999997s)]
*  Cheeseheads. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2484.3599999999997s)]
*  Of course. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2486.3599999999997s)]
*  Why do you think Buffalo got a team? [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2488.3599999999997s)]
*  These wings deserve a team. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2490.3599999999997s)]
*  They've got a good team name for Buffalo, Bill. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2492.3599999999997s)]
*  Buffalo. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2494.3599999999997s)]
*  In their biggest game? [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2496.3599999999997s)]
*  They'll be a Super Cup. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2498.36s)]
*  Can't eat out of a cup, Ted. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2500.36s)]
*  But a bowl? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2502.36s)]
*  How about a Super Bowl? [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2504.36s)]
*  And we'll start them in players after appliances. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2506.36s)]
*  Hey, Coach, do I have to be called refrigerator? [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2510.36s)]
*  Yes. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2512.36s)]
*  And Peyton, he was a beef salesman. Omaha! [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2514.36s)]
*  Steak. Omaha! [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2516.36s)]
*  No one believes that football is just some conspiracy to sell food. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2518.36s)]
*  When football makes you hungry, order Uber Eats. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2522.36s)]
*  That's very clever. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2524.36s)]
*  Well done. [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2526.36s)]
*  Everything you just said about Harrison Ford, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2528.36s)]
*  everything you just said about Harrison Ford a minute ago, [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2530.36s)]
*  copy and paste to Matthew McConaughey. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2532.36s)]
*  Effortlessly cool. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2534.36s)]
*  I mean, is he our generations, [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2536.36s)]
*  a younger generation's Harrison Ford? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2538.36s)]
*  I mean, yeah, look, Matthew McConaughey, [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2540.36s)]
*  his versatility is incredible. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2542.36s)]
*  But, you know, Megan, this is like the culmination [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2544.36s)]
*  of a bunch of other commercials that they've done [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2546.36s)]
*  with Matthew McConaughey talking about food [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2548.36s)]
*  that have all been funny. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2550.36s)]
*  So this was like the mea culpa a habit to the end. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2552.36s)]
*  He did one with Woody Harrelson that I enjoyed. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2554.36s)]
*  It's fantastic. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2556.36s)]
*  So I think it's original, too. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2558.36s)]
*  I'm the biggest football fan in the world. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2560.36s)]
*  I would have never made that connection. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2562.36s)]
*  So the originality, Matthew McConaughey being funny, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2564.36s)]
*  and then going through the different eras of football [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2566.36s)]
*  all the way back to the first game [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2568.36s)]
*  to kind of modern day with Peyton Manning, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2570.36s)]
*  I just thought it was absolutely perfectly put together. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2572.36s)]
*  And it's funny. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2574.36s)]
*  It's originally funny and not forced, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2576.36s)]
*  which I think is money. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2578.36s)]
*  I saw a quick clip of Matthew McConaughey. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2580.36s)]
*  I don't even know what it was from. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2582.36s)]
*  But I think he is from Texas. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2584.36s)]
*  And the interviewer is like, how you doing? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2586.36s)]
*  And he goes, just trying to get my eight seconds [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2588.36s)]
*  on the bull like everyone else. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2590.36s)]
*  All right, all right, all right. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2592.36s)]
*  Half his commercials, at least I understood [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2594.36s)]
*  what he was saying in that one. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2596.36s)]
*  When he does the Escalade commercials, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2598.36s)]
*  he's just talking in nonsensical quips. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2600.36s)]
*  And it still works. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2602.36s)]
*  And it's close to the Kendrick Lamar. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2604.36s)]
*  That's how you know you've got talent. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2606.36s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2608.36s)]
*  All right, what did you think, Blaine? [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2610.36s)]
*  I thought it was kind of the same thing. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2612.36s)]
*  I echo what Jake said. It's kind of a different train of thought [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2614.36s)]
*  when it comes to sports, which is creative and cool [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2616.36s)]
*  and it's clever. And any time you put together [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2618.36s)]
*  football, food, and Matthew McConaughey, [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2620.36s)]
*  I mean, that's basically the triple X right there. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2622.36s)]
*  That's a trifecta. I'll buy whatever from Uber Eats. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2624.36s)]
*  Hell, at this point, I'm pretty close [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2626.36s)]
*  to buying Uber Eats and a Jeep. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2628.36s)]
*  And there's no wonk messaging. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2630.36s)]
*  Just straightforward, to the point, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2632.36s)]
*  highlighted your product like you said, [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2634.36s)]
*  and made me laugh. Yeah, that's all it takes. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2636.36s)]
*  Can I just say, Uber Eats, something so funny [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2638.36s)]
*  about Uber Eats, I was just remarking [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2640.36s)]
*  on this to my husband the other day. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2642.36s)]
*  Our 15-year-old had some buddies over [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2644.36s)]
*  and it was like maybe 5 o'clock [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2646.36s)]
*  in the afternoon and two of them are sitting [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2648.36s)]
*  there eating burgers and fries. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2650.36s)]
*  I did not get anybody burgers and fries. [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2652.36s)]
*  And they'd been at my house for a couple of hours. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2654.36s)]
*  I'm like, where'd you guys get it? They're like, oh, we Uber Eats'd it. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2656.36s)]
*  I'm like, you no longer [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2658.36s)]
*  have to provide, you know, [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2660.36s)]
*  as the homemaker. You don't have to provide [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2662.36s)]
*  for anybody. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2664.36s)]
*  Well, when my wife was pregnant, I mean, we probably [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2666.36s)]
*  had the Uber Eats stock go up about 70% [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2668.36s)]
*  for the last four months of that. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2670.36s)]
*  So it's always a winner. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2672.36s)]
*  And I mean, you don't even have to go to the drive-thru. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2674.36s)]
*  I think drive-thrus may be hurting a little bit [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2676.36s)]
*  like the old school drive-thrus, because you don't even have to go [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2678.36s)]
*  to the drive-thru anymore. They'll just bring it to the house. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2680.36s)]
*  There's something about people delivering your food that just hits different. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2682.36s)]
*  It does hit different. It just hits different. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2684.36s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm a big fan now. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2686.36s)]
*  I did wind up feeding them again later. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2688.36s)]
*  But man, Uber, thank you for the assist. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2690.36s)]
*  Guys, thank you for the assist. I appreciate it. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2692.36s)]
*  And enjoy the show. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2694.36s)]
*  Thanks so much for having us, Megan. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2696.36s)]
*  It's always a pleasure to come on here. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2698.36s)]
*  And glad you had a good time at the Super Bowl. Maybe we'll see you out there next year. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2700.36s)]
*  They're like, they're my translators. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2702.36s)]
*  They translate sports into news speak [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2704.36s)]
*  so I can understand it. Well done. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2706.36s)]
*  And the best part is, [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2722.36s)]
*  Berna is the choice for so many. [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2724.36s)]
*  Berna is a game-changing, less lethal [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2726.36s)]
*  self-defense tool. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2728.36s)]
*  Compact, powerful, and easy to use. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2730.36s)]
*  It provides the confidence to act in any situation. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2732.36s)]
*  Berna uses [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2734.36s)]
*  non-lethal rounds, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2736.36s)]
*  tear gas, pepper, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2738.36s)]
*  and kinetic projectiles [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2740.36s)]
*  to effectively stop a threat [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2742.36s)]
*  from a safe distance. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2744.36s)]
*  And the best part is, Berna can be shipped [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2746.36s)]
*  direct to your door, and it's legal in all 50 states. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2748.36s)]
*  The only thing about somebody who doesn't practice with firearms all the time [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2750.36s)]
*  is you don't even have to have the best aim. [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2752.36s)]
*  If you can hit the wall [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2754.36s)]
*  right behind the intruder [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2756.36s)]
*  or the bad guy, you could potentially [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2758.36s)]
*  incapacitate him with [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2760.36s)]
*  what's essentially like a chemical weapon [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2762.36s)]
*  in this projectile. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2764.36s)]
*  So you don't actually have to hit the guy [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2766.36s)]
*  as long as you get it really close to him. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2768.36s)]
*  It could take him out for the next hour, which is the time you need [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2770.36s)]
*  to protect yourself. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2772.36s)]
*  Berna is proudly American with products [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2774.36s)]
*  hand-assembled in Fort Wayne, Indiana. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2776.36s)]
*  Sometimes a firearm is not the right option for you. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2778.36s)]
*  And Berna provides a powerful [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2780.36s)]
*  alternative. Protect what matters most [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2782.36s)]

*  now that our guests are gone. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2870.36s)]
*  Not that it needed to wait. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2872.36s)]
*  But I wanted to say [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2874.36s)]
*  something about Harrison Ford. I've been meaning [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2876.36s)]
*  to mention this to you. So everybody [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2878.36s)]
*  saw the movie Presumed [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2880.36s)]
*  Innocent, right? Or read the book by Scott [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2882.36s)]
*  Turow. If you haven't, please do both. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2884.36s)]
*  The movie came out years and years [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2886.36s)]
*  ago. It starred Harrison Ford [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2888.36s)]
*  as an embattled prosecutor [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2890.36s)]
*  who winds up [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2892.36s)]
*  accused in the death [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2894.36s)]
*  of his mistress. And it's [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2896.36s)]
*  just an amazing, well [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2898.36s)]
*  written, well done [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2900.36s)]
*  book and movie. And [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2902.36s)]
*  Harrison Ford's amazing in it. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2904.36s)]
*  So then this past summer [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2906.36s)]
*  they came out with the Netflix like [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2908.36s)]
*  redo of Presumed Innocent [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2910.36s)]
*  as a series, like a six [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2912.36s)]
*  episode series. And it was written [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2914.36s)]
*  I think Scott Turow [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2916.36s)]
*  consulted, but it was written this one [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2918.36s)]
*  by David E. Kelly, the guy who wrote [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2920.36s)]
*  The Practice and [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2922.36s)]
*  Big Little Lies. And I mean he's [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2924.36s)]
*  one of our best television writers. He also happens to be [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2926.36s)]
*  married to Michelle Pfeiffer. So he wrote [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2928.36s)]
*  it and Jake Gyllenhaal [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2930.36s)]
*  starred in it. It was really well done [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2932.36s)]
*  and it was very different from [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2934.36s)]
*  the original. He went way off the book [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2936.36s)]
*  but also came up with a [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2938.36s)]
*  bunch of clever twists and my [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2940.36s)]
*  whole family enjoyed it. We were on the edge of our seats [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2942.36s)]
*  the whole six episodes. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2944.36s)]
*  So just now Scott Turow has dropped his [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2946.36s)]
*  sequel. It's like one of the sequels. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2948.36s)]
*  I guess it's like the second sequel to [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2950.36s)]
*  Presumed Innocent and it's called Presumed Guilty. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2952.36s)]
*  And I listen to my [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2954.36s)]
*  books. I don't really read them. I just, I read so much [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2956.36s)]
*  for the show. I like to spare my eyes. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2958.36s)]
*  So I listen to the whole thing on audiobook [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2960.36s)]
*  and I loved the audiobook. I want [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2962.36s)]
*  you to know this. I loved the audiobook of [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2964.36s)]
*  Presumed Guilty. The guy who reads [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2966.36s)]
*  it, forgive me I don't have his name in front of me, [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2968.36s)]
*  he sounds like he's like [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2970.36s)]
*  a guy who like [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2972.36s)]
*  you know maybe was kind of waspy, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2974.36s)]
*  drinks scotch at night [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2976.36s)]
*  and is just sick of the bullshit. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2978.36s)]
*  You know that's just how he sounds to me. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2980.36s)]
*  Like just sort of a no-nonsense dude [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2982.36s)]
*  who's like this is the way [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2984.36s)]
*  the world is. Now Scott [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2986.36s)]
*  is a Democrat and there's like [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2988.36s)]
*  there's a little, he's not woke, there's a little [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2990.36s)]
*  touch of those like messages in there. I don't care. [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2992.36s)]
*  I think he's brilliant. I really [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2994.36s)]
*  really enjoyed it. And [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2996.36s)]
*  I think you might enjoy the read of [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=2998.36s)]
*  Presumed Guilty. But I'm just [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3000.36s)]
*  going to tell you another thing. So it got me [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3002.36s)]
*  on a Scott Turow path. And [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3004.36s)]
*  I didn't realize he did [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3006.36s)]
*  write a sequel to Presumed [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3008.36s)]
*  Innocent called Innocent. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3010.36s)]
*  And it involves all the same [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3012.36s)]
*  characters as the first [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3014.36s)]
*  book. And I'm listening to that [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3016.36s)]
*  on audio tape right now. And I [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3018.36s)]
*  cannot put it down. It's so [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3020.36s)]
*  good. Don't know how it's going to end. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3022.36s)]
*  You know bear with me. But if you're looking [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3024.36s)]
*  for something, if you like legal thrillers [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3026.36s)]
*  as I do, I think you'll [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3028.36s)]

*  as an actor. You can write it for the next [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3048.36s)]
*  several decades if you [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3050.36s)]
*  at least connect to somebody [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3052.36s)]

*  So there you go. My [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3056.36s)]
*  entertainment recommendations for [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3058.36s)]
*  the day. Okay. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3060.36s)]
*  I want to get to [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3062.36s)]
*  what happened. There's so much news, but we'll talk [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3064.36s)]
*  about it tomorrow. We have a full show for you tomorrow. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3066.36s)]
*  I mean I went [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3068.36s)]
*  I went over [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3070.36s)]
*  I was in the YouTube box [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3072.36s)]
*  and met a lot of absolutely [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3074.36s)]
*  lovely people. Such accomplished people [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3076.36s)]
*  who were so like in good [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3078.36s)]
*  humor and down to earth. The one guy who [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3080.36s)]
*  owns [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3082.36s)]
*  Tinder and Match.com [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3084.36s)]
*  and another guy who runs Pinterest. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3086.36s)]
*  Super sweet guys [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3088.36s)]
*  who absolutely [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3090.36s)]
*  know heirs about them. [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3092.36s)]
*  You would never have known that they run these very [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3094.36s)]
*  big powerful companies. Just very cool people. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3096.36s)]
*  Really enjoyed our time with these guys. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3098.36s)]
*  Then I got up. I told you about [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3100.36s)]
*  Lainey Wilson, star, [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3102.36s)]
*  the nicest. Had a deep conversation with her [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3104.36s)]
*  about God and religion [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3106.36s)]
*  and where she's at and where I'm at. Really [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3108.36s)]
*  really loved. She sent me some great [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3110.36s)]
*  recommendations including a Sean Ryan [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3112.36s)]
*  podcast she really loved. We both are big [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3114.36s)]
*  friends or big fans of [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3116.36s)]
*  Sean Ryan. [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3118.36s)]
*  So then I was trying [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3120.36s)]
*  to use the ladies room and something [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3122.36s)]
*  very funny happened. I went out [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3124.36s)]
*  I told you where I was in relation to Taylor [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3126.36s)]
*  Swift. Well I [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3128.36s)]
*  walk out the box, the suite, and [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3130.36s)]
*  there's the dress. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3132.36s)]
*  The lady in a dress that signifies [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3134.36s)]
*  this is the women's room. So I go [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3136.36s)]
*  and there's a woman standing there. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3138.36s)]
*  I of course just assumed there's a line. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3140.36s)]
*  And I'm like [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3142.36s)]
*  are you in line? And she's like [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3144.36s)]
*  no. I'm like oh okay [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3146.36s)]
*  so I go to get past her. And she's like oh no [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3148.36s)]
*  I think someone's in there. I'm like [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3150.36s)]
*  one person? [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3152.36s)]
*  I'm like oh. She's like [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3154.36s)]
*  there was something unclear about what [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3156.36s)]
*  she said so I tried to go past [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3158.36s)]
*  her and then I pressed down the [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3160.36s)]
*  doorknob and it started to open. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3162.36s)]
*  And I heard like oh. And she was like oh [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3164.36s)]
*  no no. And then I realized Taylor [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3166.36s)]
*  Swift was clearly in there and this was like [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3168.36s)]
*  a privacy guard for her. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3170.36s)]
*  So I think I [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3172.36s)]
*  almost walked in on Taylor Swift in [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3174.36s)]
*  the bathroom. And I'm really [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3176.36s)]
*  glad that did not happen. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3178.36s)]
*  Really, really glad. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3180.36s)]
*  So then I realized it was just one of those [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3182.36s)]
*  one stall bathrooms and I found the [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3184.36s)]
*  actual women's room which is where I went. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3186.36s)]
*  It was fine. But [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3188.36s)]
*  on my way to [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3190.36s)]
*  try to find the women's room I actually [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3192.36s)]
*  ran into Donald Trump Jr. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3194.36s)]
*  And he's such [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3196.36s)]
*  a sweetheart. I have to say he's really [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3198.36s)]
*  one of my favorite people. I have never [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3200.36s)]
*  seen him where he is anything [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3202.36s)]
*  other than totally magnanimous, [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3204.36s)]
*  kind, warm. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3206.36s)]
*  What do you need? [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3208.36s)]
*  What do you need to know? How can I [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3210.36s)]
*  be of help to you? [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3212.36s)]
*  Just like the most [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3214.36s)]
*  genuine, likeable guy. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3216.36s)]
*  Truly, I'm a huge fan of his. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3218.36s)]
*  And he was with his new girlfriend who I met [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3220.36s)]
*  who was stunning. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3222.36s)]
*  Stunning. She's like super [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3224.36s)]
*  tall and you know you're [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3226.36s)]
*  taken aback by the beauty coming [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3228.36s)]
*  at you down the hall. She was [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3230.36s)]
*  super gracious. Very nice person. [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3232.36s)]
*  And they're going the other way. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3234.36s)]
*  I'm going this way. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3236.36s)]
*  And he said, have you seen my dad? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3238.36s)]
*  I was like no I haven't seen him. And he's like [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3240.36s)]
*  do you want to say hi? And of course I want to say hi to the [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3242.36s)]
*  president. It was [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3244.36s)]
*  out of his way. He was leaving the suite. They [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3246.36s)]
*  were walking like halfway down the hall by the time he [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3248.36s)]
*  offers me this. He sees me. He [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3250.36s)]
*  turns back around to take me back [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3252.36s)]
*  into the suite. That's very kind. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3254.36s)]
*  He's like with an entourage. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3256.36s)]
*  Really appreciated it. Go [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3258.36s)]
*  in there. It's like a who's who of you know [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3260.36s)]
*  Republican politics in there. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3262.36s)]
*  Got to meet Caroline Levitt. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3264.36s)]
*  That was a highlight. His press secretary. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3266.36s)]
*  27 year old [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3268.36s)]
*  star. And of course this [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3270.36s)]
*  is a picture of yours truly with the president, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3272.36s)]
*  with Don Jr. And with Steve Scalise. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3274.36s)]
*  Total patriot. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3276.36s)]
*  Of course took a bullet from [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3278.36s)]
*  a lunatic who [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3280.36s)]
*  was outraged over things he'd heard on Rachel [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3282.36s)]
*  Maddow's show but really was just a lunatic. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3284.36s)]
*  And has gone on to [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3286.36s)]
*  just do wonders in the Republican [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3288.36s)]
*  Party. Very loyal to the president. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3290.36s)]
*  Close ally. So I enjoyed [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3292.36s)]
*  meeting with Caroline. She's crushing it. Do you know she has [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3294.36s)]
*  a baby. She has a baby. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3296.36s)]
*  A one year old who is [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3298.36s)]
*  a little boy. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3300.36s)]
*  And she is of course having all [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3302.36s)]
*  the struggles of new motherhood. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3304.36s)]
*  While she's on the road constantly with [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3306.36s)]
*  President Trump but she's finding a balance. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3308.36s)]
*  What she's doing is a service to her country. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3310.36s)]
*  She's I think truly just a [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3312.36s)]
*  patriot. She loves Trump. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3314.36s)]
*  She loves the country. And [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3316.36s)]
*  I think she's correct that she can find a balance. [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3318.36s)]
*  Even though she's got a baby right now. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3320.36s)]
*  Between serving her [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3322.36s)]
*  country and the president and taking care [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3324.36s)]
*  of her little boy. She's got a very supportive husband too. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3326.36s)]
*  So say a prayer for Caroline. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3328.36s)]
*  That's a big challenge and I think she's doing a [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3330.36s)]
*  wonderful job. Got to spend [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3332.36s)]
*  some time with Katie Britt. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3334.36s)]
*  Who was there with her son. Her teenage son. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3336.36s)]
*  14 year old freshman in high school. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3338.36s)]
*  What a doll. I told him how cool his [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3340.36s)]
*  mom is. She's there. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3342.36s)]
*  Taking her son to the Super Bowl. Hello. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3344.36s)]
*  That's I mean what a anyway. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3346.36s)]
*  So Eric Schmidt [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3348.36s)]
*  former Attorney General of [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3350.36s)]
*  Missouri who now is the [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3352.36s)]
*  Senator from the state. He's been doing great work [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3354.36s)]
*  on so many issues that are near and dear to all [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3356.36s)]
*  of our hearts. The whole thing was [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3358.36s)]
*  just such a uplifting tour. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3360.36s)]
*  Right. Like you walk through and you see [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3362.36s)]
*  this person to whom you're grateful and that person [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3364.36s)]
*  to whom you're grateful. The president was next to his daughter [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3366.36s)]
*  Ivanka who has been far [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3368.36s)]
*  less in the public eye this time [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3370.36s)]
*  around. But is a total [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3372.36s)]
*  class act. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3374.36s)]
*  She's just you know she and Jared [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3376.36s)]
*  I think decided to recede [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3378.36s)]
*  from political life because they just got [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3380.36s)]
*  completely battered and bruised [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3382.36s)]
*  first. They all did. I mean Don Jr. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3384.36s)]
*  always says he's the most subpoenaed person in US history. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3386.36s)]
*  Eric Trump too. Same. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3388.36s)]
*  Laura Trump is more outspoken [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3390.36s)]
*  and she enjoys that. But not everybody [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3392.36s)]
*  wants the downside of what comes [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3394.36s)]
*  with putting yourself out there [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3396.36s)]
*  when it comes to politics. And I think [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3398.36s)]
*  Jared and Ivanka. I think [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3400.36s)]
*  they're there for the president but maybe just don't want [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3402.36s)]
*  that to be the pointy part of the [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3404.36s)]
*  spear like their dad. As she was [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3406.36s)]
*  next to the president looked [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3408.36s)]
*  luminous, totally [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3410.36s)]
*  warm and the whole all the family. I [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3412.36s)]
*  think their natural closeness with one another [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3414.36s)]
*  leads to like an inner [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3416.36s)]
*  joy. I do. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3418.36s)]
*  I mean they're extremely close. They're extremely loyal to one [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3420.36s)]
*  another. They know they have that sort of wolf [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3422.36s)]
*  pack. And I think if you build [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3424.36s)]
*  that same dynamic in your own family [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3426.36s)]
*  you'll have the same [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3428.36s)]
*  closeness with your kids. You'll have the same [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3430.36s)]
*  camaraderie even when they're all adults [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3432.36s)]
*  and they're already producing the next generation. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3434.36s)]
*  So anyway, had a great [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3436.36s)]
*  chat with the president. [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3438.36s)]
*  After I left him he banned the penny. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3440.36s)]
*  Or maybe [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3442.36s)]
*  it was right before. I don't know if he banned the penny [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3444.36s)]
*  last night because apparently [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3446.36s)]
*  it cost more than two cents [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3448.36s)]
*  to make one cent. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3450.36s)]
*  Trump said this makes no sense. [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3452.36s)]
*  So we're not making [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3454.36s)]
*  pennies anymore. I've got to say [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3456.36s)]
*  thumbs up. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3458.36s)]
*  It was the least of what he did over the weekend and we'll [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3460.36s)]
*  talk about all of that in more detail tomorrow. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3462.36s)]
*  But I think the [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3464.36s)]
*  overall sentiment I got from Team Trump [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3466.36s)]
*  was that they are thrilled [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3468.36s)]
*  that the fight [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3470.36s)]
*  the left is choosing to pick [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3472.36s)]
*  is over the [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3474.36s)]
*  firing of bureaucrats. The jobs [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3476.36s)]
*  of bureaucrats. Boohoo! [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3478.36s)]
*  A bureaucrat got fired. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3480.36s)]
*  A bureaucrat has lost their [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3482.36s)]
*  lifetime employment on the public [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3484.36s)]
*  dime. They accurately deduce [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3486.36s)]
*  that that is not going to tug on anybody's [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3488.36s)]
*  heartstrings. No one's. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3490.36s)]
*  And you know Trump said to Brett Bear [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3492.36s)]
*  I ran on this. I [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3494.36s)]
*  ran on. I told people I was going [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3496.36s)]
*  to do this. And [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3498.36s)]
*  you know [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3500.36s)]
*  Brett brought up with him, well you [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3502.36s)]
*  know some people say whatever, Elon's in there [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3504.36s)]
*  with his team of [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3506.36s)]
*  you know tech bros and [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3508.36s)]
*  they're looking at things they shouldn't be looking at [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3510.36s)]
*  and you know what's, is he [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3512.36s)]
*  looking up his competitors private data? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3514.36s)]
*  Like what's he doing? It's like what reason [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3516.36s)]
*  do you have to distrust him, right? And here [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3518.36s)]
*  is Trump defending Elon for what it's worth. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3520.36s)]
*  I don't know if it's kickbacks or what's [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3522.36s)]
*  going on but the people, look I ran [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3524.36s)]
*  on this and the people want [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3526.36s)]
*  me to find it and I've had a great [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3528.36s)]
*  help with Elon Musk who's [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3530.36s)]
*  been terrific. Tomlind you say [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3532.36s)]
*  you trust him? Trust Elon? [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3534.36s)]
*  Oh, he's not gaining anything. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3536.36s)]
*  In fact I wonder how he can devote the time [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3538.36s)]
*  to it. He's so into it. But I [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3540.36s)]
*  told him do that. Then I'm going to tell him [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3542.36s)]
*  very soon, like maybe [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3544.36s)]
*  in 24 hours, to go [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3546.36s)]
*  check the Department of Education. [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3548.36s)]
*  He's going to find the same thing. Then I'm going to [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3550.36s)]
*  go to the military. Let's check the military. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3552.36s)]
*  We're going to find billions, [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3554.36s)]
*  hundreds of billions of dollars of [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3556.36s)]
*  fraud and abuse. And [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3558.36s)]
*  you know the people elected me on that. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3560.36s)]
*  100% right. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3564.36s)]
*  And that's been one of the [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3566.36s)]
*  things all along. We are so lucky we have Elon [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3568.36s)]
*  Musk willing to work for us, willing [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3570.36s)]
*  to bring this tech team in there to [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3572.36s)]
*  kick the tires of these agencies and see [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3574.36s)]
*  who's wasting our money [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3576.36s)]
*  with a bunch of fraudulent [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3578.36s)]
*  kickback schemes to their left [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3580.36s)]
*  wing buddies. And the answer [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3582.36s)]
*  is a lot. A lot of people are. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3584.36s)]
*  There have been some activist judges [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3586.36s)]
*  trying to slow it down or stop it. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3588.36s)]
*  I am very confident [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3590.36s)]
*  that the executive branch will [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3592.36s)]
*  see its powers upheld [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3594.36s)]
*  once these cases go up in appeal. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3596.36s)]
*  There's one Trump appointed [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3598.36s)]
*  judge who slowed [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3600.36s)]
*  some of the layoffs that he's going to be doing, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3602.36s)]
*  the federal workers. That's going to get resolved. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3604.36s)]
*  He just said, we're going to have a hearing [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3606.36s)]
*  on it. I don't think that's a real [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3608.36s)]
*  win for the Trump challengers. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3610.36s)]
*  He's just saying, let's slow it down [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3612.36s)]
*  until we can actually have a hearing and I can hear [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3614.36s)]
*  the issues briefed. Their argument [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3616.36s)]
*  is you can't lay them off with eight months [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3618.36s)]
*  of pay promise because [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3620.36s)]
*  they're only guaranteed [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3622.36s)]
*  pay through March. And so no one has [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3624.36s)]
*  the power to authorize them [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3626.36s)]
*  pay for the next eight months. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3628.36s)]
*  So we'll work that out. These people are going [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3630.36s)]
*  to go. They're taking the voluntary buyout [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3632.36s)]
*  and some are getting fired. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3634.36s)]
*  Anyway, I really [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3636.36s)]
*  have faith that Trump does have the executive [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3638.36s)]
*  powers that he's saying he does [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3640.36s)]
*  and that in nine out of ten of these [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3642.36s)]
*  cases he'll win. I mean, it could be ten out [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3644.36s)]
*  of ten, but I actually took a hard look at most of [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3646.36s)]
*  them and thought his executive power seems very [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3648.36s)]
*  much intact. These are just people who can't [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3650.36s)]
*  deal with reality. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3652.36s)]
*  Deb, do we have the sound bite of the [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3654.36s)]
*  bureaucrat [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3656.36s)]
*  upset? Is it with? Yeah, it's with [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3658.36s)]
*  Margaret Brennan. Speaking of Brian, [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3660.36s)]
*  so this is, I don't know [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3662.36s)]
*  why Margaret Brennan has [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3664.36s)]
*  decided to absolutely ruin her career. First [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3666.36s)]
*  with that vice presidential debate [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3668.36s)]
*  and with her JD Vance interviews. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3670.36s)]
*  Just the pathetic nature [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3672.36s)]
*  of her journalism in general. And now [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3674.36s)]
*  she and CBS News decide this [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3676.36s)]
*  is the place to go with the story, like the story [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3678.36s)]
*  of the Trump presidency, which by the way [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3680.36s)]
*  we talk about that poll mentioned in passing. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3682.36s)]
*  Trump's poll right now, the latest poll [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3684.36s)]
*  has him up six [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3686.36s)]
*  on his approval rating since he was [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3688.36s)]
*  elected. He's at 53 [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3690.36s)]
*  percent, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3692.36s)]
*  47 percent disapproved. [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3694.36s)]
*  53 percent is high for President Trump. [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3696.36s)]
*  He, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3698.36s)]
*  yeah, it's across the board. [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3700.36s)]
*  I mean, several polls. Quinnipiac [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3702.36s)]
*  has him up three. Emerson has him up eight. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3704.36s)]
*  Pew's [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3706.36s)]
*  got him down four. That's an outlier. The Economist [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3708.36s)]
*  has him up six. CBS has him up six. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3710.36s)]
*  The people like what Trump is doing. [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3712.36s)]
*  Across age groups. [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3714.36s)]
*  The breakdown of the demographics on the approval [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3716.36s)]
*  rating, ages 18 to 29, he's up 10 [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3718.36s)]
*  with them versus approval versus disapproval. [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3720.36s)]
*  30 to 44, up four. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3722.36s)]
*  Gen X, 45 to 64, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3724.36s)]
*  up 12. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3726.36s)]
*  And with the boomers, he's even. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3728.36s)]
*  I mean, he's crushing it. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3730.36s)]
*  There's a reason he's crushing it, because as he said, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3732.36s)]
*  he's doing all the things that he said [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3734.36s)]
*  he was going to do. But Margaret Brennan [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3736.36s)]
*  didn't get the memo. Margaret Brennan decided [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3738.36s)]
*  what we need to do is really highlight the stories [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3740.36s)]
*  of the poor federal [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3742.36s)]
*  bureaucrats who don't want [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3744.36s)]
*  to be fired. Here is [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3746.36s)]
*  SOT20. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3748.36s)]
*  We spoke with a 10-year veteran of USAID [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3750.36s)]
*  who asked to stay [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3752.36s)]
*  anonymous out of fear for their family [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3754.36s)]
*  member's safety. Civil servants [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3756.36s)]
*  are at their core, [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3758.36s)]
*  sworn to uphold [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3760.36s)]
*  the rules of our government, of our [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3762.36s)]
*  Constitution, and to serve each [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3764.36s)]
*  incoming administration. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3766.36s)]
*  My personal politics don't play a role. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3768.36s)]
*  It isn't clear why this sliver [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3770.36s)]
*  of spending, less than 1% [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3772.36s)]
*  of the federal budget, is the first focus [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3774.36s)]
*  of this so-called efficiency project. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3776.36s)]
*  But it feels like a demolition, [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3778.36s)]
*  perhaps a preview of the [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3780.36s)]
*  future for other public servants. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3782.36s)]
*  Please pay attention [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3784.36s)]
*  to USAID. This might [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3786.36s)]
*  not affect you right now, but it will tomorrow. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3788.36s)]
*  It's a way to make us feel sympathy by making your guest sound like a monster. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3790.36s)]
*  The voice modulation is disturbing. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3792.36s)]
*  Right? What is that? My God. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3794.36s)]
*  No one feels sorry for the federal bureaucrats. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3796.36s)]
*  Sorry, they just don't. They're more worried about their own lives and their own jobs. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3798.36s)]
*  And none of us has lifetime tenure. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3800.36s)]
*  Like, unless you're a Supreme Court justice [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3802.36s)]
*  or a federal judge, you don't have lifetime tenure. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3804.36s)]
*  Why do you think you're not going to have lifetime tenure? [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3806.36s)]

*  I've got to earn it. I don't feel sorry for you. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3824.36s)]

*  Why am I paying for that? [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3842.36s)]
*  That was at the B-roll. Oh, we're starving children. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3844.36s)]

*  He's trying to cause the death of little children. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3848.36s)]

*  Do you? [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3872.36s)]
*  All right. So, [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3874.36s)]
*  he's just starting with USAID, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3876.36s)]
*  and that one's not done. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3878.36s)]

*  That's long past [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3922.36s)]

*  other than go on MSNBC and rip on Trump? [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3954.36s)]
*  Why does he need a security clearance? [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3956.36s)]
*  And here's my personal [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3958.36s)]
*  favorite, Attorney Mark Zaid. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3960.36s)]
*  He so [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3962.36s)]
*  deserves it. Attorney Mark [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3964.36s)]
*  Zaid, who went to Albany Law School, [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3966.36s)]
*  like me. And I used to like the guy. [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3968.36s)]
*  And then, of course, [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3970.36s)]
*  he started to publicly attack me [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3972.36s)]
*  when I didn't hate Trump. And he got [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3974.36s)]
*  very upset about that and started [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3976.36s)]
*  all of his nonsense. Even though I had [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3978.36s)]
*  defended him on Twitter, but he showed that I was wrong [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3980.36s)]
*  in my defense. He is a partisan hack. [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3982.36s)]
*  And he makes his whole business by defending [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3984.36s)]
*  these CIA whistleblowers. [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3986.36s)]
*  He's got to have his top security [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3988.36s)]
*  clearance in order to represent them. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3990.36s)]
*  And his whole game now [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3992.36s)]
*  is attacking Trump. He's a complete [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3994.36s)]
*  Trump derangement syndrome [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3996.36s)]
*  sufferer. He hates Republicans. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=3998.36s)]
*  Why should we allow him [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4000.36s)]
*  access to the nation's secrets? I don't know [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4002.36s)]
*  what's going to happen to his business now, but [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4004.36s)]
*  good luck, Mark. Anyway, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4006.36s)]
*  Trump's been on a roll. He's doing a lot [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4008.36s)]
*  more. And we need it. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4010.36s)]
*  We need it all. What he did with the Kennedy [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4012.36s)]
*  Senator board, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4014.36s)]
*  he got rid of all the Kennedy Center [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4016.36s)]
*  or most of the board and [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4018.36s)]
*  made himself chair. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4020.36s)]
*  All they do is honor left-wingers. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4022.36s)]
*  That's all this thing does. [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4024.36s)]
*  So why, he's right. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4026.36s)]
*  Why don't we clean house? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4028.36s)]
*  I think he made Rick Grinnell [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4030.36s)]
*  the acting director. Or he gave him an honor. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4032.36s)]
*  I can't remember, but Rick Grinnell is now going to be on [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4034.36s)]
*  that board. I love [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4036.36s)]
*  it. It's like all [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4038.36s)]
*  your right-wing dreams come true [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4040.36s)]
*  every day. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4042.36s)]
*  He's still at it. Okay, so we'll get back into that [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4044.36s)]
*  tomorrow and do more substance. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4046.36s)]
*  Thank you for bearing with me. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4048.36s)]
*  I do want to tell you just a couple of other fun things [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RcGiJm0aBvc&t=4050.36s)]
