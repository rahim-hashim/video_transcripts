# Joy Reid Finally Fired, Bongino Joins Trump Admin, and Possible Peace Deal, with Victor Davis Hanson
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Monday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, we might get a peace deal in Ukraine this week. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3.7600000000000002s)]
*  And the media is freaking out about Elon Musk emailing every government employee this weekend. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=7.6000000000000005s)]
*  But the big news tonight will be Joy Reid's final show on MSNBC. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=12.8s)]
*  Single-tier white woman tears happening right here, Joy. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=20.0s)]
*  She was officially fired over the weekend because she's a racist, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=24.4s)]
*  horrible news anchor with no ratings. And that's really been the truth for a long time. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=28.96s)]
*  MSNBC is under new management and I guess they decided to come to grips with reality. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=35.36s)]
*  The truth is this is very sad news for us as she's provided so much material over the years. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  I feel the way I felt when Brian Stelter got fired. But he came back and you never know. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=47.519999999999996s)]
*  I'm sure Joy Reid will wind up doing something where we will continue [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=52.56s)]
*  to get to respond to her absolutely insane POV. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=56.800000000000004s)]
*  We're going to get into what it means with our guest today for the full show, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=61.760000000000005s)]
*  Victor Davis Hansen. He's a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  and author of the book, The Case for Trump. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=69.76s)]
*  Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook, and X. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=74.4s)]
*  We continue to face uncertainty when it comes to the economy with a perfect storm brewing [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=80.8s)]
*  as Social Security and Medicare hit a breaking point as the largest generation is hitting [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=84.96s)]
*  retirement. A smaller workforce means a smaller tax base. You pair that with our growing national [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=89.92s)]
*  debt and rising cost of living and we could have a big problem. So what are you doing now to protect [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=95.12s)]
*  your family for the future? Well, gold can be a safe haven in hard economic times and birch gold [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=100.32s)]

*  VDH welcome back. Thank you for having me Megan. Oh I like the Matt Drudge hat look today. Very [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=142.72s)]
*  small. I don't know if it's Matt Drudge. I don't think it's Matt Drudge. Well obviously Matt Drudge, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=149.92s)]
*  we no longer recognize Matt Drudge the actual. No I don't. I don't know. I don't know what [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=156.24s)]
*  happened to him. Something happened. Neither do I. Somebody said and this is totally unconfirmed, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=160.56s)]
*  but somebody told me when I was in some political muckety muck circles over the Super Bowl weekend [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=164.32s)]
*  that they heard he got bought out by somebody with like hundreds of millions and that person [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=172.0s)]
*  is a leftist and kind of purchased his opinion. That doesn't sound like Drudge to me but what the [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=177.92000000000002s)]
*  hell do I know? Okay forget about him. Let's talk about Joy Reid. I'm so torn. Oh Victor I'm so torn. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=183.92s)]
*  You know I'm thrilled she's gone. She literally was the most racist person on television. Her and her [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=192.07999999999998s)]
*  most favorite guest Eli Mistel or Ellie Mistel. So they deserve 100% both to be fired but you know [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=197.44s)]
*  it's like we won't have her to kick around anymore and there's a little sadness in that. This is one [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=205.76s)]
*  of the many reasons why most of us are absolutely delighted to see her get fired from this show [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=210.4s)]
*  and it appears from MSNBC. Tonight we believe we'll be here last night. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=218.08s)]
*  A little walk down memory lane in Sat One. In America there's a thing about both white vigilantism [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=223.84s)]
*  and white tears, particularly male white tears. Really white tears in general because that's what [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=232.08s)]
*  carrots are right? They care now and then as soon as they get caught they bring waterworks. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=239.68s)]
*  Rhonda Santis has been waging a full scale war against the black past. It's illegal to make [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=244.88s)]
*  white people feel uncomfortable in Florida. You also have the restrictions in schools over what [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=251.68s)]
*  can be taught about race and gender for fear white children might feel bad when they find out that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=256.24s)]
*  not all white people in history were heroes. Do any of you guys trust Uncle Clarence? These Republicans [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=260.96000000000004s)]
*  are dangerous. They're dangerous to our national security because stoking that kind of soft white [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=266.08s)]
*  nationalism eventually leads to the hard from the Tea Party on. They're voting on race the idea that [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=271.84s)]
*  they can't get whatever job they want. A black person got it therefore drive all the blacks out [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=278.64s)]
*  of the colleges. They're just voting specifically on racial animus at this stage. It isn't about [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=282.88s)]
*  economics. They want to turn every state into their white Christian nationalist hell. It's Def Con One [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=288.32s)]
*  take action and stay woke. So will Mr. A little I guess Victor what do you make of the fact that [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=296.15999999999997s)]
*  even MSNBC finally had enough? Yeah I mean if you had just substituted the word [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=309.2s)]
*  black for white and any other person had said what she did and just said black instead of white they [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=318.47999999999996s)]
*  would have been fired in 24 hours. She knew that too. So she I remember though you remember Megan [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=323.68s)]
*  when she first got on she had this whole paper trail of being a homophobe. You remember that? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=330.72s)]
*  And then she said and then she said I'm going to get the FBI to investigate because I was hacked [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=336.64s)]
*  and then she completely lied on the air. She was never hacked and then she said she may not have [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=342.88s)]
*  been hacked but she couldn't. Then she said she was almost as if she was in a suspended state [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=347.36s)]
*  of animation. I may have written this but I don't remember ever saying this and it was so pathetic. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=351.92s)]
*  She would have been yeah she should have been fired for that and then she had a big rant once [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=358.72s)]
*  I remember where she was mad that so-called white women had cornrows and this was cultural [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=362.88s)]
*  appropriation and she was going to wear authentic black hairstyles and then all of a sudden she [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  started wearing blonde. She dyed her hair blonde and straight. She looked like Trump. Yeah I thought wow you're [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=375.04s)]
*  culturally up this is why do you want to look like an Anglo-Saxon after you gave election that nobody [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=380.8s)]
*  should culturally. Why can't I wear the cornrows or have my daughter get cornrows in the Bahamas on a trip [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=385.6s)]
*  but she can take my hair. She can try to imitate my hair no problem whatsoever. So all I'm saying is that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=390.24s)]
*  she was a sad person. She was had a horrible I'm not trying to psychoanalyze her but she was [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=395.84000000000003s)]
*  terribly insecure and it came out it just exuded from her insecurity insecurity insecurity and she [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=401.52s)]
*  was thrashing around and it was really the problem of the management to put her out there. They should [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=409.68s)]
*  have yanked her from the very beginning and that Ellie Mostel he was an outright racist. I remember [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=414.64s)]
*  he said right after COVID I got used to not seeing white people anymore and it was a good feeling [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=420.24s)]
*  and he just said things that that were I mean they were horribly racist and they they kept [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=427.6s)]
*  they kept spouting that filth and it was horrible and they never nobody ever said anything and then [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=434.4s)]
*  finally the only and her ratings had stayed if I don't think they were ever great but the only reason [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=440.23999999999995s)]
*  they took them off is that people got sick of her after the election but or they would have kept her [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=445.76s)]
*  on they were never bothered by what she said they were just trying to adjudicate whether it was good [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  enough to justify the advertisers I don't know. So they replaced her with two three other hosts two of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=455.76s)]
*  them are black one of whom is Hispanic and I guess they think that will save them we'll see [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=463.36s)]
*  they fired everybody her entire staff has been laid off which apparently they found out [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=468.88s)]
*  about the cancellation from the trade mags or from from from the internet same as the rest of us [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=473.2s)]
*  classic NBC move there's such a classy group over there but it is true that among the dumbest people [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=479.76s)]
*  over at MSNBC she appears to have been the dumbest and the worst rated we just pulled the ratings [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=487.28000000000003s)]
*  from Thursday night on Thursday night this is in the the 25 to 54 demo I mean this is just [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=492.72s)]
*  unbelievable like truly when I was at Fox we were a bad night in the demo would be in the in the [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=497.52000000000004s)]
*  threes 300 and change but it was often 600,000 700,000 and change in the demo those are now the [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=504.8s)]
*  overall numbers the total audience numbers on a great number for most of cable news [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=512.4s)]
*  um here's her demo number from Thursday night 59,000 she was a 4,000 away from Slashies which is [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=518.08s)]
*  well no 9,000 which is 50,000 she was 59,000 that's what she got in the overall demo [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=528.0s)]
*  she lost to her competitor on CNN who had 104,000 lost to Laura Ingraham who had 389,000 [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=534.4s)]
*  uh lost the whole ratings race inside MSNBC where their great white hope Jen Psaki who's taking over [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=542.4s)]
*  now at nine this is all part of a reshuffling she got 65,000 in the key demo 65 that's okay that's [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=550.4s)]
*  their future Rachel Maddow she's their big star for 30 million dollars a year all you have to pull [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=560.24s)]
*  is 144,000 in the demo which I think is what we got I don't even I mean like maybe overnight [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=567.0400000000001s)]
*  at 3 a.m. during a weekend program lineup at Fox 144,000 now earns you 30 million dollars a year [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=575.5200000000001s)]
*  on MSNBC and then the next lowest um well after Reid Ansaki was Stephanie Rule with 88,000 Lawrence [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=583.5200000000001s)]
*  O'Donnell got 103,000 these are all terrible terrible terrible numbers and um that's one of [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=592.24s)]
*  the many reasons Joy Reid is out because she was not only a racist it's very obvious and incredibly [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=597.76s)]
*  alienating but she didn't rate Victor and I think she lasted longer than she otherwise would have [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=603.28s)]
*  given the fact that she constantly played the race card yeah and one of the reasons they lost the [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=608.8s)]
*  election there were many but one of the reasons is that they were so anachronistic they looked at [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=613.36s)]
*  these legacy media NBC ABC CBS PBS NPR LA Times Chicago Tribune Washington Post New York and they [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=618.56s)]

*  revolutionary period and biden was this useful wax and effigy for all of these obama people [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=1682.32s)]
*  and they were going to have this radical agenda and these people at msnbc and to a lesser extent [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=1689.36s)]

*  and so they were doubling down rather than being introspective and saying oh my gosh [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=1737.76s)]
*  i don't think that we're quite in a hard left revolution that everybody's supporting and we [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=1742.24s)]

*  studies show they're making 30 to 40 percent more than people in the private sector and you think [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3290.24s)]
*  the private sector would would make more because they don't have job security and they take greater [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3295.9199999999996s)]

*  in the realm of abuse of the fbi and and i would add to that they had the hunter biden laptop for [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3547.36s)]
*  one year and they knew it was authentic and they knew it was authentic when clapper and brennan and [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3553.84s)]

*  oath to the house to the house intelligence committee and then also memorialized a classified [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3596.64s)]

*  you look at the next one andrew mccabe the intern interim fbi and he lied four times according to [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3608.64s)]
*  michael horowitz the inspector general four times he lied to federal investigators and then we get [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3615.76s)]
*  christopher ray and we see that he would not tell us whether there were any informants that turned [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3621.76s)]

*  corrupt hierarchy and i think he's a wonderful person to go in but he made a really good point [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3639.28s)]
*  when he said this had foreign policy ramifications because the worst thing we've been doing with [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3645.44s)]
*  putin is we have appeased him in some cases but then we've demonized him not that he didn't deserve [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3650.08s)]
*  it but when you tell putin well i'll react if uh it's a major or minor invasion or you say i told [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3655.6s)]
*  vatamir to knock off the cyber attacks on hospitals or maybe i'll fly zelinski out but at the same time [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3664.16s)]
*  you're appeasing him and that was from obama administration you're calling him a murderer or [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3670.8s)]
*  killer and then you're creating this whole idea that the russians through the election to trump [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3675.76s)]
*  it was a complete lie you can see that we could have had a more realistic relationship with russia [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3681.1200000000003s)]
*  and balance them off against china well before these and so he's right there were foreign policy [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3688.6400000000003s)]
*  ramifications you didn't need to lie about vladimir putin he was bad enough but they kept lying [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3698.64s)]
*  and lying and lying and these were the same people during the obama administration that that appeased [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3704.64s)]
*  him with the reset hilly and the red button and the hot mic and soul with barack obama give me [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3709.92s)]
*  space and i'll be flexible all that stuff and yet they they did really damage to a workable relationship [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3716.16s)]
*  with this well i mean this could be accountability day for adam schiff because what's interesting [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3723.44s)]
*  about the bonjino comment is it's about what you're talking about russia gate and so on [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3728.8s)]
*  what adam schiff got the preemptive pardon from biden for was his work on the j6 committee that [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3733.2000000000003s)]
*  was all j6 stuff he did not get a preemptive pardon for everything and so i do wonder what [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3739.2000000000003s)]
*  bonjino exactly will possibly push for once he gets in there like that adam schiff may be exposed [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3745.28s)]
*  on a lot of that stuff let's say hypothetically you decided he should be charged with let's take [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3754.5600000000004s)]
*  one of the democrats favorite charges seditious conspiracy where you you work to overthrow your [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3760.5600000000004s)]
*  government or your president right you could maybe maybe that's what they're going to try i have no [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3767.28s)]
*  idea but um i just looked it up that's got a five-year statute of limitations so we're we're [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3771.92s)]
*  beyond that now i'm yeah we're pretty beyond that right i mean i guess i depend maybe not maybe not [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3776.88s)]
*  because if you look at the full russia gate allegations and how long they took to play out [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3785.12s)]
*  i have to go back and look at the data the muller report anyway you're going to have some some [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3789.52s)]
*  statute of limitations problems but the fbi could certainly make your life unpleasant while they [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3793.6s)]
*  investigate such a thing if there's any sort of colorable claim that we're still in time [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3798.16s)]
*  and if you were a democrat victor you would say let's do that because yeah putting the person [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3803.12s)]
*  through the process and having their name dragged through the mud every day in the papers is the [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3807.3599999999997s)]
*  point actually he's going to look at why the house voted to censor adam smith adam schiff and they [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3811.04s)]
*  did censor him and the reason they did is they said that he lied repeatedly about his involvement [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3819.44s)]
*  with the whistleblower and he repeated the lie serially especially in the house minority report [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3825.52s)]
*  when the new nez memo went out and cash patel was the main architect of that memo and they [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3832.88s)]
*  damned it and said it was a complete it turned out that almost everything in that memo was [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3838.64s)]
*  accurate and then when schiff made a minority memo almost everything in that memo was false [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3843.04s)]
*  and he knew it was false and yet he promulgated that so i don't know if he's legally culpable but [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3850.08s)]
*  he did a lot of damage and maybe bongino can bring light and remind people about that because it did [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3857.44s)]
*  have a bearing on foreign policy and it really it really was bad because donald trump why all this [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3862.56s)]
*  was happening megan he killed the wagner group in syria he got out of an asymmetrical missile deal [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3870.16s)]
*  he was the first person to send offensive weapons to ukraine that biden would later [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3877.28s)]
*  put a hold on and and earlier obama had put a hold on he fled he flooded the markets with cheap oil [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3882.2400000000002s)]
*  he put sanctions on the uh oligarchs and he told the germans don't do this nord stream too it's [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3891.6800000000003s)]
*  terrible you're going to get be a captive of putin so he was the toughest of the last four presidents [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3898.7200000000003s)]
*  on putin but yet this these lies from schiff that he was a asset or a toady and clapper and brennan [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3905.52s)]
*  it really hurt hurt our relationship because on the one hand putin was thinking my god trump [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3912.8s)]
*  is pretty hard on me and yet they're saying that i helped trump and then we got to remember of the [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3919.2s)]
*  last four administration bush obama trump biden there was only one administration where he didn't [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3924.48s)]
*  attack his neighbors he didn't go into georgia or asesia or he didn't try to take the donbas [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3930.56s)]
*  or crimea or he didn't try to take kiev under donald trump and yet donald trump was told we [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3936.8s)]
*  were told that donald trump had appeased him and of course he didn't he was the only one that's [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3942.96s)]
*  deterred him so the whole thing was really a dark chapter in american diplomatic and political [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3948.72s)]
*  history i uh i do want to spend a minute with you on ukraine but before we get to ukraine let's [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3954.8s)]
*  talk about germany so over there in germany the um sort of more moderate conservative party [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3961.04s)]
*  has won their parliamentary elections and the more conservative more to the right more maga-esque [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3969.2000000000003s)]
*  party uh has gotten only 20 of the vote which is very good for them it's just they didn't win [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3976.5600000000004s)]
*  enough to actually win and so unfortunately the moderate republicans over there are conservatives [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3981.76s)]
*  govern with the left in germany they they're not going to form some coalition with the more maga-esque [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3986.88s)]
*  branch of the conservatives they're going to form a coalition with the more leftist [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3992.32s)]
*  branch which is unfortunate for our german friends because that's not what they need [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=3997.28s)]
*  and now already the likely new german chancellor friedrich friedrich mertz who is the leader of [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4001.5200000000004s)]

*  clear that the americans at any case these americans this administration mostly don't [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4025.04s)]
*  care about the fate of europe one way or another also said that intervention from washington a [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4030.8799999999997s)]
*  reference to vance and musk expressing support for afg the alternative for germany party that's the [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4037.12s)]
*  more maga-esque group was no less drastic dramatic and ultimately no less outrageous [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4042.88s)]
*  than the intervention that we've seen from moscow what um people close to this guy describe him as [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4050.7999999999997s)]
*  direct and pragmatic says the washington post but also arrogant and thin-skinned so this does not [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4059.3599999999997s)]
*  sound like a friend to the united states and he's offended by the messaging coming out of the united [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4065.6s)]

*  because if you took the afd's vote and mertz's vote it's about 50 51 percent of the people and [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4087.92s)]

*  federal law trump state law so trump is absolutely right in his constitutional interpretation there [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4401.12s)]
*  and an executive order has the full force and effective law the only way of getting out of an [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qpmEq29XA4Q&t=4407.2s)]
