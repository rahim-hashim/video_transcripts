# Tesla Attacks, Weird Walz Comments, and Judges Keep Fighting Trump, w/ Rich Lowry and Charles Cooke
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk)
*  Okay, there is so much news. I, I, there's so much news. I am thinking about the law [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=0.0s)]
*  fair against Donald Trump, just as much as Chuck Schumer is dreaming about Elon Musk. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=8.34s)]
*  That's what's happening right now. We are in day 58 of Trump's presidency and the resistance [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=13.42s)]
*  is out in full force. This term it's in the courts. We saw them use the courts against [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=18.6s)]
*  Trump to try to prevent him from getting to be the presidential nominee and to be the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=24.42s)]
*  president. And now they are using it to try to ruin his second presidential term. They [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=27.939999999999998s)]
*  used impeachment twice during the first term. Now they're using the courts ad nauseam during [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=32.58s)]
*  the second term to try to block his entire agenda. And they have very compliant, willing [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=38.86s)]
*  district court judges appointed by Obama and Biden helping them, helping them. They are [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=44.099999999999994s)]
*  trying to block Trump's clear constitutional powers when it comes to who serves in the [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=50.099999999999994s)]
*  military in his military, of which he is the commander in chief. You've got some woke [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=54.62s)]
*  LGBTQ female justice judge who thinks she knows better. Who the hell elected you, Judge [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=59.26s)]
*  Reyes as commander in chief of the military and not just the military. You got the border, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=66.22s)]
*  you got hiring and firing inside the executive branch and much, much more. And this is nowhere [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=71.86s)]
*  near over perfect guests for today. It is an NR day here at the MK show, Charles CW cook, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=75.34s)]
*  senior editor and host of the Charles CW cook podcast and Rich Lowry editor in chief of [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=81.34s)]
*  national review. You can find all their work ad free with an NR plus membership. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=86.42s)]
*  And that the American dream starts with purpose by honoring your career calling. You can impact [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=111.34s)]
*  your family, friends, and your community change the world for good by putting others before [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=116.46000000000001s)]
*  yourself, whether your pursuit involves a bachelor's masters or doctoral degree, GCUs [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  online, on campus and hybrid learning environments are designed to help you achieve your unique [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=126.14s)]
*  academic, personal, and professional goals. Plus you can pick them in your March madness [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=130.7s)]
*  Go Antelopes. I feel like they're playing Maryland. I'm trying to remember, but I definitely [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=136.34s)]
*  did choose them. Yeah, Maryland. Um, because my method is I choose the teams that I have [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=141.86s)]
*  some connection to, um, unless I have no connection to either, in which case I go with the odds, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=147.26s)]
*  but I have a connection to GCU thanks to that wonderful university being an advertiser on [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=151.46s)]
*  our show. And I hope you give them the same benefit of the doubt and making your choices [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=156.74s)]
*  With over 340 academic programs as of September of last year, GCU meets you where you are [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=161.24s)]
*  and provides a path to help you fulfill your dreams. The pursuit to serve others is yours. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=167.44000000000003s)]
*  Let it flourish. Find your purpose at Grand Canyon University. Private Christian affordable. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=172.0s)]
*  Visit GCU.edu. Charlie rich. Welcome back. Great to have you. Let's kick it off with [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=177.36s)]
*  judge Anna Reyes. I mean, I'm, I'm at my wits end about some of this lawfare, but this one [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=183.52s)]
*  in particular, let me just tell you something. Okay. You can be kicked out of the military for [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=190.36s)]
*  your height, your weight, and your vision. These things can get you ejected from the American [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=198.76000000000002s)]
*  military. You can get kicked out if you're on the autism spectrum. You can get kicked out if you have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=205.72000000000003s)]
*  certain mood disorders. You can get kicked out if you have, uh, ADD, ADD, if you have depression, [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=211.4s)]
*  there are, if you have history of a single adjustment disorder, depending on the circum history [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=220.44000000000003s)]
*  of an eating disorder, all of that, the military can say, you may not serve, but if you have gender [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=225.4s)]
*  dysphoria and say, you're a trans person, you're a man who thinks he's a woman or vice versa, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=232.52s)]
*  this judge, LGBTQ, she's the first openly gay woman on the bench. Um, in, in at least DC, I think [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=239.64000000000001s)]
*  it is has ruled you, you must be allowed to serve that the commander in chief and the secretary of [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=248.04s)]
*  defense may not tell you that you cannot serve. You can be too short. Your anxiety can be a deal [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=255.64s)]
*  breaker, but you're thinking you're a woman when you're actually a man. Rich is a bridge too far [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=263.08s)]
*  for this woke leftist judge who is, has already declared prior to her ruling last night saying [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=271.71999999999997s)]
*  the Trump executive order on this issue is null and void that the notion that there are only two [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=279.32s)]
*  genders is correct is incorrect. It is biologically incorrect. She says, what, what is, what has it [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  come to the lawfare has come to this? Yeah. So obviously this is an initiative entirely consistent [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=294.44s)]
*  with secretary of defense's entire priority at the Pentagon, which is to focus on war fighting [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=301.16s)]
*  and not get distracted by any other nonsense. And you can make an entirely rational case that [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  gender dysphoria is not consistent with the rigors of combat and what you want an organization [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=312.6s)]
*  devoted to combat to focus on. And in fact, this determination is so rational. It was, it was [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=318.36s)]
*  actually the case. It was a status quo as of what 10 years ago or something. So it's an innovation [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=323.96000000000004s)]
*  where we've accommodated these folks. And this is Megan, this for me falls into the range of these [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=329.32s)]
*  legal decisions. If legal contentions, if it has to do with the president of the United States core [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=335.56s)]
*  executive functions, how many people are working for him? Who's working for him? What's national [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=341.24s)]
*  security and not he's ultimately going to win these cases. Now I think it's, it's highly irritating. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  These, these judges, some of them are totally ridiculous and it's going to delay things, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=353.56s)]
*  but this seems to me one that he will ultimately prevail on. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=358.76s)]
*  So Charles, this woman, again, unlike her, one of her bosses on the U S Supreme court, Katanji [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=363.64s)]
*  Brown Jackson, she does appear to be able to say what a woman is. Um, and she wants, or at least [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=370.6s)]
*  she's got thoughts on gender, on how there's, there's more than two. She'll state that affirmatively. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=378.28s)]
*  There's more than two. And that's a biological fact, according to this judge, it's, it's absolutely [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=382.6s)]
*  absurd. And that she, in her ruling took such issue with the department of justice arguing on [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=387.64000000000004s)]
*  behalf of the department of defense because Trump's executive order on this, which was clearly a [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=395.16s)]
*  Pentagon thing said it's important in the military to be able, to be able to serve with integrity [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=400.68s)]
*  and honesty and in wellness. And she said, that's them accusing all trans people of being liars, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=409.24s)]
*  which I mean, not for nothing, but you could make the case. If you're looking at me and you're [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=417.40000000000003s)]
*  Charles CW cook and saying, you're a woman. Yeah, I'm probably going to think you're not telling me [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=420.92s)]
*  the truth. Um, but in any event, she got in this lawyer's face and said, oh, that shows animus. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=424.76000000000005s)]
*  It's like hatred by president Trump towards trans people. And what, what should I do to you? [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=434.04s)]
*  Should I ban this guy? This lawyer went to the university of Virginia law school. Should I band [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=439.48s)]
*  ban all university of Virginia lawyers from this point forward from, for being liars? [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=443.56s)]
*  This is part of why the DOJ filed a misconduct complaint against this judge [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=449.08000000000004s)]
*  after an earlier hearing she's out of control. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=454.28000000000003s)]
*  Yes, this is one of the worst Trump law cases I've ever seen for a whole host of reasons. First off, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=456.76s)]
*  there's simply no constitutional or statutory basis for this decision and therefore it's void. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=466.52s)]
*  Second, the fake constitution makes an appearance here where the as Rich says, core powers, core [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=473.08s)]
*  competencies, core allocations of authority to the president are subject to these supposed standards [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=482.68s)]
*  of kindness, niceness, which simply don't exist in the law in this area. There are some circumstances [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=490.68s)]
*  where rational basis review, for example, might obtain, but you don't get rational basis review [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  in the military. The president and the secretary of defense can decide who serves and why with [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=505.8s)]
*  effectively plenary power. And the third reason it's grotesque is if you read all the way to the end, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=513.5600000000001s)]
*  as I did last night, you sense a certain underconfidence in the judge because she, [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=519.72s)]
*  she lapses the conclusion into all this more kish nonsense where she starts thanking people for their [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=524.0400000000001s)]
*  service and talks about the military as if she's making a speech on Veterans Day. And then she says, [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=530.84s)]
*  this of course will cause all manner of public debate and disagreement in the country, [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=538.52s)]
*  which is a good outcome. Why? You're a judge. The creation of debate is totally irrelevant to the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=544.12s)]
*  job description. It's not good or bad either way. Your job is to follow the law. So this really [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=553.0s)]
*  struck me when reading it as the work of a politician rather than of a judge. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=560.12s)]
*  Same. Thank you for saying it so clearly. Could not agree more. She, she goes to me, this is like, [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=566.84s)]
*  she's looking for a pat on the head from GLAAD or the human rights campaign. She, she's waiting for [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=573.16s)]
*  Sotomayor or Katanji Brown Jackson or Kagan to say, good girl, you're a good little girl. You, [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=580.12s)]
*  you wrote all the right things. Kagan, not for nothing is, she's gay, isn't she? [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=584.92s)]
*  I don't know why that just got away from you. I'm pretty sure Kagan's gay. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=590.5999999999999s)]
*  She plays softball. That's, that's all we know. She is a softball star at some point. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=595.24s)]
*  Circumstantial, but we could admit it into evidence. Okay. But this is what she writes in part, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=600.68s)]
*  um, at times leaders have used this concern to ensure military readiness, [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=607.88s)]
*  to deny marginalized persons, the privilege of serving fill in the blank, which is, she writes [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=615.0s)]
*  those words is not fully capable and will hinder combat effectiveness. Fill in the bank, the blank [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=621.0s)]
*  will disrupt unit cohesion and so diminish military effectiveness, allowing fill in the [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=627.24s)]
*  blank to serve will undermine training, make it impossible to recruit successfully and disrupt [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=633.08s)]
*  military order. First minorities, then women in combat, then gays filled in that blank today. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=638.04s)]
*  However, our military is stronger and our nation is safer for the millions of such blanks and all [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=646.12s)]
*  other persons who serve. Now, first of all, that is not her judgment to make. She is not commander [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=653.32s)]
*  of the armed forces and there actually are hot debates going on in this country right now [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=660.84s)]
*  about not minorities, but adding women to positions. For example, in combat has made us [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=665.1600000000001s)]
*  the strongest we've ever been when it comes to our military readiness. That's something that's [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=671.5600000000001s)]
*  she, this is not for her to opine on rich and for her to try to treat transgender individuals, [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=676.12s)]
*  the same as blacks or Latinos is outrageous. One is skin color and race and one has to do with a [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=685.4s)]
*  mental disorder that's in the DSM five. Yeah. So one opine is the right word. What you read would be [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=695.48s)]
*  pretty good. At least kind of bog level, one third of a New York Times column, right? But that's not [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=703.56s)]
*  her role as a judge. And we had a lot of loose talk, right? Of a constitutional crisis. I think [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=709.0s)]
*  we talked about that last time we were on is the constitutional crisis. If judges are overstepping [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=713.88s)]
*  their bounds and impinging on the executive authority and the people who scream loudest about [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=720.36s)]
*  a constitutional crisis, they never focus on that, right? Everyone has their appointed role in the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=726.2s)]
*  constitutional system. And if anyone oversteps it, that is profoundly wrong. So this decision [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=730.28s)]
*  is profoundly wrong. And the point you make about being your race being different from your so-called [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=735.88s)]
*  gender identity is a good one. And this is one reason, and maybe we're going to talk about this [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=741.72s)]
*  later, that the left is so wrong-footed on the trans issue. They thought it was a civil rights [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=747.32s)]
*  issue, right? They thought it was like civil rights for African-Americans or civil rights for [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=752.52s)]
*  gay people. And they've gone into something that most people do not consider that way, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=757.24s)]
*  because it is a totally different category. And this opinion is a prime example of that. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=762.76s)]
*  Mm-hmm. She goes on to say as follows. Stand by. Okay. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=769.4s)]
*  It is self-evident truth, she posits, that all people are created equal. All means all, nothing [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=778.6800000000001s)]
*  more and certainly nothing less. So Charlie, she's suggesting that trans people are being treated in [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=787.4s)]
*  a way that renders them unequal and that this is not allowed in our military, which is not true. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=793.48s)]
*  Right. So I believe that all men are created equal. You can't see it, but just over [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=803.8000000000001s)]
*  top my desk is a copy of the Declaration of Independence in a frame. And that maxim, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=808.9200000000001s)]
*  which really is the foundation of everything I write about, has absolutely nothing to do [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=815.96s)]
*  with this question. It is also true that people who grow no taller than four foot five are equal. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=821.24s)]
*  They're not inferior. They shouldn't be treated differently under the law. They also can't or [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=828.28s)]
*  shouldn't be able to join the military in the same way as a six foot five Navy SEAL should. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=833.48s)]
*  What we're talking about here is not the usual questions of how citizens are treated by the [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=840.28s)]
*  government when the government interferes with the liberty or property or lives of the citizenry. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=846.92s)]
*  That's when all of the maxims in the declaration and the premises of the constitution, the Bill [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=853.64s)]
*  of Rights, equal protection and so forth, apply. We're talking about what should be a lethal fighting [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=859.9599999999999s)]
*  force. We have always very harshly discriminated within the military for the sole reason that the [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=865.3199999999999s)]
*  military exists to fight and kill and die. This is absurd. And I can't think of a better illustration [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=873.24s)]
*  of what Pete Hegseth said during his hearing that the military has left its historical presumptions [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=880.92s)]
*  and come to see itself as some sort of social club or social experimentation society than this. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=891.96s)]
*  You will not find, Megan, someone who is more willing to wave the Bill of Rights around or demand [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=899.0799999999999s)]
*  equal protection or call for the original understanding of the constitution than me. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=905.3199999999999s)]
*  But the original understanding of the constitution simply does not involve judges enforcing what they [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=910.68s)]
*  think is equality within the commander-in-chief's purview. And that is ultimately all that matters [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=917.4s)]
*  to a judge. [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=924.28s)]
*  That's right. She goes on to say, okay, she's rejecting the Pentagon's position because one of [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=927.24s)]
*  the justifications they gave her when they got sued over this was the costs associated with [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=935.3199999999999s)]
*  so-called gender-affirming health care, which is a complete misnomer. Gender-affirming health care [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=943.64s)]
*  would say, here, I'm a shrink. If you were born a boy, you remain a boy. That's what it should be. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=949.08s)]
*  But it's, of course, one of those terms that's been manipulated by these leftist activists. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=955.48s)]
*  In any event, she's saying that the military has said, look, providing this so-called health [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=960.6s)]
*  care to trans people for their gender procedures, because right now we're paying for their surgeries. [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=966.44s)]
*  Well, maybe not right this second because Trump signed the EO, but actually it's not effective [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=971.8000000000001s)]
*  until the end of March, so we are. We're paying for their surgeries. We're paying for their [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=975.8s)]
*  hormones, their cross-gender procedures, all of it. And the military went in there and said, look, [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  we're paying $5.2 million a year for this stuff. And she responds by saying, well, that's only [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=986.3599999999999s)]
*  5,700 thousandth of a percent of total military spending for 2024. So once again, Judge Reyes [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=995.9599999999999s)]
*  thinks we've elected her to be the chief accountant over at the Pentagon to decide what's [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1004.52s)]
*  worth it and what's not. And then she has the nerve to point out the department spent approximately [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1010.1999999999999s)]
*  41 million for Viagra in 2023. 41 million for Viagra, about 5.2 million for gender affirming [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1014.92s)]
*  care. Defendants do not explain why the former and every other medical cost is acceptable, [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1023.0s)]
*  while the latter requires banning trans people from military service. This is unbelievable, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1028.76s)]
*  Rich, because you've got men, active duty men who rely for their healthcare on the VA, on the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1033.16s)]
*  Pentagon if they're active duty, who, yeah, some of them need Viagra. And this woman wants to shame [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1039.88s)]
*  them and the military for providing it. Well, if they won't also pay for us to, in other cases, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1045.48s)]
*  chop off penises and try to create fake vaginas and then send them out and tell them to go kill [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1052.6000000000001s)]
*  ISIS. I can't. Yeah, no, it's core executive function, core executive decision, what you're [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1059.24s)]
*  going to spend money on and what you're not. It's a little bit like saying, you know, if the military [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1065.32s)]
*  says we don't want to recruit obese people for combat roles and the judge saying, well, you can [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1070.28s)]
*  pay for the Ozempic, right? It's not that much. You know, you're paying much more for your missile [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1074.76s)]
*  programs and your tanks. So why won't you pay for this? It's not her decision. And as Charlie [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1079.24s)]
*  rightly points out, this is, it's not, not everyone gets to serve in the military, right? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1084.52s)]
*  If I want to go on combat right now, which I don't, my hats off to everyone who does, they'd say, [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1089.56s)]
*  no, you're too old, you're out of shape and you've never made a bed, you know, in your life. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1094.2s)]
*  You're not suitable for the military life. And they'd be right. And by the way, another reason [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1098.36s)]
*  to take the initiative here that the Pentagon is, is very important to Pete Hexeth to send the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1103.32s)]
*  message we're no longer doing social services. We're no longer doing progressive social studies. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1111.24s)]
*  We're focusing on fighting because that is a way to attract the people you want to the military. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1119.32s)]
*  These guys and gals who are attracted to the military life, they're different than we are. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1126.44s)]
*  They want the adventure. They want the risk. If they wanted to sit and get a lecture about how [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1131.56s)]
*  they're racist, sexist, transphobic and all of that, they go to their local community college. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1137.08s)]
*  That's not what they want to do. So you want to create the, send the image and send the message, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1143.72s)]
*  which he has in various ways, right? He's done deadlifts in Germany with the guys, this, a whole [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1148.84s)]
*  host of other things to send. You know what to say for the people who are attracted to this, [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1154.6799999999998s)]
*  we are a military organization. People are in shape that matters to us. That's another thing [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1159.0s)]
*  he's doing is having a review of the physical fitness of members of the military. Come here [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1163.64s)]
*  if you want the adventure to defend your country. So I see this as part of that. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1168.5200000000002s)]
*  Yeah. She, she's very angry in this opinion about the alleged animus. Again, it's another word for [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1173.72s)]
*  hatred of president Trump in the executive order. She writes the military ban is soaked in animus [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1180.1200000000001s)]
*  and dripping with pretext. Its language is unabashedly demeaning. Its policy stigmatizes [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1187.32s)]
*  transgender persons as inherently unfit and its conclusions bear no relation to fact. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1194.6799999999998s)]
*  Thus, even if the court analyzed the military ban under the rational basis review, which is the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1201.6399999999999s)]
*  easiest one to pass, it would fail. Uh, defendants have not provided a legitimate reason for banning [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1205.96s)]
*  all transgender troops. The military ban is unique in its unadulterated expression of animus. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1211.96s)]
*  Now I'm, I looked at the ban and I didn't see any of that. I'm not going to read the whole thing [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1218.8400000000001s)]
*  cause it's long, but it talks about here's, they say during the Biden administration, the department [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1224.28s)]
*  of defense allowed gender insanity to pervade our military organizations. That's not animus, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1229.4s)]
*  gender insanity pervading the military organizations means a lot of things. Um, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1233.72s)]
*  and there's nothing hateful about it. This included not only permitting the military [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1238.4399999999998s)]
*  to increase the number of individuals, not physically or mentally prepared to serve, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1241.8799999999999s)]
*  but also ordering DOD to pay for service members, transition surgeries, as that, as well as those of [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1244.6s)]
*  their dependent children at a cost of millions to the American taxpayer, the U S imposes rigorous [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1250.12s)]
*  standards on all military service members to ensure they're prepared to take on the challenges [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1255.0s)]
*  fitness, health, welfare, and readiness standards, much ensure they're ready to fight [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1258.28s)]
*  on the battlefield. There can be no accommodation for anything less than resilience strength and [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1261.8799999999999s)]
*  the ability to withstand extraordinary physical demands. Individuals who are unable to meet these [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1265.0s)]
*  requirements are unable to serve. This has been the case for decades. I basically am reading the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1269.0s)]
*  whole thing by the way, you know, cohesion requires high levels of integrity and stability [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1273.0s)]
*  among service members, high levels of integrity and stability. I'm like, honestly, [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1278.76s)]
*  is this where she's getting animus from saying that it can take a minimum of 12 months for an [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1283.0s)]
*  individual to compete complete treatments after transition surgery, which often involves the use [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1287.64s)]
*  of heavy narcotics. That's true. As I've mentioned before, there's someone in my extended family who [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1292.36s)]
*  went through this. It's a crazy story. One day, maybe I'll get permission to tell it, but trust me, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1299.6399999999999s)]
*  yes, that's true. During this period, they are not physically capable of meeting military readiness [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1305.4799999999998s)]
*  requirements and require ongoing medical care. This is not conducive for deployment or other [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1311.8799999999999s)]
*  readiness requirements. Anyway, this is not full of animus. She is the one who is full of animus. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1315.8799999999999s)]

*  to what the current sitting defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, says are the readiness requirements [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1328.84s)]
*  of the military. I choose instead to look at Joe Biden's chairman of the joint chiefs, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1335.72s)]
*  who she says has a stellar military record. And she said, unlike this current guy, who's only been [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1343.08s)]
*  there for 30 days and had only a quote limited deployment for a short period prior to his TV [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1349.88s)]

*  Yeah, so I agree with everything you just said about Pete Hegseth, and I was strongly in favor [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1383.56s)]
*  of his nomination. But let's just a thought experiment assume that instead of choosing [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1387.96s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, Donald Trump had chosen someone that all three of us thought was an absolute moron. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1392.44s)]
*  It wouldn't matter, because Donald Trump would have won the presidential election. He would have [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1398.3600000000001s)]
*  taken hold of, after his inauguration, the commander in chief powers, and providing the [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1404.04s)]
*  Senate had agreed, his choice for secretary of defense would have been installed in the [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1408.76s)]
*  Department of Defense. When this case was argued, that person, this hypothetical moron, [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1417.16s)]
*  would have been able to make these decisions. One of the criticisms that we on the right very often [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1423.8s)]
*  make of progressives is that they don't really want a democratic system. What they want is rule [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1430.36s)]
*  by experts. And what this judge is trying to do here is prove us right. Because her argument was, [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1435.24s)]
*  I don't like the expertise or credentials or opinions of person A, the person who is actually [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1441.0s)]
*  in charge. So I will instead try to sustain the opinions of person B, who is no longer [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1447.8799999999999s)]
*  secretary of defense and who was serving at the pleasure of a president who was out of office and [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1455.56s)]
*  whose would-be successor lost. There is no rational basis review in this area. I know that she lays [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1461.8799999999999s)]
*  out what would satisfy it, but there is no rational basis review. There is no mechanism by which she [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1470.52s)]
*  gets to decide whether or not she respects the person who won the election or the person who [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1477.08s)]
*  the Senate agreed to put in the Department of Defense. None of that happens. And with animus, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1482.28s)]
*  I agree with you, it's not really dripping with animus. But again, thought experiment, let's assume [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1490.04s)]
*  that it were dripping with animus. In most cases in the law, there are a few exceptions, but in most [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1494.12s)]
*  cases in the law, having the court try to decide the emotional state or mental motivations of people [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1500.36s)]
*  who are promulgating rules, especially within the military, is just inappropriate. That's not how [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1508.84s)]
*  law is supposed to work. We write down our laws and we decide whether or not they have been satisfied. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1515.32s)]
*  So even if she personally detects animus in that or thinks that it was hateful, with a few exceptions [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1521.1599999999999s)]
*  that absolutely do not obtain here, it doesn't matter. She doesn't get to make that call. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1527.9599999999998s)]
*  Couldn't agree more. All right, let's move on because there are other cases to get to, [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1534.76s)]
*  and there's a lot of lawfare being unleashed against Trump. It is obviously the ACLU's slash [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1538.36s)]
*  lefts, but I repeat myself, favored tool in stopping the Trump agenda. You had quickly a decision from [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1543.32s)]
*  a judge, this guy too was an Obama judge, last night saying some of the cuts made by Doge and [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1551.8s)]
*  Elon Musk at USAID must be reversed. You have to restore access to emails and computers for these [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1560.9199999999998s)]
*  employees. Basically anything that came from Musk or Doge has been undone saying he's a non-confirmed [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1567.88s)]
*  government appointee, executive branch appointee, and therefore his decisions had to be struck down [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1575.0s)]
*  because the judge finding he needed to be Senate confirmed to be doing this. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1580.92s)]
*  Look, I don't want to spend time on that one because the effect of that is Marco Rubio just [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1584.92s)]
*  needs to make all the same decisions and he'll be fine. All the same things are about to happen. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1589.5600000000002s)]
*  It's just Marco Rubio who is Senate confirmed 99 to zero, by the way, will now make those same [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1593.6399999999999s)]
*  decisions. They're basically saying Elon was ahead of his skis on exercising certain powers. He needs [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1598.28s)]
*  to be more of a reviewer and a recommender as opposed to an executioner of his specific findings [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1603.56s)]
*  and recommendations. Okay, so that's that. Then we have to move on to what's happening with the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1609.8799999999999s)]
*  Tren de Aragua members accused who Trump deported to El Salvador, which is a pretty effective [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1614.68s)]
*  deterrent. Warning to Tren de Aragua members, now may not be the best time to try to sneak across [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1624.92s)]
*  the border and enter the United States because there's a new sheriff in town and his name is [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1632.6000000000001s)]
*  Tom Homan and he will track you down and he will put you on a plane and before you know it, you [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1636.92s)]
*  will be in this prison in El Salvador. Good luck to you. I have zero sympathy for any of them, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1641.08s)]
*  but a big legal dispute has unfolded over whether Trump has the right to do this. Now, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1650.04s)]
*  first let's spend a moment on the judge. His name is Brosberg. He is in the D, these are all DC [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1657.08s)]
*  district court judges, federal district court judges in Washington DC because that's where [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1663.56s)]
*  the government's based. He was an Obama appointee and there's a very interesting [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1667.0s)]
*  question being raised online about whether he should have recused himself from this case [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1672.44s)]
*  to begin with. I'll tell you, I've got my own questions about it. Laura Loomer, she's said [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1678.36s)]
*  some things that are not true and that are conspiratorial, but she said a lot that is true. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1686.52s)]
*  She is not wrong just because she's controversial. We'll find out, we'll update the audience, but [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1690.28s)]
*  she went and we believe what she did is she looked at his confirmation hearing to see what he said [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1696.6000000000001s)]
*  about himself and it looks to us like at his confirmation hearing, he did confirm that he has [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1702.28s)]
*  he had two daughters, twins, one of whom is named Katherine. It looks like Katherine's age right now [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1707.72s)]
*  would be 24 or 25 and that dovetails with the picture that we have of the alleged Katherine [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1718.44s)]
*  Roseberg who is being accused in this exclusive thread by Laura Loomer of working for a 501c3 [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1726.04s)]
*  called Partners for Justice, which gives criminal illegal aliens and gang members legal advice. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1732.76s)]
*  Partners for Justice strongly opposes mass deportations and legislation start targeting [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1739.4s)]
*  members of criminal gangs and has been a vocal critic for the Laken of the Laken Reilly Act, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1744.12s)]
*  Loomer reports. You can see in a screenshot she posts that Katherine Boesberg and we think it's [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1749.8s)]
*  the same Katherine Boesberg, but that does need to be confirmed, but Boesberg is an unusual name [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1756.52s)]
*  and it's spelled in both cases, B-O-A-S-B-E-R-G tweeted out an article celebrating Judge Boesberg's [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1760.52s)]
*  blocking Trump's deportations of Venezuelan gang bangers and this would be Katherine Boesberg's [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1767.32s)]
*  boss. She tweeted out her name is Emily Galvin Almanza. That was rightly quick. Trump administration [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1773.32s)]
*  live updates, judge orders halt on deportations of Venezuelans under wartime law. The problem [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1779.7199999999998s)]
*  here potentially is that this judge's daughter could potentially be hurt in her employment [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1787.08s)]
*  by a substantial reduction in crime rates, in case loads involving that keep Partners [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1795.1599999999999s)]
*  for Justice busy relating to gangs and deportations. And so there is a possibility that this judge [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1802.36s)]
*  inappropriately sat on this case or at least violated an ethical canon by not disclosing [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1809.6399999999999s)]
*  that his daughter has an active role in protecting gang members and illegals from deportation. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1815.4799999999998s)]
*  Let's just start there, Rich, with all those qualifiers, your take on it. Well, let's put a [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1822.84s)]
*  pin on that and see what the facts are. He is an Obama appointee. His view of the law, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1828.84s)]
*  constitution not mine, but he has a pretty good reputation. Now this case, it involves a couple [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1835.56s)]
*  things we've seen before. One, the Trump folks kind of rummaging through current statutes to find [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1842.12s)]
*  things that give them the authority they want to do on deportations or on the border. This is quite [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1848.6s)]
*  effective in the first term. There was a migrant crisis, small scale compared to what we saw under [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1852.36s)]
*  Biden in Trump's first term. Trump was tearing his hair out. How could we possibly stop this? [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1857.08s)]
*  He had Stephen Miller and others going and looking at current authorities and using them in a creative [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1862.6s)]
*  and lawful way to create the system that Biden then ripped up. But that had succeeded in basically [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1867.96s)]
*  stopping border crossings. Now here they're going back to the 18th century and there's nothing wrong [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1874.76s)]
*  with that necessarily, right? 18th century has a lot of good things, including the United States [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1880.52s)]
*  Constitution. But it also involves what we're talking about in the first segment, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1884.36s)]
*  determination by the president of the United States, what national security is, what's an invasion, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1889.4799999999998s)]
*  whether we're at war. And here I do think they're pushing the envelope. Maybe they're banking on, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1894.28s)]
*  maybe they'll be right. The Supreme Court ultimately will just say, look, you're the chief [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1901.6399999999999s)]
*  executive, you're the president. You say it's an act of war, these gangs coming into the United [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1904.6s)]
*  States, we're not going to contradict you, but I'm not sure that's going to be the case. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1908.6s)]
*  And what the judge is asking here basically is just to freeze things in place. It wasn't like [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1914.84s)]
*  Judge Ali in one of those early USAID cases saying, you got to spend all this money, [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1920.28s)]
*  billions of dollars of money in 36 hours or whatever it was. It's just, let's hold these [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1925.6399999999999s)]
*  people so at least I can hear the merits here. So on this one, I wouldn't have gone to war with him, [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1930.12s)]
*  but they have. I think Charlie that you and I may disagree on the propriety of Judge [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1937.0s)]
*  Boesberg holding the hearings on this and thinking that he can second guess the Trump [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1944.52s)]
*  administration on this. And that's fine. We can get into that. But my own position is, [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1949.48s)]
*  if you look at the wording, first of all, let's understand this. Trump has already changed [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1953.96s)]
*  expedited removal. They've already expanded the scope of expedited removal. So let's forget for [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1959.72s)]
*  table for a moment, the alien enemies act. Expedited removal has been used by all [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1964.76s)]
*  administrations in certain cases to just return people at the border. Get out. You crossed over. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1970.68s)]
*  Congratulations. You swam the Rio Grande. Goodbye. I don't care. Get out. We can see that you're in [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1976.68s)]
*  illegal and you sneaked in here. Goodbye. Well, he has expanded the use of expedited removal. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1983.4s)]
*  It used to be within a hundred miles of the border and 14 days of their arrival to anywhere in the [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1988.52s)]
*  country against any person who's quote undocumented, who can't prove they've been here [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1992.92s)]
*  for continuously two years. All right. So Trump's already done that saying that's how Tom Homan's [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=1998.6000000000001s)]
*  going into these communities and saying, you're done. You're out. I don't have to give you a [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2005.0s)]
*  hearing. You're just leaving. Now, some have had hearings and just decided to stay because even [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2010.1200000000001s)]
*  when under the Biden administration, they had hearing saying, you have to leave. You don't [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2014.3600000000001s)]
*  qualify for asylum. We never enforced it. We just turned them back out into America and let them [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2017.48s)]
*  live here. So those people are also being ejected. And those might be some of the people who are on [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2022.2s)]
*  one of those planes Trump sent to El Salvador, at least that's what the administration's claiming [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2027.32s)]
*  that they're not all ejected under alien enemies act. Some were ejected under good old fashioned [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2031.0800000000002s)]
*  immigration laws. They'd already been told to leave and they overstayed. Okay. So in any event, [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2035.48s)]
*  if expedited removal can allow Tom Homan to go grab somebody in Colorado and kick them out, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2040.1200000000001s)]
*  why, why is there any controversy over this at all? Why are we even arguing alien enemies act? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2046.76s)]
*  That's my number one thought. My second thought is, okay, but we are, the administration has said [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2054.52s)]
*  alien alien enemies act 1798. It's a law that was written by the very founders who drafted the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2060.7599999999998s)]
*  constitution applies. And that law says, if there's been a declared war, or if the country is suffering [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2066.2799999999997s)]
*  from an invasion or an incursion by a potential enemy's force, the president has the authority [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2075.24s)]
*  to deport the people associated with it without due process. It's really what it says with it. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2082.7599999999998s)]
*  There's no hearing required. You can just throw them out. And Trump is relying not really on the [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2089.08s)]
*  war. He's relying on invasion or incursion. And if you look at the statute, which I did pull [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2094.52s)]
*  in invasion or incursion, how do we determine? Like obviously act of war declared that's by [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2101.56s)]
*  Congress. You have to look to see if Congress had declared war invasion or incursion says as declared [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2107.48s)]
*  by the president. So the enabling statute here passed by Congress at the time of the founding [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2113.1600000000003s)]
*  fathers says the president gets to decide whether it's an invasion or an incursion. And once he's [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2119.4s)]
*  declared that which he has here, he may deport people without due process, which is why I believe [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2126.44s)]
*  he did. He was well within his rights to do what he did. And I think the rest of that enabling [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2133.96s)]
*  statute, alien enemies act kicks in, which says there is no power of judicial review [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2139.0800000000004s)]
*  under these circumstances. Now you go. Well, a few things we're talking about the alien [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2145.32s)]
*  enemies act because Donald Trump has invoked it. In other words, he has conceded by doing that, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2150.44s)]
*  that he needs a power to be conferred upon him by Congress. And that's the one he's chosen. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2155.56s)]
*  The law in question, as you say, has two sections. One of them refers to a declared war. Now you said [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2161.88s)]
*  that the invasion had to be declared by the president. Is that the word declared or is it [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2168.52s)]
*  announced? Either way, I'll look it up. The argument that was made by the president must [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2174.7599999999998s)]
*  make public proclamation of the exactly. And that matters, Megan, because there is a difference [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2183.7999999999997s)]
*  between declaring a war, which is a congressional function and proclaiming something which can be an [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2191.08s)]
*  action done by someone else. Now, I don't know the answer to this. I'm not pretending that I am the [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2197.48s)]
*  Oracle, but I do know this. The act in question has been invoked only three times and they were all [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2202.8399999999997s)]
*  during wars that were declared by Congress. In 1948, this law went to the Supreme Court [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2210.12s)]
*  because three years after hostilities had ceased with Germany, Harry Truman, who had become [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2217.9599999999996s)]
*  president after Franklin Roosevelt, was still using the alien enemies act to expel Germans. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2225.08s)]
*  Now, the Supreme Court looked at it and they said that the decisions of Harry Truman were [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2231.56s)]
*  non-justiciable. In other words, that the courts could not get involved. But that case did not [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2237.24s)]
*  address the invasion clause that you mentioned. It only dealt with declared war. At the time in 1948, [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2243.08s)]
*  Congress still had a declaration of war active against Germany that was not repealed until 1951. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2250.9199999999996s)]
*  And what the court effectively said is this is a political question because there was a war declared, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2257.0s)]
*  because there was a war fought, and because that war created all of these offshoots and consequences, [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2262.44s)]
*  it would be wrong, I think this is correct, for the Supreme Court to determine when the war was [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2267.8s)]
*  over, especially given that Congress had not done that itself. They have never had a decision that [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2272.44s)]
*  related to the invasion clause. Now, it is possible that if they did, they would find that that was [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2279.64s)]
*  also non-justiciable and the determination of an invasion was solely up to the discretion of the [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2285.2400000000002s)]
*  president. But to get there, you're going to have to have a court case. And the core argument that [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2290.36s)]
*  is being made here is that it was inappropriate for this judge to get involved in this, given that [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2297.4s)]
*  the issue is or should be non-justiciable. But I don't think that that is obvious at all. If we're [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2304.2000000000003s)]
*  going to find out that this is non-justiciable, we're going to have to have an argument about it [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2308.84s)]
*  that probably goes all the way up to the Supreme Court, which is what I think we are now seeing [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2313.2400000000002s)]
*  happen. So I'm not upset about this. I would also note, as Jack Goldsmith pointed out, that even in [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2317.64s)]
*  that 1948 case, there were some elements of the law that the court said were within its purview. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2324.04s)]
*  For example, it said that the court was allowed to decide whether or not the people who were being [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2329.8799999999997s)]
*  deported fit the bill. Were they old enough? Were they enemy competence? And so on. Not whether or [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2335.08s)]
*  not there was a war, not whether or not the law could be invoked, but whether the individuals in [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2340.52s)]
*  question were appropriately set. And I think what you're seeing here is the judiciary saying, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2345.16s)]
*  hang on a minute, we're dealing with individuals. The Constitution protects due process for persons, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2355.16s)]
*  not citizens, in all manner of ways. There is no obvious precedent here. We need to litigate this. [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2360.8399999999997s)]
*  And you can't do that when a plane is in the air and it's on its way out to a high-security prison. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2367.3199999999997s)]
*  So I'm less upset about this. Now, do I think that the vast majority of the people to whom this is [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2374.52s)]
*  being applied are likely terrible, terrible people? Yeah. Do I want them deported? Yeah. Would I like [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2379.64s)]
*  to get rid of every illegal immigrant in the country? Yeah. Would I like to get rid of these [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2385.0s)]
*  ones in particular via a trebuchet? You're damn straight, I would. But the argument here, I think, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2388.52s)]
*  is different than the argument that I've made and you've made about the vast majority of these [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2394.84s)]
*  solitary judges who have tried to impede the Trump agenda. Most of those are doing so with [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2399.48s)]
*  no basis in the law whatsoever, basically out of political animus. And this is not the case here. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2404.28s)]
*  So I have more time for this one than you. I have a problem with this judge. I don't agree that he [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2410.92s)]
*  can debate the propriety of the individual. I really don't. I think once you determine that [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2418.12s)]
*  it's a male from Venezuela over 14, it's not for him to determine whether they're a gang member [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2423.16s)]
*  or not. That's up to Holman and Trump. But the court is allowed to do that bit. That's what the [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2428.44s)]
*  Supreme Court cases. The court's allowed to determine if they're 14 or not. Even the DOJ [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2432.6s)]
*  in its filings has acknowledged that, that there is a very bare minimum of inquiry that this judge [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2437.56s)]
*  is allowed to do. But they're arguing that he far exceeded his remit. And the notion that an [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2442.52s)]
*  unelected federal district judge could turn around two planes in the air carrying gang members from [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2450.04s)]
*  Venezuela out of the United States. Again, Stephen Miller raises some very good points [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2457.4s)]
*  without knowing what the fuel supply is, without knowing what the wake time hours of the crew and [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2462.04s)]
*  the pilot are, without understanding whether there was a safe place for them to turn around in [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2467.2400000000002s)]
*  international airspace. The hubris of this man to think he could do it. And by the way, he's making [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2472.44s)]
*  a big deal out of the fact that he issued an oral ruling early Saturday saying, don't let those [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2478.28s)]
*  planes take off. And he didn't write it down until later in the day. And he wants, he thinks [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2483.48s)]
*  they should have complied with the oral ruling. But if you actually look at the civil rules of, [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2488.76s)]
*  the rules of civil procedure, there is a requirement that you write down, especially [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2494.2s)]
*  when it comes to TROs, that you write down what you're mandating. So I think that's why ultimately [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2498.68s)]
*  the judge abandoned what had been done after his oral ruling. But the left-wing media won't tell [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2503.8s)]
*  you that. They ran with, oh, he issued the oral reading, oral ruling early in the day. No. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2509.0s)]
*  But how else do we litigate this? [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2514.2s)]
*  The one that governs is the written ruling. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2515.56s)]
*  But how else do we litigate this? I mean, you've got on behalf of the plaintiffs here, [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2517.4s)]
*  you've got two statutory claims and a constitutional claim. And maybe the Trump [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2521.4s)]
*  administration will prevail and maybe it should. But the people in question, although again, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2525.08s)]
*  I'm sure most of them are terrible, are allegedly in this gang. They have been accused of being in [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2530.6s)]
*  this gang. If you are a judge and this comes to you and you don't have a definitive Supreme Court [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2536.28s)]
*  ruling on this because of the distinction between declared war and an invasion, and you have two [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2541.6400000000003s)]
*  statutory questions being made plus a constitutional question, does the act in and of itself violate [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2546.1200000000003s)]
*  due process when used in this way? I don't know what you do other than involve yourself. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2552.0400000000004s)]
*  But you're saying the distinction between declared war and invasion in a way that would undermine the [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2557.5600000000004s)]
*  Trump administration's argument right now. It only helps. It only helps the Trump administration's [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2562.6s)]
*  argument right now. Declared war would undermine them because they don't have a declared war [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2566.92s)]
*  against Venezuela right now, not by Congress. But incursion or invasion, as I read to you, [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2571.16s)]
*  the statute says the president makes public proclamation of the event. That's all that's [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2576.68s)]
*  required. The president makes public proclamation. He did. He did that. There's no question. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2580.12s)]
*  But it doesn't say, right, but it doesn't, the Supreme Court case that the judge is obliged to [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2584.36s)]
*  follow as a lower court judge does not say what to do in a case where there is no declared war [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2589.8s)]
*  because the 1948 case involved a declared war by Congress. There's never been an instance. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2596.04s)]
*  That's a higher burden. That's a higher burden of proof that was met in that case. This is lower. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2600.76s)]
*  There's no question that there's been a public proclamation, and then it won't take long for [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2606.36s)]
*  a judge to see that that had happened. And then once you get to that, you look at that 1948 decision [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2611.0800000000004s)]
*  you see that they say it is not justiciable. And they go on to say there are all sorts of [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2620.1200000000003s)]
*  reasons how that will end, Charlie, to your point, in very bad results. It will end in the denial of [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2624.84s)]
*  due process and it will end in people who maybe aren't trend to Aragwa getting deported on the [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2630.04s)]
*  plane. But that's too bad. This just isn't an area in which a president can be second guest. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2634.76s)]
*  But that's not what that case says. The case applies to declarations of war. I think your [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2642.76s)]
*  argument is a very strong one that could well prevail in a court. But that portion of the law [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2647.32s)]
*  has never been litigated. The law has never in history been used outside of a declared war. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2653.1600000000003s)]
*  So I hear you, but I just don't see how that undermines my argument. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2659.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, because for example, in the case that went to the Supreme Court, declaration of war was [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2661.96s)]
*  determined by the court to mean by Congress. Presidential proclamation has no court adjudicated [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2668.1200000000003s)]
*  meaning, which means when a plaintiff goes to the court, it's got a plain meaning. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2674.76s)]
*  Does it? Yes. Listen to the statute. Listen to the statute. Quote, whenever there is a declared war [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2679.4s)]
*  between the United States and any foreign nation or government, or, okay, so, or they're separating, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2690.0400000000004s)]
*  or any invasion or predatory incursion is perpetrated, attempted or threatened against [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2696.1200000000003s)]
*  the territory of the United States by any foreign nation or government. And the president makes [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2703.0s)]
*  public proclamation of the event. That's it. It has to have happened and the president has to have [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2707.16s)]
*  made public proclamation of it. They separated it out from declared war. The declared war is a much [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2711.56s)]
*  higher standard proclamation. I agree with that. But we're not. But the point I'm making is that [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2717.08s)]
*  even that standard is subject to a whole bunch of questions. For example, is that a constitutional [[00:45:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2724.2s)]
*  delegation of power? I'm sorry to interrupt you. Let me give you this point because I understand [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2730.84s)]
*  what you're saying. So I just want to advance it and then I'll give it back to you. There is [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2735.96s)]
*  something called, as you know, because you're a constitutional scholar, though not a lawyer, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2740.28s)]
*  but you are a constitutional scholar. I listen to you and read you enough to know you are [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2743.08s)]
*  called a political question doctrine. And we don't allow courts to decide political questions [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2747.32s)]
*  because they don't have the expertise or authority to decide them. That's what this is. That's really [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2752.52s)]
*  why the Alien Enemies Act says when it comes to these certain things, it's just the president's [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2759.08s)]
*  call. And we are not going to have federal district court judges second guessing the commander in chief [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2763.48s)]
*  on these issues. That's why it's not a pro. By what criteria is Judge Broseberg going to decide [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2767.64s)]
*  whether this was an incursion or an invasion? It's not for him to do. But the law does not say that [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2776.04s)]
*  it's non-justiciable. The Supreme Court said that one portion of the law is non-justiciable in part. [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2783.3199999999997s)]
*  My point is that while the argument you're advancing is what it says, because the whole thing is very [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2788.44s)]
*  narrow. It doesn't say only the thing we're talking about. No, they were interpreting the Alien [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2795.0800000000004s)]
*  Enemies Act. They did not say, and we make a distinction as between declared wars and incursions. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2798.28s)]
*  Every time in the 1948 case that the non-justiciability of the law is referred to, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2804.2000000000003s)]
*  it is within the context of a declared war. What I'm saying is that if you are a judge and you have [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2808.84s)]
*  been brought this case and you have presented to you quite a lot of novel questions, including [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2815.64s)]
*  constitutional ones, again, I think your interpretation could well prevail. But there are all manner of [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2823.16s)]
*  laws, especially older laws, that include unconstitutional delegations of power that the [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2829.96s)]
*  courts under current precedent would strike down. So if you are that judge, if we had a war with [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2835.7999999999997s)]
*  Venezuela, your role would have been to say, I'm sorry, this has been settled. This case is not for [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2841.96s)]
*  the judiciary. I can't do anything about it. Go away. But that's not what happened here. And that's [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2846.84s)]
*  why I, and I think Andy McCarthy, or I don't want to speak for him, have some time for the fact that [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2851.88s)]
*  this is now going to work itself up the chain. No, that's fine. I understand that. But it's going [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2856.12s)]
*  to work itself up the chain because there are a whole host of novel questions. Okay. Yeah. It's [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2860.68s)]
*  one of the rare times where I really disagree strongly with Andy. And maybe I'll be proven [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2867.32s)]
*  wrong. You're always on dangerous ground when you're disagreeing with Andy McCarthy, but I do [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2871.48s)]
*  strongly. The thing is, Rich, the political question doctrine is something that the American [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2875.08s)]
*  people understand. You guys just keep going. No, you guys keep going. I was learning so much. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2880.52s)]
*  I was like, and every time you talk, I was like, Megan's right. And then Charlie said, no, Charlie's [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2884.04s)]
*  right. Well, we'll get Andy and Mike Davis on here and then we'll really throw that. But I think the [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2887.32s)]
*  American public understands the political question doctrine, even if they don't know that that's [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2895.72s)]
*  what they're understanding. They understand that the commander in chief has certain inherent powers [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2898.92s)]
*  that the Congress may not and that the judges may not second guess, like being commander in [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2903.08s)]
*  chief and deciding how many resources to devote to a certain war. There are certain things you [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2909.0s)]
*  would, everyone would be outraged if a judge tried to second guess. It's not your chief's turn anymore. [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2913.8s)]
*  I'm bringing Rich into the discussion. He can't help himself. And this is one of the problems in [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2921.08s)]
*  the judge trying to turn around flights that had already left U.S. airspace. Yeah. Well, in terms of [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2928.2s)]
*  the politics, obviously this is good for the Trump administration. All you need to know and all most [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2934.9199999999996s)]
*  people will know is that it happened in time to focus on this is the president of the United States [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2939.3999999999996s)]
*  deported hideous gang members or alleged hideous gang members, most of whom probably are hideous [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2943.7999999999997s)]
*  gang members to El Salvador and a judge tried to stop them. So they're with the Trump administration. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2950.68s)]
*  By the way, the president of El Salvador is incredibly like, give me more of these guys. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2954.84s)]
*  I'm a fan. No one is a foreign leader. I want your gang members, but the president of El Salvador, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2960.04s)]
*  this is what I do. This is my core competency. So I have not followed this as closely as you and [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2963.96s)]
*  Charlie have, but it seems to come down to me. Can the president just, if there's any just the [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2970.52s)]
*  slightest, horrible argument that something's an invasion or a curshion, can he just say it and [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2976.28s)]
*  no one else can countermand him? Right. And in that case, he's going to win. This is beyond that. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2982.04s)]
*  Right. But, but I don't think is, isn't an invasion the way we typically define an invasion? [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2987.24s)]
*  I mean, it's an incursion and look, we've got 10 to 12, we've got 10 to 22 million illegals. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2993.8s)]
*  Listen, Rich, you got, I got to take a break and we can resume this on the other side, but I have [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=2999.24s)]
*  to say you got almost a hundred thousand Americans who died just last year from fentanyl, which is [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3002.84s)]
*  being brought across the border by these folks, which is being made in the United States now by [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3007.48s)]
*  a lot of these folks. These labs are so easy to set up and the fentanyl, the size of a grain of [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3011.0s)]
*  salt can kill many people. So, you know, you have actual American lives being caused to the tune of [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3016.68s)]
*  between 75 and a hundred thousand a year. Number one cause of death for young people in America. [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3024.04s)]
*  Yes. You can absolutely say invasion or incursion. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3028.84s)]
*  Well, look, there are bad things that happen or terrible things or tragic things that aren't the [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3034.2s)]
*  product of an enemy action. Right. Is Venezuela ordering these gang members to come into the [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3039.72s)]
*  United States to wage war against us? They opened their prison and knew they were coming here. [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3044.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, that's different than an invasion. Right. That's not the wheremock coming across the French. [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3050.2799999999997s)]
*  That's as far as Megyn Kelly's willing to go, but the Trump administration is saying that they were [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3056.12s)]
*  sent here and they were asked that explicitly and said, yes, Venezuela didn't do it. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3060.4399999999996s)]
*  If there's a, if there's a culpable case such that, you know, you find it reasonable, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3064.76s)]
*  can a judge just say, forget it. The president, I say it says it. So he's declared it. He's [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3069.48s)]
*  proclaimed it. Yes. And the story that that may be the argument that that prevails, but I'm with [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3073.48s)]
*  Charlie in that it's a political question. Judge Brosberg doesn't get to decide whether Trump [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3077.96s)]
*  has accurately deduced that there is an invasion. He's the commander in chief, not judge Brosberg. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3084.44s)]
*  All right. I'm sorry. I got to take a, I got it. Bo's Bo's Burke. I got to take a quick break. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3090.0400000000004s)]

*  feels it. Most people are spending money on probiotics that don't even work. Why most [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3115.8s)]

*  spring break. So this isn't I'm not in my studio and I was asking if I could get a coffee in here [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3266.76s)]
*  and this is what they brought me. This is so sad. Look at this tiny little I said these people are [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3273.1600000000003s)]
*  obviously not in news. No self-respecting news person would ever just have a tiny little espresso [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3279.64s)]

*  envy me. Yes, that's respectable. I appreciate that. Okay. Before we leave the topic of lawfare, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3292.92s)]
*  we have to talk about Chief Justice Roberts. So like I had a nowhere yesterday. I couldn't believe [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3300.44s)]
*  it when I saw the statement circulating on X. I'm like, did he just drop this? Like this wasn't in [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3308.04s)]
*  a case. It wouldn't know. He just decided now would be a good time to drop this. Now I will say in his [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3315.48s)]
*  defense, but I'm, I'm not defending this. Trump tweeted out that judge Boasberg should be impeached [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3321.24s)]
*  and, you know, said all the stuff. He's a hack, whatever. Well, Trump, Trump's done that, you know, [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3328.6s)]
*  he's constantly criticizing judges. This is not the first judge he's done that to. Did anybody [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3333.56s)]
*  watch what happened during the lawfare? So Roberts came out around noon yesterday with [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3337.0s)]
*  a following statement, quote, for more than two centuries, it has been established that impeachment [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3342.84s)]
*  is not an appropriate response to disagreement concerning a judicial decision. The normal appellate [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3348.92s)]
*  review process exists for that purpose. By the way, in a potentially ill timed motion that came late [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3355.56s)]
*  in the day, there was a Congressman who moved to impeach judge Boasberg, which is, it's like a little, [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3364.2s)]
*  it's unfortunate when you've done that. And then within moments, the chief justice has said, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3370.7599999999998s)]
*  this isn't appropriate, but it kind of gets to the very nature of what's wrong here, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3374.4399999999996s)]
*  which is it's really not for chief justice Roberts to say rich. I mean, I respect the chief justice. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3378.7599999999998s)]
*  I respect what he does for the country, but Congress is in charge of whether a judge gets impeached. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3385.56s)]
*  And it's really not any of his damn business. Yeah, totally agree. By the way, this puts paid [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3392.04s)]
*  to the conspiracy theory that had a brief life after the address to the joint session of Congress, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3398.2s)]
*  where Trump said, you know, appreciate it on a hot mic to, to, uh, Judge Roberts, you know, [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3403.16s)]
*  always remember. And I was like, oh, it's the immunity decision that he's thanking him for, [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3409.88s)]
*  where he actually look at the full tape. He's thanking everyone as he goes down the line, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3413.96s)]
*  your generals and other justices. So Trump later said he was saying he was thanking the chief [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3417.72s)]
*  justice and those words for swearing him in, but yeah, for swearing him in. So this was, this is [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3423.24s)]
*  really, really dumb because one, he's not going to get impeached, right? So there's, there's not, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3428.2799999999997s)]
*  maybe you can make the case if, if he's on the verge of getting impeached the first time the [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3434.52s)]
*  judge is going to get impeached for not corruption, but for, for one of his, his rulings or actions, [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3438.8399999999997s)]
*  maybe the chief justice would feel compelled to speak out, but he's just responding to a Trump [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3444.44s)]
*  criticism of this judge, which was lurid and over the top and all caps and calling for him to be [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3449.7200000000003s)]
*  impeached. But if the chief justice is going to get into the business of rebutting the president [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3455.2400000000002s)]
*  United States, every time he criticizes a judge, the chief justice is never going to shut up, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3459.88s)]
*  right? He's going to be very busy. And these are cases that are going to come up to him and his [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3464.12s)]
*  court. So what if the, you know, this didn't happen. Trump didn't take the debate, but what [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3468.68s)]
*  happens if Trump hits back at the chief justice, right? And you get a war between the president, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3473.96s)]
*  a war of words between the president and the chief justice. You speak, if you're a justice of the [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3478.3599999999997s)]
*  court, you should, you know, they do book tours and whatnot, but you should speak largely through [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3483.24s)]
*  your opinions. You're well-considered opinions when you've considered everything carefully, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3488.6s)]
*  has come up to you appropriately and is something in your ambit. That's your role. [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3492.9199999999996s)]
*  So this, this was at the very least imprudent from the chief justice. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3497.96s)]
*  And not only that, Charlie, but judge Boasberg is a big boy. He's the chief judge in the district [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3502.92s)]
*  of Columbia. It's right underneath the DC circuit, court of appeals. He can take the president's mean [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3508.68s)]
*  tweets and he can handle a congressman saying he ought to be impeached and starting impeachment [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3514.2s)]
*  proceedings, which Rich is right, will go nowhere. Why is chief justice John Roberts, protect, [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3519.2400000000002s)]
*  pretending like he's got to be the daddy of this judge or any other when he's been remarkably [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3524.04s)]
*  silent when justices came under death threats, when Chuck Schumer was on the steps of the [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3530.68s)]
*  Supreme court threatening them that they would reap the whirlwind. When judge Aileen Cannon [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3536.6s)]
*  was being attacked relentlessly for handling the Mar-a-Lago documents case, including threats of [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3541.72s)]
*  impeachment. I don't remember him releasing statements, setting the record straight on how [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3547.24s)]
*  an errand federal district judge ought to be handled back then. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3553.56s)]
*  So I guess I'm just belligerent today, Megan, because I disagree with you both on this as well. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3557.88s)]
*  First off, Schumer did. After Schumer made that terrible statement about the whirlwind, [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3562.36s)]
*  Roberts did put out a statement. He condemned it and made a similar statement to the one he [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3568.44s)]
*  made yesterday. So he does have the history of doing this. Yeah. So first off, I think it's [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3573.88s)]
*  consistent with the way that he's acted as chief justice. Second, if it's inappropriate for someone [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3579.32s)]
*  who doesn't work for the legislative branch to opine on impeachment, then it's inappropriate [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3584.76s)]
*  for Donald Trump to do it. So if Donald Trump comes out as the head of the executive branch and [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3589.96s)]
*  says we should impeach justices, well, it's reasonable in response, in my view, for the [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3595.8s)]
*  head of the judicial branch to say, no, you shouldn't. Why? Congress is, of course- [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3601.7200000000003s)]
*  You of all people, you love the Constitution. This is a remedy. Congress has the right to impeach [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3609.56s)]
*  federal judges. Right. But John Roberts did not say that it is illegal for Congress to impeach it. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3613.96s)]
*  He didn't say that if Congress- It's been established that it's not an appropriate response. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3621.48s)]
*  No. What he said was actually correct constitutionally and historically. It's [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3627.08s)]
*  not that Congress cannot impeach justices or judges if they want to. It's that they should not do so [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3631.72s)]
*  on the grounds of pure disagreement. I mean, we presumably all think this because we, the three of [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3639.96s)]
*  us, spent four years railing righteously against the Democrats for trying to pack the court simply [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3646.8399999999997s)]
*  because they didn't like the opinions of the majority. Congress can pack the court. It's [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3653.96s)]
*  allowed to do that, but it's totally reasonable for people to say, don't pack the court just [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3658.84s)]
*  because you don't like Clarence Thomas or you don't like Alito. So I think for the judiciary to say, [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3664.36s)]
*  hey, we don't do that. We don't impeach people based on their opinions only for being wildly [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3671.48s)]
*  corrupt or what you are. That is for the Democrats in Congress to say. That's what the Democrats [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3679.96s)]
*  should say in response to this motion to impeach that's been filed by this Republican congressman. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3686.12s)]
*  He's not Democrat in chief and he's not the daddy. This is one of the problems with Chief Justice [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3692.12s)]
*  John Roberts. He's not the daddy of the judiciary. He's not. His oath is to uphold the constitution [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3697.3199999999997s)]
*  and he too often, must we go back to Obamacare, decides to maneuver in a way that would [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3704.2799999999997s)]
*  protect the court as opposed to in a way that would uphold the oath. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3711.4s)]
*  You'll find no argument for me if you want to criticize some of John Roberts's opinions, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3716.52s)]
*  but I think that if you look at the presumption undergirding our constitutional order, [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3721.0s)]
*  is that it's that ambition will counteract ambition and each branch will protect itself. [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3725.32s)]
*  And actually the big problem that we have at the moment is that that is very often not true. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3730.36s)]
*  So to me, when I see someone like Trump criticize the judiciary, although I think he's sometimes [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3735.4s)]
*  wrong on the merits and I don't often like the way that he does it, that's fine. When I see, [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3740.92s)]
*  I wish we'd see more of it, Congress criticizing the president, including the president's use of [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3745.8s)]
*  powers that the president has and indisputably is able to exercise. I think that's fine. And if I [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3751.32s)]
*  see the judiciary defending itself and saying, actually, no, even if it's not true, actually, [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3756.84s)]
*  no, this judge is good and we don't talk like that and you should not impeach us for our opinions. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3761.32s)]
*  I think that's fine. I think that is Madisonian in nature. Now, if those branches usurp the power of [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3765.7200000000003s)]
*  others or interfere in ways that are extra constitutional or unconstitutional, then I will [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3770.76s)]
*  have a huge problem with it. But John Roberts chastising Chuck Schumer in 2020 or responding [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3775.88s)]
*  to criticisms of Boasberg and calls for his impeachment, it just doesn't bother me. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3781.6400000000003s)]
*  It's very different. Speaking up against a threat. I mean, that's like a direct threat against [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3786.44s)]
*  justices is one thing. I mean, I didn't remember that he did that, but that just knowing it is [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3790.2000000000003s)]
*  completely appropriate because they were being threatened by the majority leader of the Senate. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3795.5600000000004s)]
*  But that's, this is not what's happening. This is a procedure that's available to Congress to [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3800.2s)]
*  impeach a rogue federal district judge, which is what many people think about Boasberg right here, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3805.0s)]
*  given the discussion that you and I just had. And it's not for John Roberts to weigh in. Maybe [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3809.48s)]
*  he'll get his time on the Boasberg decision, but this is not the time. And I'll tell you, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3814.4399999999996s)]
*  I agree more with Mike Davis who tweeted out the following dear, dear chief justice, John Roberts [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3820.2s)]
*  for more than two centuries. He's playing off of the words used by Roberts. It has been established [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3825.32s)]
*  that impeachment is a political decision by Congress. An activist judge ordering planes [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3830.6000000000004s)]
*  to turn around during a national security operation is not a judicial decision. It is a [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3835.6400000000003s)]
*  highly illegal and extremely dangerous sabotage of the presidency, which is an impeachable offense. [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3841.0s)]
*  Your statement is not an appropriate response. The normal impeachment process exists [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3847.7200000000003s)]
*  for that purpose. And here's just one more, which I would love to ask you about, Rich. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3852.04s)]
*  Julie Kelly writes for more than two centuries again, Congress has abdicated its oversight role [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3855.88s)]
*  related to the federal judiciary, creating a crisis of confidence among the American people [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3862.6s)]
*  that is quickly destroying trust in the third branch of government. And she, right, fixed it [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3869.32s)]
*  for you to Roberts. But I think that raises a very interesting point and captures the angst and anger [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3874.04s)]
*  so many Americans are feeling right now as these judges try to stop the Trump agenda [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3882.04s)]
*  in its cradle with decisions like the one we kicked the show off with by Judge Reyes, right? [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3888.2s)]
*  That there is a federal judiciary creating a crisis of confidence by overstepping their remit [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3894.68s)]
*  and then absolutely no oversight role being exercised by Congress or by anybody else, [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3903.16s)]
*  where that's her frustration and it's the frustration of a lot of Americans. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3909.4s)]
*  Yeah. So first of all, I love this National Review Day, Charlie versus Megan. I love the [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3914.84s)]
*  throw down we're having here. Look, I think Roberts is right on the merits. I don't think [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3920.36s)]
*  it'd be a good idea to just go and impeach judges for their opinions unless they're mentally ill [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3924.36s)]
*  or something or just not competent to carry out their duties or they're found with gold bars in [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3931.96s)]
*  their suit pockets the way Senator Menendez was. I just don't think he should have said it. I don't [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3937.32s)]
*  think it helps the standing of the Supreme Court that he's so concerned with justifiably. But [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3943.0s)]
*  Senate confirms judges, right? That is part of our system. But we're not going to impeach [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3950.28s)]
*  these judges. There's never going to be the votes for it. So at the end of the day, this is a real [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3958.04s)]
*  side show. Yeah, there's not going to be the votes for it, but they're trying to make a point that he's [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3962.84s)]
*  way out over Esquisse. I mean, yesterday what we saw was the ACLU feeding him the questions that [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3968.52s)]
*  they wanted the DOJ to answer about these planes. And he just did it hook line and sinker. This is [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3972.52s)]
*  what the ACLU wants to know. You better answer it. And so now we have the commander in chief [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3977.7200000000003s)]
*  removing gang members from the country, having to answer to the ACLU exactly when, where, why, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3982.92s)]
*  who, all of it. And again, it's very controversial given the discussion that happened in the first [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3989.88s)]
*  hour of this show. Okay. On the subject of lawfare, one of the people that Trump is trying to deport [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=3995.08s)]
*  is Mahmoud Khalil, who was a Columbia University student, who was the spokesperson for a very [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4004.76s)]
*  controversial group on campus called the Columbia University Apartheid Divest Group. And that was [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4011.1600000000003s)]
*  the group that took Hamilton Hall hostage, committed tons of property. I mean, we showed the video on [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4015.88s)]
*  Monday, but I mean, less people forget it was extremely riotous, broke the windows with hammers. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4021.08s)]
*  They threatened Jewish students. They didn't allow Jewish students to get from A to B on campus. [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4027.08s)]
*  We could go down the list, but very controversial stuff. And he was their spokesperson saying, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4031.2400000000002s)]
*  you divest from Israel, Columbia, or you get more Hamilton Halls. That's how this is going to go. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4035.0s)]
*  Now he wants to play the victim and the left is only two happy to help. He's got some 19 lawyers [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4039.7200000000003s)]
*  representing him for free. Well, he decided to write a letter guys, dated yesterday. It's long, [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4045.56s)]
*  but I'll read just a couple of highlights. My name is Mahmoud Khalil and I am a political prisoner. [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4052.12s)]
*  I write to you from a detention facility in Louisiana where I wake to cold mornings [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4058.2s)]
*  and spend long days bearing witness to the quiet injustices underway against a great many people [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4063.24s)]
*  precluded from the protections of the law. Writes about how he was allegedly accosted along with [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4069.24s)]
*  his wife by the DHS agents. When he got to 26 federal Plaza, I slept on the cold floor. He's [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4074.76s)]
*  obsessed with the cold. He should go back to Syria. It's very warm there. He's going to be much happier. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4081.1600000000003s)]
*  In the early morning hours agents transported me to another facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4085.88s)]
*  There I slept on the ground and was refused a blanket. Despite my, I'm telling you the man, [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4090.76s)]
*  he doesn't, he shouldn't be here. The Northeast in March is no place for Khalil. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4097.16s)]
*  Um, my arrest was a direct consequence of exercising my right to free speech. [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4102.84s)]
*  Uh, he talks about how he was born in a Palestinian refugee camp in Syria. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4109.48s)]
*  My unjust detention is indicative of the anti-Palestinian racism from both the Biden [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4113.08s)]
*  and Trump administrations. Um, et cetera. Okay. He says they're determined to support Israel with [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4118.92s)]
*  weapons to kill the Palestinians, blah, blah, blah. Uh, he goes back to the racism president, [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4126.12s)]
*  Shafik Armstrong. He's talking about Columbia authorities and D and the dean laid the groundwork [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4131.08s)]
*  for us government, the us government to target me by arbitrarily disciplining pro-Palestinian [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4135.8s)]
*  students arbitrarily, he says, and, um, allowing viral doxing campaigns based on racism and [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4141.08s)]
*  disinformation. Columbia targeted me for my activism, activism, creating a new authoritarian [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4147.72s)]
*  disciplinary office to bypass due process and silence students criticizing Israel. That sounds [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4153.8s)]
*  just like Columbia, doesn't it? And then he ends it by saying the Trump administration's targeting [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4159.48s)]
*  me as part of a broader strategy to suppress dissent, visa holders, green card carriers, [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4165.0s)]
*  and citizens alike will all be targeted for their political beliefs. Uh, this comes as a US district [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4170.5199999999995s)]
*  court has just decided that they will not let this case be heard in the Southern district of New York. [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4179.5599999999995s)]
*  Which is what Khalil wanted, nor will they let it be heard in Louisiana, which is what the DOJ wanted. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4189.719999999999s)]
*  They will have it be tried in the district court in New Jersey, which was the government's fallback [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4196.5199999999995s)]
*  because they brought him to New Jersey after detaining him in New York. So it's sort of a split [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4202.599999999999s)]
*  the baby situation, but I think the Trump administration could be happy with New Jersey over [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4207.16s)]
*  SDNY, which is pretty far left. Uh, your thoughts on whether he has been detained because of racism [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4211.4s)]
*  and Columbia worked to set him up and deprive him of his right to free speech guys. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4219.32s)]
*  Well, it's preposterous, but it's the political views you'd expect of this guy. At least it didn't [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4228.04s)]
*  use the word that some have used to describe his detention, which he's been taken hostage. I believe [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4232.759999999999s)]
*  if I'm not mistaken, that might've been his wife's statement that was read from the courthouse steps [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4238.36s)]
*  last week, which is just perverse from people who were down. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4243.32s)]
*  What's that? But it wasn't read by his wife. It had a woman. Everybody thought that was the wife. [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4249.0s)]
*  She read the wife's statement. It wasn't the wife. Yeah. Yeah. The statement was from the [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4254.36s)]
*  wife was read by someone else, but these are people that have torn down flyers of, uh, a picture with [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4259.16s)]
*  pictures of, of Israeli hostages who've never said anything about Israeli hostages who were literally, [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4264.28s)]
*  you know, pulled from their houses, their, their beds, their children held in dungeons. They're not [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4270.44s)]
*  just cold, right? Uh, uh, heinous acts of violence being perpetrated against them. And this guy who [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4276.2s)]
*  is an immigrant to the United States, as Marco Rubio has eloquently stated, has no right to be [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4282.76s)]
*  here. Charlie can speak to this, um, fulsomely by the way, if you're an immigrant, a legal immigrant [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4287.32s)]
*  on a visa, a tourist student visa, or even a green card holder, you are obsessed, uh, if you're a [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4293.4s)]
*  normal person with abiding by every single, uh, law and rule. You don't want to park on the wrong [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4299.0s)]
*  side of the street because my, what might happen to you in this guy, you know, there's a cognizance [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4305.48s)]
*  of guilt, right? Megan, he said, well, I don't go in the media very much because I'm an immigrant [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4310.599999999999s)]
*  here and I might get in trouble. I don't want to get in trouble because who knows what could happen, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4315.5599999999995s)]
*  right? And it's, it's happened. So it's entirely on him. And it kind of ties back to the first [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4319.48s)]
*  segment on the trans issue in the military. You don't have a right to be a member of the military [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4323.639999999999s)]
*  and you don't as a foreigner have a right to be in the United States. So I'm sure it's not pleasant [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4328.12s)]
*  to be in a dissension facility in Elizabeth, New Jersey, but he brought him on this on himself. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4333.96s)]
*  And this is something I think it's a, it's a bit of a close call, but I think ultimately another theme [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4339.08s)]
*  and our discussion today will be based on the determination of Marco Rubio that it's against [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4344.44s)]
*  the national security interests of the United States to have these protests, creating, creating [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4349.72s)]
*  a false image of what we are and what our priorities are. And he was a leader in that effort. So goodbye. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4354.84s)]
*  I think you call that the, the King's card in your discussion with Andy on his podcast, [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4361.4800000000005s)]
*  which that's well said. Yeah. That that's despite all the debates over the laws and the rules and [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4365.56s)]
*  the way you can deport somebody, et cetera, the Marco Rubio has this ACE in the hole, which says [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4372.68s)]
*  there is an explicit statute saying the secretary of state can deport you if he thinks that you pose [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4378.120000000001s)]
*  a reasonable threat to the foreign policy of the United States. That card has been played on [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4382.6s)]
*  Mahmood Khalil. It's over and no one cares how cold he is without his blankie. He took the, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4387.32s)]
*  he took the campus of Columbia university hostage and acted as a spokesperson for the group that was [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4394.12s)]
*  threatening a lot more mayhem. Charles. I mean, it doesn't matter whether it was actually charged as [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4400.919999999999s)]
*  a crime by Alvin Bragg, what he was doing very much looks like extortion and conspiracy under [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4406.5199999999995s)]
*  the criminal law to me. And you don't even have to prove that I have to prove is Marco Rubio made [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4413.32s)]
*  a reasonable determination. I think Marco Rubio is reasonable determination will prevail here. I do [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4417.5599999999995s)]
*  suspect this might take a while though, because there are a bunch of complicated questions that [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4424.92s)]
*  will come up the works. One is whether or not what he engaged in was speech. I think a lot of it was [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4430.36s)]
*  not. But the half the country thinks it was. And then there's the fact that he has become a [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4436.6s)]
*  green card holder and a green card holder is a US person. They can still be deported. But the [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4444.04s)]
*  criteria for deportation is much narrower. And of course, he has an American wife who is pregnant, [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4450.4400000000005s)]
*  and I think she's eight months pregnant. So in one month, irrelevant father of an American citizen. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4456.120000000001s)]
*  No, well, it isn't it isn't in that it's going to come up the works, though, I think. But I think [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4461.5599999999995s)]
*  Marco Rubio's explanation is- Here we go again, C Squared. Let's do this. It's irrelevant. It's [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4466.5199999999995s)]
*  something that they use to pull on the hard strings of the judge. But it has absolutely no [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4472.2s)]
*  legal relevance that you're married to an American or about to have an American baby. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4476.12s)]
*  Well, it doesn't. It doesn't in that we've been discussing some judges who are bad, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4479.879999999999s)]
*  and who are willing to put themselves in the way of the Trump agenda based on flimsy pretexts. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4484.6s)]
*  And until you meet a judge or excuse me, a panel of judges who is not doing that, then this is [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4492.12s)]
*  going to grind on. I mean, I think it could take a year as it winds its way through the system. And [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4498.84s)]
*  I think some of the questions and we'll find out who's right, I suppose. But I think some of the [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4503.48s)]
*  questions that are going to be litigated here are what constitutes the rights of a US person, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4508.6s)]
*  which is a green card holder, whether it matters that he was a US person after the various actions [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4513.24s)]
*  were taken. Well, no, I mean, of course, US person is a term of legal art, which you know, [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4521.96s)]
*  but it's not synonymous with American citizen. It's not. I mean, you're not allowed to get [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4527.4s)]
*  public benefits. You're not allowed to vote. There are all sorts of rights that the three of us have [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4532.44s)]
*  as American citizens that he doesn't have. Correct. But for example, and I'm not actually [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4537.4s)]
*  arguing with you here, even if I sound like it. But for example, a US person is allowed to own [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4542.2s)]
*  a gun. I know this having been a US person before I became a citizen, you can own a gun. And the [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4546.76s)]
*  Supreme Court has ruled that right of the people to keep in bear arms applies to US person. So [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4551.0s)]
*  there will be a judge, I promise you this, there is going to be a judge who looks at this, says the [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4557.0s)]
*  First Amendment supersedes Marco Rubio's argument and that as a US person, he is protected. Oh yeah, [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4561.48s)]
*  there could be a judge. In all of his activities. I just think that's going to be gummed up for a while. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4567.08s)]
*  One of the reasons that Democrats and the left are getting all these favorable rulings is because [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4572.2s)]
*  they're judge shopping. They're making sure that they file these cases in the most leftist [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4576.12s)]
*  jurisdictions that they possibly can and trying to get a good judge. That's why they wanted this [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4580.76s)]
*  case with Khalil to stay in the SDNY. It's why they're thrilled with Judge Boasberg, [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4586.76s)]
*  Judge Chong, who just did the USAID ruling. All these people are left-wing appointed judges. And [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4592.28s)]
*  so they're thrilled. But unfortunately for them, we have a Supreme Court that right now is 6-3 [[01:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4600.12s)]
*  with the conservatives, notwithstanding Chief Justice John Roberts and Amy Coney Barrett, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4604.2s)]
*  who's been slightly soft. So we'll see how she does. But I think in the end, [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4608.68s)]
*  I feel like Coney Barrett will do the right thing. I don't know about the chief judge. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4614.44s)]
*  And that's a 5-4 ruling in President Trump's favor on, I think most of his agenda, which will be [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4617.64s)]
*  ultimately upheld. Okay, let's keep going. That's Khalil. He was not held because of racism. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4623.8s)]
*  He was certainly not held because of some discrimination by the Columbia University [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4629.16s)]
*  administrators. Good God, they let them hold the university campus and abused Jews for months. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4633.88s)]
*  I mean, it just went on and on and on. And now he's got the nerve to claim this is racism against [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4641.16s)]
*  him. He's assimilated in that respect, right? It's the most American thing in the world to [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4646.68s)]
*  accuse our own country of racism. Good point. We've got to spend a minute on, [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4653.24s)]
*  as long as we're talking about double standards, Tesla and Tim Walsh. We got to talk about Tesla [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4658.5199999999995s)]
*  and Tim Walsh. So Elon Musk's company and Elon Musk are under attack from coast to coast. There's [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4666.12s)]
*  this new campaign to vandalize Tesla vehicles, Tesla dealerships, to key, you know, when you take [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4673.719999999999s)]
*  your key and you scrape, you scratch, which is very expensive to fix the side of a Tesla car. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4683.08s)]
*  Some people are throwing Molotov cocktails at the Tesla vehicles. And again, we've seen even vehicle [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4689.0s)]
*  dealerships targeted. This is Elon Musk is quickly becoming the left's favorite target, even more so [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4695.96s)]
*  than Hitler, fascist, orange man, bad Trump. And what we saw, what we're seeing now is some Democrats [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4702.5199999999995s)]
*  sound awfully close to defending those attacks on Tesla and the dealerships. You know, they're [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4711.96s)]
*  smart enough not to say that explicitly, but they're sounding awfully close. Before I get to Walsh, [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4719.72s)]
*  here's left-wing operative and Hillary Clinton BFF, Neera Tanden versus Scott Jennings on CNN [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4724.68s)]
*  last night. And that's the American left right now. It is one angry mob after another willing [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4731.88s)]
*  to take things into their own hands up to and including keying, firebombing, and otherwise [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4738.04s)]
*  vandalizing cars and car dealerships and charging stations. It's outrageous. So when they do it to a [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4742.68s)]
*  Tesla dealership, it's really bad. But when they do it to the halls of Congress, we should pardon them. [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4749.24s)]
*  Is that your position? No, I've never. Are we okay with the 10-year-ceas part? I know you haven't [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4755.8s)]
*  been around for a while, so let me educate you about my position about January the 6th. I'm so [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4760.68s)]
*  sorry. Let me educate you. So let me educate you about my position. You want to attack me? Let me [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4764.36s)]
*  finish it. Let me finish it. Let's do this January 6th and then near it. I'm sorry you're getting [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4769.24s)]
*  emotional. Yeah, I'm sorry you're a condescending person who hasn't been paying attention to what [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4774.599999999999s)]
*  I do. I have repeatedly, just like my friend Ashley here, said that no violence in our political [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4777.96s)]
*  system is acceptable. But this right here, what's going on with a guy who helps our country, who runs [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4784.44s)]
*  successful companies, who doesn't have to be doing this, and now one of his companies is under [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4789.8s)]
*  systematic terroristic threat and violence all over the country and people seem to be laughing [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4794.84s)]
*  about it or fine with it. It's outrageous. Anyone who commits violence against Tesla or Congress or [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4799.8s)]
*  anyone else should be put in jail a thousand percent. But that should not stifle dissent or [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4806.84s)]
*  opposition from Elon Musk. Give it a little lip service. Give it a little both sides. I'm so sorry [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4813.24s)]
*  to say that people are legitimately upset. They're legitimately upset. And they're doing [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4818.28s)]
*  it on their own, but there is no reason to have violence in the country. But I just wish all of us [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4824.92s)]
*  would support criticism of or would support punishing people who are violent wherever they are. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4829.96s)]
*  So they're very upset. They're legitimately upset. They're doing it on their own. And we [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4839.08s)]
*  should really be condemning January 6th in this moment as well. Your thoughts on that one, Charles? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4845.24s)]
*  She just can't do it, can she? All she has to say, all she's obliged to say as the citizen [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4852.04s)]
*  of a free republic is it is never acceptable to firebomb cars because you don't like the guy who [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4858.36s)]
*  owns the company. And she can't do it. Joe Biden, by the way, nominated her for a federal position. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4865.4s)]
*  Thankfully, the Senate shot it down. Joe Manchin, I think, saw sense. But she cannot do it. And that [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4871.16s)]
*  is because at the root of modern American progressivism is the suspicion at best and [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4879.639999999999s)]
*  the conviction at worst that violence is sometimes justified, that riots are necessary, and that all [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4889.639999999999s)]
*  these power dynamics and hierarchies of grievances that we've been treated to for years [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4897.4s)]
*  justify what we see on the streets often and here at car dealerships. It's absolutely astonishing to [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4902.44s)]
*  me that she can't do it. And the newspapers, incidentally, have published headlines over and [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4909.639999999999s)]
*  over again that run a little bit like Neera Tanden's answer there, which is suggesting that Elon Musk [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4915.879999999999s)]
*  has angered people and therefore that they can't be held responsible if they resort to violence. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4923.88s)]
*  It's appalling. Rich, we did have the almost vice president of the United States, Tim Walz, [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4930.12s)]
*  decide to weigh in on this. And here's what he had to say in response to Elon Musk. I mean, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4939.96s)]
*  obviously in response to Elon and what he's doing with the federal government and all that. But [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4947.08s)]
*  here's what he decided while Tesla's under attack, while Elon's under attack. This is his [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4950.28s)]
*  message yesterday. Saying on my phone, I know some of you know this on the iPhone, they've got that [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4954.759999999999s)]
*  little stock app. I added Tesla to it to give me a little boost during the day. 225 and dropping. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4958.5199999999995s)]
*  And if you own one, if you own one, we're not blaming you. You can take dental floss and pull [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4972.36s)]
*  the Tesla thing off and take out just telling you. So your thoughts on that as this is one of the [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4978.36s)]
*  largest American manufacturers and employers of Americans that we have, but he's celebrating [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4985.0s)]
*  the drop in stock. This, not to mention as Elon Musk rescues our two astronauts who were stuck [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4990.36s)]
*  on the international space station. It's just your thoughts. Yeah, it's meant to punish and coerce [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=4995.16s)]
*  Elon Musk. And this whole campaign is loathsome and non-American. I was fine, obviously, to protest [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5000.92s)]
*  if it's peaceful and lawful. Let's find a boycott. There's a boycott against Bud Light a year or two [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5006.76s)]
*  ago, but I don't remember Bud Light delivery trucks getting Molotov cocktailed or 7-Elevens getting [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5011.400000000001s)]
*  shot up. So this is a low level, it's not hijacking planes, but it is a low level form of domestic [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5018.2s)]
*  terrorism, the basic definition of which is violent acts that are ideologically motivated and meant [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5024.2s)]
*  to change the course of a government or government policy. They want to make Elon Musk afraid. I don't [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5030.84s)]
*  think he scares easily, but they want to make the people who work for him afraid. They want to make [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5038.4400000000005s)]
*  the potential customers afraid. They want to make the people who own the cars afraid. The last thing [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5041.64s)]
*  you want to think of is my car might be vandalized. This is an expensive vehicle. So whenever the left [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5047.0s)]
*  talks about direct action, you need to take measures to protect your person and your property. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5054.92s)]
*  And that they're celebrating this or can't condemn it is utterly contemptible. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5061.4800000000005s)]
*  And speaking of the left's celebration of violence, here's another soundbite. This one is still Tim [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5067.4800000000005s)]
*  Walls, but it's on Gavin Newsom's podcast Tuesday. You got to respect people you disagree with, [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5073.4800000000005s)]
*  even, and you can't just dismiss people. This notion of, well, this notion of tucks. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5080.44s)]
*  I think I could kick most of their ass. I do think that. But I don't know if we're going to fall into [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5086.5199999999995s)]
*  that place where we want to, okay, we challenge you to do a, you know, a WWE fight here type of thing. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5092.839999999999s)]
*  It's a natural reaction. I think it's one of the reasons we're losing so many men. And again, [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5100.2s)]
*  it's multi-ethnic. It's not just white men. We're losing them. We're losing them to these guys [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5103.799999999999s)]
*  online. That's why I brought these are bad guys though. These are bad guys, but they exist. And [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5108.52s)]
*  we could deny they exist. They exist. Not only they exist, they persist. And they're actually [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5114.120000000001s)]
*  influencing young kids every single day. How do we move some of those guys back under a rock? [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5118.52s)]
*  I think we have to first understand what their motivations are. I think we have to understand [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5123.4800000000005s)]
*  what they're actually doing. And I think that's racism and misogyny. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5127.88s)]
*  Oh my God, there's so much in there. I'll start with you on it, Rich, since Charlie and I have [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5133.240000000001s)]
*  done a lot together that there's everything in there, right? Like I'm going to kick their ass. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5137.64s)]
*  Okay. Sure. Sure. Jan. These are bad guys, the online influencers. He's clearly talking about, [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5143.320000000001s)]
*  you know, sort of the Manosphere that helped get Trump elected. They're bad. And then the, [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5150.280000000001s)]
*  how do we kick them back under a rock? The leftist instinct to silence always there when it's not [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5155.56s)]
*  their POV. And then just the cherry on top, it's all, they're all racists and misogynists. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5161.48s)]
*  You couldn't like, if I sent you into like a back room with a bot and you were to program it, [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5167.959999999999s)]
*  to say the things that the left believes about the right half of America, that's what you'd come out [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5173.719999999999s)]
*  with. Yeah. And that was the guy they selected that was supposed to appeal to ordinary Americans [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5177.32s)]
*  and to rural men. Tim Walz. When he says push under a rock, it's consistent with what we heard [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5182.5199999999995s)]
*  from him about the first amendment, which he totally doesn't understand and says that it bans [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5187.96s)]
*  hate speech, right? So this is ultimately where they want to go. They want to censor and coerce. [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5193.64s)]
*  So I'm not a big Gavin Newsom fan. Obviously the guy is way too slick, but the project here, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5199.8s)]
*  I don't know if sure whether, not sure whether it's going to work out for him politically, [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5206.12s)]
*  but the project to at least understand, that's a huge step forward. And that big debate between [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5209.08s)]
*  Walz and Newsom, Newsom is right. Let's understand what's going on and maybe find out a way to [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5214.68s)]
*  appeal to these people. Once you know why they've gone to what they consider the dark side, [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5220.84s)]
*  but Walz is with the left. No, they're horrible. They're racist. They're misogynist. Nothing to [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5226.4400000000005s)]
*  learn, nothing to understand. We're righteous and they need to go away. And that's the attitude. [[01:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5232.360000000001s)]
*  I mean, we've seen it for a long time for the left, but it was the attitude that sunk Hillary [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5238.04s)]
*  Clinton in 2016 and they're still not over it. It's not solvable for them, Charles. They can sit [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5242.68s)]
*  there all day long. Tim Walz thinks the answer to losing young men as voters is for him to be like, [[01:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5252.200000000001s)]
*  I'm going to kick some ass. I'm going to kick the ass. I'm going to do it. As opposed to the way [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5256.52s)]
*  they talk about men, the way they talk about white men, their policies when it comes to white men [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5263.8s)]
*  getting jobs and getting ahead and treating them like their second-class citizens, not to mention [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5270.04s)]
*  the irony of these two dudes, these two governors talking about like how we've lost all these young [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5275.64s)]
*  male voters who are literally running the most insane leftist states in the union when it comes [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5283.16s)]
*  to the trans insanity and trans so-called trans children. I mean, like the policies, [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5291.16s)]
*  Walz is the only one further to the left than Gavin Newsom when it comes to what can be done [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5297.72s)]
*  with a child who expresses gender confusion. He made Minnesota a so-called trans sanctuary state [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5303.64s)]
*  where the state can rest custody from a parent who won't quote affirm. Gavin Newsom, [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5310.12s)]
*  right there, I mean a sliver behind him in California. And these two are like, well, [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5317.88s)]
*  we just have to figure out how we're losing voters, especially men by the droves. Gee, [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5322.92s)]
*  maybe we need to have more tough talk about kicking ass. Yeah, it will never cease to be [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5328.28s)]
*  weird that having put together a ticket that consisted of Kamala Harris and Tim Walz, [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5335.08s)]
*  the Democrats went on a two-week offensive where they described verbatim JD Vance as being weird. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5341.88s)]
*  Tim Walz is one of the most weird people I've ever seen in politics. I've lived in two countries. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5349.080000000001s)]
*  I've spent some time in a third, France, which is well known for having strange politicians. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5356.040000000001s)]
*  And Tim Walz may well take the cake. He also can't decide there, which I think is genuinely [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5361.0s)]
*  interesting, whether or not he wishes to condemn what he sees as toxic masculine men or emulate [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5366.6s)]
*  them. It's an odd thing to do to say we need to put them under the rock. They're bad people. [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5375.64s)]
*  Those sort of men have no place effectively in our politics. But to start the segment saying, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5381.8s)]
*  I'm going to kick their ass because the vast majority of the people he's talking about would [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5387.96s)]
*  not say that. Now, if you threaten their girlfriend, they'll tell you they'll kick your ass, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5392.280000000001s)]
*  but they wouldn't start with that. That wouldn't be the opening gambit. So he seems somewhat [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5396.92s)]
*  confused as to whether he wants to eradicate them or to become them. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5401.72s)]
*  This is such a good point. This reminds me of there was a friend that Doug and I had. It was [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5406.76s)]
*  someone I knew professionally. And we wondered whether he was gay because he never had girlfriends [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5413.240000000001s)]
*  and he was a very good looking guy. And just there were a lot of gay men in our lives, our friends [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5421.72s)]
*  who were like, is he gay? Is he gay? Anyway, he used to run around and say to Doug and to our other [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5425.64s)]
*  male friends when he had an alleged girlfriend, she looks amazing naked. You should see her naked. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5433.64s)]
*  And Doug and his guy friends would say, that's not how straight men talk past the age of 19. [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5440.280000000001s)]
*  That too is gay is really what they were saying. And I think you're onto something there about Tim [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5448.280000000001s)]
*  Walls, right? Actual tough guys are not like, I'm going to kick his ass. I'm going to kick their [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5454.84s)]
*  ass based on nothing. You know, who else did it a lot was, and I'm not suggesting anything, [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5460.2s)]
*  Joe Biden, right? He's this tottering old man who barely stand up anymore. And he'd be talking to [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5466.84s)]
*  her, I'll take you down. Let's have a push up contest. It's this false bravado and masculinity [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5471.400000000001s)]
*  overcompensating. So true. Okay. I'm still stuck on my story. I saved this one. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5479.56s)]
*  I really want Charles's viewpoint on this because I think you're both are going to like it. And I [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5489.160000000001s)]
*  think you both heard it, but I really want to hear what Charlie has to say to another Charlie. This [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5493.64s)]
*  one goes by Chuck, his last name Schumer, and he appeared on the view and had some real thoughts [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5498.360000000001s)]
*  on the evils of the right in his view. Here he is in sought five. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5505.08s)]
*  The Republican party is a different kettle of fish than it used to be. And that's why we're fighting [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5512.2s)]
*  them so hard. They are controlled by a small group of wealthy, greedy people. And you know what their [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5517.4s)]
*  attitude is? I made my money all by myself. How dare your government take my money from me? I don't [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5524.12s)]
*  want to pay taxes. Or I built my company with my bare hands. How dare your government tell me how [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5530.04s)]
*  I should treat my customers, my, the land and water, water that I own or my employees. They [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5535.88s)]
*  hate government. Government's a barrier to people, the barrier to stop them from doing things. They [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5543.16s)]
*  want to destroy it. We are not letting them do it. And we're united. For the listening audience, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5548.84s)]
*  he ends it with his fists in the air. Once again, like when he tried to get that chant going, [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5556.84s)]
*  we're gonna win and no one joined him. He just thinks if he raises his fists in the air, [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5561.72s)]
*  somehow it's going to inspire us. Charlie, your thoughts on that? [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5566.68s)]
*  Well, I think if I were the Republicans, I would already be looking to run that in 2026 in the [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5571.24s)]
*  midterms. And look, that is one of the Democrats' big problems. They just believe that the people [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5577.16s)]
*  who pay the vast majority of taxes, if you look at our progressive tax system, the people who [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5590.92s)]
*  create economic growth and invention, the people who really do service the backbone of the private [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5597.0s)]
*  sector are the problem. And their suspicion of big government is ungrateful. And they've been [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5605.8s)]
*  doing this for a long, long time. This didn't start with Chuck Schumer. Barack Obama used to do this [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5614.6s)]
*  with his whole, you didn't build this nonsense. Elizabeth Warren talks like this. You can go back [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5619.96s)]
*  a hundred years and you'll find Democrats talking like this. Now, it's not the case that Americans [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5624.6s)]
*  on average are as free market oriented as I am. And I'm aware of that. I am much more free market-y [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5629.959999999999s)]
*  than the average American. But I think this is in some way related to the previous clip that you [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5636.679999999999s)]
*  just paid, which is that a lot of Americans, they do have a certain get up and go, especially [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5642.839999999999s)]
*  the young men you're talking about who feel that they want to go out there and express themselves [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5649.48s)]
*  without being told that they are the problem. Now, it's not that I'm saying men are more [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5653.5599999999995s)]
*  entrepreneurial than women, but I'm saying that women don't tend to be told they're the problem [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5657.72s)]
*  by the Democrats, but men do. And if you combine the message that we just saw from Tim Walz with [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5661.16s)]
*  the message that you just saw from Chuck Schumer, it's essentially go away, go under a rock, don't [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5668.6s)]
*  create anything, don't innovate, don't take risks. And if you do, we're going to take the money that [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5675.240000000001s)]
*  you generate from them. And I think that together those messages are why a lot of young men, and it [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5680.84s)]
*  seems to be disproportionately non-white young men for all Tim Walz's accusations of racism and [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5686.68s)]
*  misogyny, the group that moved the most in the last election was young men of color. Those people [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5692.4400000000005s)]
*  are the ones who are put off by this message. So I think they're going to have to shift because I [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5699.8s)]
*  don't think that's how you win back the country. Your thoughts on it, Rich? That's just pathetic. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5704.68s)]
*  Look, I think Schumer made the right call on avoiding a government shutdown, but he's just [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5711.16s)]
*  kind of been exposed as not very good at this. And there's something about the Senate that creates [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5714.68s)]
*  certain kind of leaders. They take on the aspects of the institution. Now, it's true of Mitch [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5721.320000000001s)]
*  McConnell. Republican base didn't like Mitch McConnell, even though he was very good at his [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5726.280000000001s)]
*  job in the Senate, but he wasn't going around pumping his fists and trying to pretend like he [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5730.84s)]
*  was something he wasn't. And that's what Schumer's doing, just like Tim Walz is when he's saying he's [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5735.64s)]
*  going to kick people's asses. I will say at least this is a cartoonish version of what a lot of [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5740.44s)]
*  Republicans or Elon Musk wants or thinks. They're not Nazis. So Elon Musk is a techno libertarian, [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5748.36s)]
*  but people are spray painting swastikas on his car because they just think if anyone's on the [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5754.919999999999s)]
*  right and they disagree with them, therefore they must be a fascist or Nazi. At least this is a [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5760.04s)]
*  cartoonish version of the way entrepreneurs or libertarian leaning Republicans think, but it's [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5764.04s)]
*  still cartoonish. And Chuck Schumer just doesn't, you know, I think AOC would be an idiot not to [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5772.92s)]
*  challenge him in that Senate primary coming up several years away now, but I think she should go [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5779.16s)]
*  for it. Yeah. These guys are so out of touch and just embarrassing themselves. I mean, the more, [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5784.04s)]
*  the better. Tim Walz should stay out there talking and Chuck Schumer too. I guess he doesn't realize [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5790.36s)]
*  how uninspirational he is. The thing with Tim Walz, like we're going to kick their ass. All [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5796.04s)]
*  I could think of when I listened to him was that viral video that was on YouTube when YouTube was [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5800.04s)]
*  really first taking off with that little girl. And she's like, he's going to come out of the movie. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5804.599999999999s)]
*  He's going to kick my ass. Right? Remember that one? The mom's kind of laughing. Like you can't say [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5809.4s)]
*  that. You say, but anyway, that's who he sounded like except far less cute. Okay. We've got to get [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5813.88s)]
*  to this incident on CNN, which I've been promising the audience for days and it just haven't been [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5821.24s)]
*  able to get to. Bill Weir, who is a far left radical climate activist, is the chief climate [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5827.16s)]
*  correspondent on CNN and he covers as a result, EPA and now Lee Zeldin at EPA. And he went on [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5835.56s)]
*  Caitlin Collins show late last week with a quote, fact check of an EPA press release about what [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5846.04s)]
*  they're doing over there as they try to reform or really kind of undo some of the extreme quote [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5855.240000000001s)]
*  reforms that Joe Biden put into place. Here is what he reported. They were putting out press [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5861.24s)]
*  releases with such a flurry, about 31 different actions and rollbacks that some of them had typos [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5867.719999999999s)]
*  or placeholders at the top. We have one of those there. Trump EPA announces zero, zero, zero. You [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5873.4s)]
*  can see there it's sort of shoot first, fill out the press release later. EPA administrator, [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5879.0s)]
*  the guys were shaking their heads for the listening audience. EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5888.68s)]
*  took to X the very next day writing another media fact check face plant where the fact checker [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5893.64s)]
*  doesn't have the slightest clue what he is talking about. And he says, these aren't zeros. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5901.0s)]
*  They are the letter O, O, O, O, O is not a typo says Lee Zeldin 40 CFR code of federal regulations, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5908.12s)]
*  part 60 sub part O, O, O, O or quad O is a federal regulation under the clean air act. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5917.88s)]
*  And then goes on to explain exactly what they are doing. They are, they're letting people know that [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5926.68s)]
*  they're about to have open debate on whether the EPA can, as Lee Zeldin feels, change those increased [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5932.84s)]
*  standards that the Biden administration put on, I think it's methane producers, but in any event, [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5941.0s)]
*  Charlie, your thoughts on Bill Weir's so-called fact check as the CNN resident expert on these issues. [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5946.04s)]
*  Yeah, well, I'm glad you use the word expert because for years now there's been this back and [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5954.839999999999s)]
*  forth in the courts between the law as it was written by Congress and the EPA's interpretation [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5959.24s)]
*  of it. Thankfully, many of the cases have gone the way of congressional will in recent years, [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5964.92s)]
*  but every time they do, we get these dissents from people like Elena Kagan and Sonia Sotomayor in [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5971.72s)]
*  which they laud the experts in the community and say we should just be giving them carte blanche [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5976.76s)]
*  to do whatever they want. And then we see one on television absolutely be clowning himself. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5984.360000000001s)]
*  And we realize why we have the system that we have. It's very, very embarrassing. It is also [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5989.56s)]
*  what happens when for years you know that the media is on your side and just will reflexively [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=5997.0s)]
*  back you and publish your talking points as if they were facts. You become lazy and flabby. I [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6003.64s)]
*  think the average press secretary for a Democrat is worse than the press secretary for a Republican [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6009.0s)]
*  because they're just not used to doing the work. They're just not used to the hostility [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6014.92s)]
*  that sharpens people. That was a good example of it. And I'll just use this opportunity to say [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6020.36s)]
*  Lee Zeldin is one of the best of the nominations that Donald Trump made and seems to be doing an [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6025.24s)]
*  incredible job at EPA, not only in policy terms, but in making sure that all of the work that he's [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6032.12s)]
*  doing is legitimate and the i's are dotted and the t's are crossed. I think when this administration [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6037.88s)]
*  is over and we look back on the story of it, we will say that the EPA appointment and conduct was [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6046.36s)]
*  probably one of the best parts of the whole thing. This is what happens, Rich, when your left-wing [[01:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6053.08s)]
*  activism blinds your obligations as a reporter. Yeah, well we all have our moments and I wouldn't [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6059.08s)]
*  have known what all those O's are, but I'm not an environmental reporter. So this is hugely embarrassing [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6067.24s)]
*  and Lee Zeldin, I agree with Charlie, he's great. Now you got to be careful because the first time [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6074.28s)]
*  around a lot of great stuff happened to EPA as well and it all got reversed because it wasn't [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6079.16s)]
*  careful enough. So hopefully Lee Zeldin is dotting his i's and crossing his t's there. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6083.24s)]
*  But I would also, I wouldn't think like O's would be a natural stand-in for something that's going [[01:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6089.24s)]
*  to be filled in. You'd leave something blank, you'd have underscores, or the journalistic way to do it [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6094.28s)]
*  is a capital T and a capital K. So yeah, we're a little more careful here. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6099.639999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing though, so this guy Bill Weir, I don't know if you guys are probably, nobody's [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6107.16s)]
*  familiar with him because no one knows who he is, but he being in the business and on cable news, [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6112.280000000001s)]
*  I've been watching this guy for years and he is as rabid a partisan as they come. He was at ABC, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6118.4400000000005s)]
*  now he's at CNN and I want you to know just how rabid. Okay, let me just start with his climate [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6124.92s)]
*  activism and just radicalism, all right? Charlie and Rich, you both have young kids, imagine doing [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6131.96s)]
*  this to your child on Earth Day, all right? He published a letter on CNN.com to his son River [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6138.52s)]
*  marking the child's fourth Earth Day where he warned of mass extinction and here's what he wrote, [[01:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6146.04s)]
*  April 22nd, 2024, this is just past April. There are still dark days to be sure and since you love [[01:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6153.08s)]
*  animals so much, I can't bring myself to explain just how many of your favorites are on Extinction's [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6159.8s)]
*  Brink and while technology in the hands of the soulless can divide us, it can also connect the [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6165.400000000001s)]
*  helpers in ways that can save entire ecosystems. This is a follow-up to his 2020 version of his [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6172.6s)]
*  letter to his then newborn son where he wrote, quote, the milk in your bottle was warmed by dirty, [[01:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6179.320000000001s)]
*  ancient fuels and as a result, you will learn to walk on a planet that has never been this hot for [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6186.44s)]
*  humans. Charlie, is that what you wrote to your babes when they were first born? It's not. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6194.36s)]
*  You know, the other thing, aside from being borderline child abuse in its content, it's so [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6203.799999999999s)]
*  overwrought, it's embarrassing. That's what I would write as a parody. If you told me, you know, [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6208.2s)]
*  there are people who do this, come up with the letter. I think I'd be nervous about publishing [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6214.76s)]
*  that for fear that it seemed unbelievable. Your dirty milk by terrible fossil fuels. So that's [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6222.2s)]
*  how he talks to his son. Rich, you have a newborn baby. I'm sure you're writing her letters just like [[01:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6231.24s)]
*  that. You probably have to run right now to do it. Yeah, what does Rear give his kids? Like a dead [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6235.48s)]
*  polar bear. Sorry, you know, dead stuff polar bear. Sorry, this polar bear is dead, but you know, [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6240.84s)]
*  that's just the world you live in. This is one of these beats, Megan. Like every climate reporter [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6245.16s)]
*  in the country, probably if they haven't written those sort of things to the kids, they think it, [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6250.92s)]
*  right? It's like covering gender or misinformation or disinformation. There's not one honest, straight, [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6255.0s)]
*  objective journalist who ever ends up on a beat like that. Yes. All right. So he ultimately was [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6262.76s)]
*  forced after being publicly shamed to issue a correction on CNN, which he did. That's good. [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6269.64s)]
*  That's a bare minimum that's required of people. But if you look at this guy's actual reporting, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6275.64s)]
*  taking away his mental deficiencies as evidence in those letters, it's of course, completely biased, [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6280.360000000001s)]
*  pro Obama, Biden, anti Trump. And I've got to just show you these, these couple of examples before we [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6287.0s)]
*  go. All right. Here he is. Just see if you can tell me if you can spot the difference in the way [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6293.0s)]
*  he reported on Trump, which will play first versus Obama, which we went back and just pulled some of [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6298.76s)]
*  his coverage of the Obama inauguration. We're going to play these two back to back 24 and 25. [[01:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6306.4400000000005s)]
*  These are such vital years right now that we're dealing with. And then this new administration, [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6311.96s)]
*  not only ambivalent about the science, but almost antagonistic. So we'll see, we'll see [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6317.08s)]
*  who was able to hold the line. Now for anybody who remotely cares about land and water and animals [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6323.96s)]
*  and climate, this is an obvious choice. They live in two different planets on planet Trump. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6329.88s)]
*  There are no gigafires out West. Miami is not flooding. There are no experts telling us that [[01:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6335.72s)]
*  this is just the beginning of a new normal. I think things are bad now. Imagine the hell on [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6340.76s)]
*  earth that would be three degrees of global warming. Well, Donald Trump is basically saying [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6346.04s)]
*  go to hell, go to that hell because he doesn't want to even acknowledge the existence of the [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6353.96s)]
*  problem. Well, Charlie, we know that wind can make a cold day feel colder, but can national pride [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6358.6s)]
*  make a freezing day feel warmer? It seems to be the case because regardless of the final crowd [[01:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6365.08s)]
*  number estimates never have so many people shivered so long with such joy from above. [[01:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6371.56s)]
*  Even the seagulls must be all the blanket of humanity. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6380.04s)]
*  He's a terrible writer. Also, was he trying to do a Churchill thing? I mean, that was right at the [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6388.12s)]
*  end. He was trying to paraphrase Churchill. About the seagulls? No, he said never before, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6395.32s)]
*  which is the line that Winston Churchill used after the Battle of Britain, an air campaign that [[01:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6402.04s)]
*  quite literally saved Britain from Nazi invasion in 1940. So he's transplanted that into a [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6406.76s)]
*  description of the inauguration of, I presume, Joe Biden. No, Barack Obama. Oh, nine. Oh, [[01:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6412.52s)]
*  Barack Obama. Okay. But it's just that it's such a great example of how these people's priorities [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6418.2s)]
*  are all out of whack. Literal existential survival of the British Empire gets moved over onto the [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6424.68s)]
*  same plane as Barack Obama becomes president. Just insanity. Could you believe that, Rich? [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6431.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's a parody. And they can't just say that, you know, the science suggests if the [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6438.52s)]
*  projections are true that 50 years from now, 100 years from now, keep warming this way, [[01:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6444.84s)]
*  natural disasters will marginally be worse. I mean, it's always hell is upon us. Every single [[01:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6451.0s)]
*  natural disaster is directly caused by climate change. It's kind of like COVID in that the [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6457.64s)]
*  people who are most supposedly committed to the so-called science get over their skis and [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6463.160000000001s)]
*  ignore the science to make the most hysterical politicized case for the policy outcomes they [[01:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6469.240000000001s)]
*  want. Yeah, the seagulls must have been awed by the blanket of humanity, he reported at the [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6475.240000000001s)]
*  Barack Obama inauguration as opposed to Trump. He wants us to go to hell. [[01:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6482.92s)]
*  Seagulls are just looking for a stray sandwich they can snatch. That's the seagull play. They're [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6488.12s)]
*  not awed by anything. That's exactly right. Anybody who's been to the beach, including Jersey Shore, [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6494.28s)]
*  knows that. It's really incredible. And that's why I would submit for the record that Bill Weir's [[01:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6499.32s)]
*  quote mistake on Caitlin Collins, which by the way she shared in, was no mistake at all. It was an [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6504.28s)]
*  agenda masquerading as journalism, which is why he got humiliated. Charlie Cook, Rich Lowry, [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jPdJxmBf-Nk&t=6510.12s)]
