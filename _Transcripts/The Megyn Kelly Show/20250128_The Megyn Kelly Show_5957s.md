# Next Deportation Actions, and RFK's Nomination Battle Ahead, w/ Tom Homan, Halperin, and Turrentine
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [January 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and our new normal. So much news overnight to bring you. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=0.0s)]
*  We begin with the single biggest issue of the Trump 2024 campaign, the promises on which he's making good by the day, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=7.0s)]
*  securing the US southern border and fixing our broken immigration system. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=14.0s)]
*  In just the first week of Trump's presidency, immigration and customs enforcement has arrested more than 3500 illegal immigrants. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=19.0s)]
*  ICE has conducted operations in multiple states across the country with a focus on national security and public safety threats. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=26.0s)]
*  It is incredible to see our brave law enforcement officers taking action to make our country safe again. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=33.0s)]
*  And joining me now for the first time, the man behind the entire operation, President Trump's border czar, Tom Homan. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=40.0s)]
*  As President Trump begins his new administration, one of the top Democrats in Congress aiming to undermine the Trump agenda is Senator Dick Durbin. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=56.0s)]
*  And according to our sponsor, the Electronic Payments Coalition, Senator Durbin has a new scheme of government takeover of your credit card. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=63.0s)]
*  Today, Americans have thousands of choices in credit cards, but they say Senator Durbin's plan will result in less competition and less security. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=69.0s)]
*  That means more risk for your credit and your identity. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=76.0s)]
*  Learn more at www.electronicpaymentscoalition.org and consider telling your senators to stop Dick Durbin's government takeover of your credit card before it's too late. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=79.0s)]
*  Tom, welcome to the show. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=91.0s)]
*  Hey, thanks for having me. I'm a big fan. I've been following you. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=93.0s)]
*  You're a stone cold patriot, so I'm happy to be here today. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=97.0s)]
*  That means a lot coming from you, Tom. I'm a huge fan of yours as well. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=101.0s)]
*  I'm almost reluctant to keep you off of what you're doing for 30 minutes, but we have to do it because you have to keep us updated on what's happening because it's just delightful to hear about all these bad guys finally getting swept up and kicked out. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=105.0s)]
*  Let me start with this. Is that about right now, the running total? Are we about $3,500 or are we up to $5,000 now? Where are we? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=117.0s)]
*  I think we're beyond $4,000 as of today, but I don't have the exact numbers with me. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=127.0s)]
*  But look, you said it right. We're operating throughout the country, concentrating on exactly what you said, public safety threats and national security threats. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=131.0s)]
*  And there's some collateral arrests, but that's what you got to expect in sanctuary cities. We can't arrest a bad guy in the jail. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=141.0s)]
*  We got to go to the neighborhood and find him. If he's with others, others that may not be a criminal priority, but they're in the country legally, they're coming too. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=147.0s)]
*  So we've arrested a lot of bad guys. A lot of public safety threats have taken off the streets. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=154.0s)]
*  So Chicago, New York, Denver, they're all safer cities today because of what I said. And numerous agencies, right? We got DEA, FBI, ATF, US Marshals, HSI, ERO. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=159.0s)]
*  So a lot of these cities are safer today, but we're not done. We're just getting started. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=170.0s)]
*  How do you figure out, because I know you're prioritizing right now the ones who are also criminals on top of the illegal immigration criminal problem that they have, but they've committed a murder, they've committed a rape, they have child pornography, something like that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=174.0s)]
*  So how do you find these guys, Tom? I mean, like, was this on the table for Joe Biden's team all along and it was just a matter of, like, picking up the files and going to get them? [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=189.0s)]
*  Exactly right. Look, ICE is really good at this. These people don't want to be found, but there's ways to find them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=198.0s)]
*  I can't speak to the specifics because it's law enforcement sensitive, but they could have found these people last year, but the administration simply tied ICE's hands. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=205.0s)]
*  And first time in the history of my career, starting back in 1984, ICE had handcuffs on them. So President Trump, he kept his promise to American people. We caught ICE loose day one. Day one we're out there. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=214.0s)]
*  And they're able to go arrest targets. They could have arrested the last four years, but weren't allowed to. But we've opened that aperture and they're out doing the job now. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=226.0s)]
*  Is it going to be harder or easier when you move on from the criminal criminal phase to the, they're just criminals because they broke our immigration laws phase and start getting those folks? [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=233.0s)]
*  Actually, I think it's going to be easier. The reason I say it's easier because criminals, they're street smart. They know how to hide. They know how to play the game. They don't cat and mouse game. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=245.0s)]
*  But as we open that aperture up, as we look for the 1.4 million illegal aliens in this country who had due process and great taxpayer expense, they've been order removed by federal judge, but simply didn't leave. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=255.0s)]
*  They're not as street savvy as the criminals are. So I think the arrest will increase as the aperture widens. But again, we want to take every public safety threat, every gang member off the streets. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=267.0s)]
*  So we're really concentrating on that right now. But the aperture will open and the operation will expand throughout the nation. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=280.0s)]
*  Do we have an idea of how many are in the first group of truly bad hombres you're getting who have committed other crimes? [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=287.0s)]
*  Over 600,000 illegal aliens are walking the streets of this country with a criminal conviction. So we have a big trunch that we need to go find. So there's no lack of business. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=295.0s)]
*  And that is why President Trump's vision was all of government. That's why we have DOD with us standing shoulder to shoulder soldiers on the border. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=305.0s)]
*  That's why we have DEA, FBI, ATF, US Marshals helping on these operations throughout the cities, because the more resources we get from the other agencies, the more teams we can create. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=314.0s)]
*  Each team, you only need one or two people with immigration enforcement authority, Title 8 authority, to actually make the arrest legally. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=324.0s)]
*  The rest of them can be law enforcement officers that cover the back door, address officer safety concerns, because it takes a whole team to arrest somebody on their turf who they have access to who knows what weapons. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=331.0s)]
*  So it's just exactly what we're doing. We're not hiding it. I've been talking about this since day one. We're out there. We're not going to apologize for doing it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=344.0s)]
*  All the government approach. It makes sense, especially I just I just got back from Chicago. I actually was up there on that operation and it was great to see. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=351.0s)]
*  We find it. We find alien with dope. We've got DEA to prosecute the case. We found TDA members with guns. We get ATF prosecute the case. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=359.0s)]
*  And of course ICE, they prosecute their own immigration rather to re-enter the deportation, which is a felony. But having all those resources at table, not only we arresting the bad guys, we're criminally prosecuting them first, then we'll deport them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=367.0s)]
*  You know, it's amazing is you have such support for what you're doing right now. You sit down with the left wing media and you would never know that the vast majority of the American people are 100% behind you and what you're doing right now in particular. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=379.0s)]
*  The vast majority of Americans want illegals deported period, irrespective of whether they've committed another crime while here. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=392.0s)]
*  But when you ask them, how about those who actually have criminal records? Listen to this New York Times, Ipsos poll, New York Times, Ipsos poll January of 2025. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=399.0s)]
*  87% of Americans want immigrants who have who have committed crimes deported. That includes 83% of Democrats. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=409.0s)]
*  83% AP, NORC poll January 2025. Do you support deporting all immigrants who are here illegally who have been convicted of a violent crime? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=420.0s)]
*  You've got 89% of Republicans, 77% of independents, 79% of Democrats favor that. I mean, it's just a clear mandate what you're doing right now. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=430.0s)]
*  But what we get instead is these sanctuary cities like Chicago boo-hooing Tom Homan so mean he's sending these terrible agents into our children's schools to harass eight year olds, which isn't true. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=438.0s)]
*  Let's just start with that. What they've said about what you did in Chicago is a lie. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=452.0s)]
*  Exactly. Thanks for cities, these politicians. I don't care what they say. I don't care what they think of me. I've never cared what people think of me. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=455.0s)]
*  I'm going to do the job and you can you can fear monger all you want to call me all the names you want. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=461.0s)]
*  I'm going to get this job done for the president who's given a mandate by American people. So continue to hate. I'm OK with that. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=466.0s)]
*  If I get the live in their minds rent free, that's kind of cool. But look at the whole thing in Chicago. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=472.0s)]
*  You got the governor of Pritzker on social media talking about ICE agents raiding an elementary school. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=478.0s)]
*  And he says, I'm putting fear in the community. What a ridiculous statement to make. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=483.0s)]
*  As a governor, you think he'd make a phone call and ask on the truth on this because he's the one that's scaring the immigrant community. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=487.0s)]
*  He's the one that's scaring children and thinking we're going to raid elementary schools. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=494.0s)]
*  Look, I've made it clear. We have taken a sense of location policy and flushed it down the toilet. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=497.0s)]
*  Why? Because I said the only law enforcement agency in the nation who had these type of requirements, we can't operate in a hospital or school or or other sensible care. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=502.0s)]
*  A courthouse, for God's sakes. Right. I've been in courthouses many times throughout my career and I watched a father getting arrested in a courthouse for not paying child support. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=512.0s)]
*  But you're not going to ice in a courthouse rest of public safety threat or national security threat. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=520.0s)]
*  Totally ridiculous. And I said last night during my interview with CNN, there is no safe harbor for a national security threat or public safety threat in this country. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=525.0s)]
*  If they're on a college campus, we're going to go get them. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=534.0s)]
*  If it's an MS-13 gang member that's sitting in a high school someplace and he's a significant public safety threat, he's going to be arrested. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=537.0s)]
*  So there's no safe harbor. There's no sanctuary for criminals, public safety threats and national security threats in this country. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=544.0s)]
*  And that's why we got rid of that sense of location policy. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=551.0s)]
*  No one's going to raid a school. No one's going to raid a hospital. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=554.0s)]
*  But we will make arrests when we need to on a significant case. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=557.0s)]
*  I read that you think the Illinois governor and the Chicago Public Schools CEO Pedro Martinez owe you an apology for spreading these lies. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=561.0s)]
*  They came out and said, well, you read in part what the governor said, but he said after a week of Republicans sowing fear and chaos, [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=571.0s)]
*  the first reports of raids in Chicago are at an elementary school targeting children and separating families is cruel and un-American. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=577.0s)]
*  And then you had this guy, Pedro Martinez, make similar false claims. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=586.0s)]
*  Have you received an apology? [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=590.0s)]
*  No, they don't owe me an apology. They owe the men and women of ICE an apology. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=592.0s)]
*  It's like I hear last night, I forget who, talking about the Holocaust and connecting this with the Holocaust. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=597.0s)]
*  For God's sakes, what a sickening thing to say. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=606.0s)]
*  Men and women of ICE aren't making this up. They're enforcing laws enacted by Congress. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=608.0s)]
*  And I can't, I've had it hard to believe that Congress is enacting laws and passing laws they don't want enforced. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=613.0s)]
*  Not only are they enacting laws that tell ICE what to do, they're budgeting. They give us the money to do that. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=619.0s)]
*  So they owe the men and women of ICE an apology because men and women of ICE put their lives on the line every day across this country. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=625.0s)]
*  They put a gun on their head, they wear a kevlar vest, they're out there taking on the bad guys. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=632.0s)]
*  And a sanctuary is already a dangerous job, but a sanctuary city is even more dangerous because now rather than arresting the bad guy in a jail where we know he doesn't have weapons, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=636.0s)]
*  we know it's a safe transfer, now we've got to go to the streets and find him because of sanctuary cities. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=645.0s)]
*  So all the risks that these ICE agents take and all the other agencies that are involved, DEA, FBI, HF, Russell, they deserve the apology. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=650.0s)]
*  Because if they did anything in Chicago, I was there. We didn't scare children. We saved children. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=657.0s)]
*  At the last count when I left that command center, we had like seven sexual predators, mostly child sexual predators, that we took off the streets of Chicago. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=664.0s)]
*  So ICE protected children. We're not out there to demonize them or scare the hell out of them. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=674.0s)]
*  We protected children. And Governor Pritzker, you put the children at risk because not only did you lie about going to elementary school, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=680.0s)]
*  you released sexual predators of children back on the streets to re-offend. ICE is saving children. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=687.0s)]
*  Governor Pritzker has put them at great risk. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=693.0s)]
*  What actually wound up happening was it was Secret Service responding to a specific threat, reportedly, that they had received from a school. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=696.0s)]
*  And they just decided that it was ICE and to demonize you and your team because they have political reasons for doing that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=703.0s)]
*  Notwithstanding, as I say, 87% support Republicans, Democrats, independents across the board favor mightily what you're doing now [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=709.0s)]
*  and also favor by a clear majority, 55 to 60%, depending on the poll, your next step, [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=717.0s)]
*  which is going after illegal immigrants who have not been convicted of crimes. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=722.0s)]
*  Let me talk to you a bit about the numbers because 600,000 people who you know of who are here, illegal and on top of it, have committed crimes. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=726.0s)]
*  And then 1.4 million, you said, people who were adjudicated know on their asylum claims, but then we didn't throw them out. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=735.0s)]
*  We just said, oh, well, you didn't get asylum. But then Joe Biden did nothing. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=742.0s)]
*  So they just went on living their merry lives in the states. So that's two million right there. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=746.0s)]
*  And then that doesn't even count all the others who just sneaked across the border. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=751.0s)]
*  And we know they're here, but we don't know where they are. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=756.0s)]
*  So this is where I start to get depressed. Tom, I listen to you talk and I feel uplifted. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=758.0s)]
*  But then I start to get depressed because even though you guys are doing yeoman's work and you're finally all working together, let's call it a thousand a day. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=762.0s)]
*  You know, that's it's not quite there, but let's just call it a thousand a day. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=768.0s)]
*  And I did a little math, which is a stretch for me. That brings us to three hundred sixty five thousand in a year times four years. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=771.0s)]
*  That brings us to one point four six million. So that's that's less than the two million we just discussed those first two groups over four years over Trump's four years, which makes me think, ah, how are we going to get all these people out? [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=778.0s)]
*  You know, we're talking between twelve and twenty million illegals in the country right now. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=790.0s)]
*  I know it's it's it's big, but how do we digest those numbers? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=795.0s)]
*  Well, there's a lot of plans in the works. I'm working on a lot of plans, a lot of strategies. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=801.0s)]
*  But we got to bring it, like I said, the whole of government to the table, right? [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=805.0s)]
*  We got three thousand sheriffs across this country that we can easily delegate authority given to eighty seven G authority, both the G.O. model and the task force model. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=808.0s)]
*  That is a huge force multiplier. Right. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=817.0s)]
*  So if we can give them to eighty seven G authority, they can act as ICE agents. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=820.0s)]
*  Every every county in this country could those deputies could not only arrest illegal aliens based on database checking and simply run through our law enforcement support center. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=824.0s)]
*  They can actually do two eighty seven G jail models, which means everybody that goes books in the jail. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=834.0s)]
*  That's what twenty seven G is. It's colorblind. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=840.0s)]
*  Every every person is booked in jail. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=842.0s)]
*  If I get arrested and I get booked in the jail, my prints will be run to NCIC. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=844.0s)]
*  At the same time, they're running against DHS databases. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=848.0s)]
*  So if I have any history with it, war, patrol or ICE, it's going to pop up. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=851.0s)]
*  And if the two eighty seven G train facilities, they can actually process that person, hold them for immigration. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=855.0s)]
*  And we can arrest them. So we can we can certainly expand immigration enforcement throughout the country. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=860.0s)]
*  That's one plan. Another plan is we need to be out there messaging to the illegal immigrant community that look, if you're in the country legally and you haven't received a deportation order yet or you haven't been arrested yet, you need to leave the country. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=866.0s)]
*  Because if you don't, if we have to put you in the court and get a formal order removal, there's a bar that's put on you. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=882.0s)]
*  So whether it's from anywhere from five to 20 years that you can't reenter this country, you can't get a visitor's visa, you can't get a tourist visa. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=889.0s)]
*  If you have a U.S. citizen child here, he can't petition for you. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=895.0s)]
*  So you are locked out. So if you're here legally and don't have an order removal yet, leave. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=899.0s)]
*  Do things the right way. If you have a U.S. citizen child, they can petition for you down the road. [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=904.0s)]
*  But we need to keep pushing that message out. We also at South Deport, we need to push worksite enforcement. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=908.0s)]
*  Number one reason they come in. Look, nine out of ten people that come to the border claim asylum. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=914.0s)]
*  Nine out of ten is actually eighty six point seven. People that claim asylum at the border will get an order removal because they simply don't qualify for asylum. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=918.0s)]
*  They're coming here for a job or a better life. And I get that. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=925.0s)]
*  They're not escaping fear and persecution from their home government because of race, religion, political affiliation. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=928.0s)]
*  So that nine out of ten are here for a job. Worksite enforcement, we're going to hit that hard. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=933.0s)]
*  So we're going to arrest a lot of people at worksites. We need I-9s. We need to e-verify and I-9 enforcement. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=938.0s)]
*  Congress needs to get to the table. The American people have spoken. This is a clear mandate to the president. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=945.0s)]
*  Pass e-verify. If they can't get a job, they're going to go home. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=950.0s)]
*  So there's all these different programs we're going to throw in place to help us get to that magic number of getting to the non-criminals. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=954.0s)]
*  Because if there's no consequences, if they don't see people coming home, they're going to keep coming. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=962.0s)]
*  They need to see plain loads of illegal items being returned to the homeland to let them know the border is closed. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=967.0s)]
*  If you want to come to the country, there's a right way and a wrong way. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=973.0s)]
*  Go the right way because there are millions of people standing in line right now taking their tests, doing their background, paying their fees to come to the United States the right way. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=976.0s)]
*  There are thousands of tens of thousands of people in the world that really are escaping fear and persecution from the Hogan government because of race, religion, political affiliation that are sitting in the back seat. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=986.0s)]
*  So these are the systems we need to fix to drive illegal immigration to an all time low in this nation. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=997.0s)]
*  What kind of incentives, if any, should they be potentially offered to make them self-deport? [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1003.0s)]
*  I've heard smart people say we don't want to pay these people anything. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1009.0s)]
*  But if you calculate what it takes, Tom Homan and team, all the agencies you just named on a per immigrant basis, it's a lot of money that we're expending to go after these guys. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1013.0s)]
*  What if we could come up with a way like, I don't know, I'm just picking a random number like two grand if you return to Guatemala. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1023.0s)]
*  Here's a big check waiting for you. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1030.0s)]
*  Get out and get down there and we'll work with the government to make sure these people get paid. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1032.0s)]
*  I know it sounds outrageous to pay, but like better just to get them out of the country. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1035.0s)]
*  And if they could self-deport, it would make it a whole lot easier on you guys. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1040.0s)]
*  Is that crazy talk? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1044.0s)]
*  No, it's been discussed. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1045.0s)]
*  It's an option. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1047.0s)]
*  We're looking at what the pros and cons are. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1048.0s)]
*  But you're right. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1051.0s)]
*  It would save the taxpayers some money. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1052.0s)]
*  And are there things we're helping to get their affairs together, giving them a window of 30 days, the non-immigrants, non-criminals to put their affairs together and supply them with the money? [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1054.0s)]
*  And supply transportation back to their homeland. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1064.0s)]
*  There's also talk about creating real opportunity zones in those countries. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1067.0s)]
*  So when they go back, they're going back to a job. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1073.0s)]
*  Differently than every other administration, though. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1076.0s)]
*  We got to make sure the money goes to the right people. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1079.0s)]
*  This has been done. Billions and billions of dollars being sent to these countries to create opportunity zones so that people don't feel like I leave the country come back. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1082.0s)]
*  That money doesn't get where it needs to go because of the corruption of government officials and so forth. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1091.0s)]
*  So that needs to be drilled down on in the Department of State. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1096.0s)]
*  We're talking about this. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1099.0s)]
*  So what you just said, there's discussions going on. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1100.0s)]
*  I'm looking at pros and cons and what may work best, but it's not off the table. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1103.0s)]
*  We're thinking about it. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1107.0s)]
*  How would you describe what our military is doing right now? [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1108.0s)]
*  Because they're not allowed to do law enforcement. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1112.0s)]
*  But I hear that they can drive trucks at the southern border. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1114.0s)]
*  They can transport people or things. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1117.0s)]
*  So how do you see the military helping now? [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1119.0s)]
*  Because finally we have a presidential order commanding that DHS, Department of Homeland Security, and the Department of Defense coordinate to help stop this. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1121.0s)]
*  Look, and they should because I think what's happened on the southern border and even Christopher Wray, not buddies with by any means, even he agrees with me that the open southern border is the biggest national security vulnerability this nation's ever seen. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1129.0s)]
*  We know we had over two million known gotaways. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1143.0s)]
*  These people were captured on video drone traffic or central traffic. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1146.0s)]
*  We know they're here. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1149.0s)]
*  It's not a guess. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1150.0s)]
*  We got images or two million people across the border and got away. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1151.0s)]
*  They paid more to get away. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1154.0s)]
*  They didn't pay the cartels less money because cartels are charged one fee to get to the border. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1156.0s)]
*  You see a green uniform, turn yourself in cartels jobs and if you want to get away, then you want to get to New York, Chicago or into the United States without being arrested or processed across the hell with the police. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1160.0s)]
*  You know, you're going to get a lot more money. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1172.0s)]
*  So the American people need to ask themselves, why did two million people pay more to get away? [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1173.0s)]
*  Why not pay less and get a free airline ticket to the city of your choice, get a free hotel room, get three meals a day, get free medical care and get work authorization within nine hundred twenty days? [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1177.0s)]
*  Why would you pay more not to take advantage of the giveaway program? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1186.0s)]
*  Because they don't want to be fingerprinted. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1189.0s)]
*  They don't want to be vetted. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1191.0s)]
*  We've rested. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1192.0s)]
*  There's been a thirty five hundred, thirty five hundred percent increase in people on terrorist walls. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1193.0s)]
*  They're being arrested on the border. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1198.0s)]
*  Two hundred thirty, say that again. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1200.0s)]
*  Thirty five hundred percent increase in say it again, and terror watchlist suspects being arrested on board under Trump administration. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1202.0s)]
*  Four years we had fourteen. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1212.0s)]
*  There were four hundred and that's and that's just a southern border. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1214.0s)]
*  So this is a huge national security vulnerability. [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1219.0s)]
*  So I think D.O.D. is doing exactly what they should do is a national security issue. [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1223.0s)]
*  national security issue. They need to secure this country and protect our national security. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1226.0s)]
*  And so I said from day one, they're a great asset, right? Because they can do things that [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1230.64s)]
*  don't require an immigration authority, immigration officer that has a badge and gun. Transportation, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1235.04s)]
*  for instance, we can take ICE officers who have immigration enforcement authority out of the bus [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1240.48s)]
*  or out of the plane and let DOD do that. That releases more immigration officers to the streets, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1244.8s)]
*  the rest of the bad guy. They can help us with infrastructure down there putting [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1249.6s)]
*  Constantino wire up and border barriers. They're doing denial of entry. So they're being a great [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1252.64s)]
*  asset. I've done this since 1984. I started on border patrol since 1984. This weekend, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1257.92s)]
*  for the first time in my life, I saw an army plane, a military plane, removing the inland and south [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1263.2s)]
*  bound. That was a beautiful sight because it says to all of the government, all of the government [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1269.8400000000001s)]
*  is going to increase the national security of this nation and secure that border. Secure border saves [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1274.88s)]
*  lives. Secure borders helps increase the level of national security we need in this nation. [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1280.56s)]
*  There's a lot of people in this world want to hurt us and secure that border and removing the bad [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1286.32s)]
*  guys. It's going to help us be more safe. How dangerous is this work? We saw just this past [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1290.0s)]
*  weekend in, it looks like front in Texas, there was an exchange of gunfire between US border patrol [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1295.2s)]
*  agents on Monday. This was near the US Mexican border. Nobody was actually hit, but these are [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1301.6799999999998s)]
*  suspected cartel members. I just can't imagine, and here we have some video, I cannot imagine [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1310.32s)]
*  being the guys who actually have to confront the cartel members to shut this gig down. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1314.8s)]
*  It's very, look, the job's already dangerous. I mean, I was in one shooting in the border [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1320.0s)]
*  patrol back in 1987. Only if I had time, I ever had to do something like that. Most agents don't [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1324.56s)]
*  get involved in the shooting. But as I've told the White House, it's going to get worse. The [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1330.08s)]
*  criminal cartels of Mexico, no one celebrated the President Biden's election more than they did [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  because they knew they were back in business. They're making a record amount of money in sex, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1341.04s)]
*  trafficking, women, children. They're making a record amount of money smuggling aliens. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1344.7199999999998s)]
*  They're making a record amount of money moving dope in the country, especially if I'm not. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1348.6399999999999s)]
*  The President just doesn't end in terrorist organizations because he's going to wipe them [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1352.7199999999998s)]
*  off the face of the earth just like he did to Caliphate, the ISIS. He destroyed them. They need [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1355.9199999999998s)]
*  to be destroyed because they've killed more Americans than every terrorist organization in [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1361.28s)]
*  the world combined. They're not going to go away quietly. There's going to be more. We're hitting [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1365.12s)]
*  them where it hurts in the pocketbook. They don't have the money. They can't pay off the Mexican [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1369.6s)]
*  military. They can't pay off the Mexican politicians and the judges and the prosecutors. So taking [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1373.36s)]
*  their money away is angering them. We're going to put them out of business. They're going to fight. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1377.84s)]
*  They're going to go down fighting. And they're already got access to military-grade weapons. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1381.84s)]
*  They have no sense of life and respect of life. There's going to be more violence on the southern [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1386.4799999999998s)]
*  border. So I go to bed every night hoping that the men and women wearing that uniform go home [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1392.24s)]
*  safely to their families. But it's only a matter of time until that violence increases, which means [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1397.84s)]
*  we've got to give, again, put 100% focus on these cartels to put them out of business, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1404.96s)]
*  shut them down. Mexico's not going to do it. I know I get in trouble by saying that. Mexico hasn't [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1409.92s)]
*  dealt with them in three decades. And it's going to take the United States to put the cartels out of [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1415.2s)]
*  business permanently. So we've got to get that done quickly. Tom, I have to ask you, it's not just [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1420.72s)]
*  Selena Gomez. I know you've seen the clip of her crying and she got so much blowback from her fans, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1426.96s)]
*  her 422 million number of followers on Instagram that she deleted it. But I really, you're the [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1431.68s)]
*  best person to ask about what she and others like her are missing. She purports to be so concerned [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1439.1200000000001s)]
*  about the children who Tom Homan and his team are going to deport. And honestly, with all fairness [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1446.32s)]
*  to this hysterical person, I really think she's missing the full story. Here's the clip for those [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1451.84s)]
*  of you who haven't seen it. I just want to say that I'm so sorry. Only people are getting attacked. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1456.8799999999999s)]
*  The children. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1467.92s)]
*  They don't understand. I'm so sorry. I wish I could do something that I can. I don't know what to do. [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1473.3600000000001s)]

*  What is she missing? Well, look, she's famous as well as I wish she'd [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1487.04s)]
*  message Mexico and other countries that this is a way to enter the country legally. Right. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1497.76s)]
*  Quarter of America is dead from fentanyl that comes across that border. I'm sure many fans of hers, [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1505.76s)]
*  600% increase in sex trafficking in women and children. There are women and children in this [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1512.08s)]

*  not the way to come across the border. Under Joe Biden, a record number of Americans have died [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1543.12s)]
*  because of the open border policy with fentanyl. A record number of aliens have died crossing the [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1547.6799999999998s)]
*  border. 4,000 historic number of people have died crossing this border. So if you want to help, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1552.1599999999999s)]

*  If you want to save women and children, tell them not to come. Don't put themselves in the arms of [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1564.2399999999998s)]
*  criminal cartels, be sexually assaulted, abused and killed. If you want to cry, cry for the victims [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1569.36s)]
*  of an open border. I've said this a hundred times. Open borders kills, I just said it kills a record [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1576.08s)]
*  amount of Americans, record amount of migrants. But you know, a secure border saves lives. When [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1581.84s)]
*  President Trump had illegal migration down 90%, when 90% less people were coming, how many women [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1586.08s)]
*  didn't get raped by the cartels? How many children didn't drown in that river? How many Americans [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1592.0s)]
*  didn't die from fentanyl because the borders are tight and secure and the border controls are all on [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1596.08s)]
*  table? How many children weren't found in pornographic movies and sex slavery? How many women weren't [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1600.3999999999999s)]
*  forced into sexual slavery and massage parties throughout this country? How many cartel members [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1605.84s)]
*  didn't make it into this country to spread their poison throughout the nation? Thousands of people [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1610.3999999999999s)]
*  die because of open borders. So help us. You got a big platform. Help us save lives. Secure borders [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1614.72s)]
*  save lives. Those who enter the country leaving, they're cheaters. As I said, there's people in this [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1622.24s)]

*  A secure border saves lives. That's where she should be putting her anger, her sadness, everything [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1637.04s)]
*  else. Help us. We can save lives together. Tom, we watched you at a hearing. It happened years ago [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1642.96s)]
*  across from Representative Chewie Garcia, who was taking issue with your tough on the border [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1649.92s)]
*  approach and suggesting you had no heart and actually asked you, have you ever held a child [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1656.72s)]
*  in your arms? You know, a young child. And you told a terrible story about how indeed you had [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1661.76s)]
*  firsthand. You used to be a border patrol agent. You were on the front lines doing this work as an agent. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1668.4s)]
*  And I couldn't help but think of that five-year-old boy when I saw her crying for her people. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1674.4s)]
*  Meantime, we're pointing out online like Evita Duffy Alfonso, who comes on the show. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1680.4s)]
*  Selena Gomez is half Italian. She has a Mexican father who wasn't in the picture. And she says [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1684.72s)]
*  her Spanish is terrible. What does she mean? My people. I don't know where her people are. [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1688.88s)]
*  But if she's talking about her people from Latin America, from Central America, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1692.4s)]
*  you've had experience with what happens to those people as they try to cross this border [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1696.48s)]
*  in the most harrowing of circumstances. And so far, no tears for little boys like that five-year-old. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1700.24s)]
*  Well, I shed plenty of tears in that incident. That incident changed me forever. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1704.96s)]
*  And I've held many dying children. I've had dealt children. I've talked to little girls as young as [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1710.72s)]
*  nine. When you get on your knees, you talk to a little girl, nine years old, that was raped [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1714.96s)]
*  multiple times by a member of the cartel. And you get a look in her eyes and everything innocent and [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1721.04s)]
*  pure. Everything innocent and pure in her life has been stolen. And her life will never be the same. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1725.76s)]
*  That's why I fight so hard. People, why you and I are talking right now, Megan, [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1734.96s)]
*  women are being raped by members of the cartel as part of the people crossing that border. [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1740.96s)]
*  A child will die on the border tonight. So, you know, I take this job seriously because of what [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1746.24s)]
*  I've seen in my 34 years. And for the folks out there that hate me, if you wore my shoes for 34 [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1751.68s)]
*  years, you'd understand the passion. You'd understand why I think a secure border saves lives. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1756.72s)]
*  So, you know, I wrote a book, Secure Borders Saves Lives. And I meant what I said. And that's based [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1761.44s)]
*  on my experience of all the death that occurs on that border, the sexual assault of women. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1769.28s)]
*  Think about some nine-year-old little girl, grown men crawling on her, taking everything innocent [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1775.1200000000001s)]
*  and pure from her. Her life will never be the same. And that happens every day. [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1779.6000000000001s)]
*  Secure the border saves lives. President Trump's promise to American people, going to secure the [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1785.2s)]
*  border, and we're going to save a whole bunch of lives. We're going to save a whole bunch of [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1788.64s)]
*  women being sexually assaulted. We're going to save a whole bunch of Americans dying from fentanyl. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1792.96s)]
*  We're going to save a lot of U.S. citizens that aren't going to be victims of illegal immigrant [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1796.96s)]
*  crime. The president Trump has the right idea. He's like the Pentagon, and I'm like the field [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1801.6000000000001s)]
*  general. He has great vision. Him and Steve Miller. Steve Miller is brilliant. They're helping me. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1808.0s)]
*  They gave me the tools to do this with. I'm out there making sure those tools are implemented, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1814.48s)]
*  and we save this country and make this country safer. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1818.32s)]
*  Thomas, this is clearly personal to you. I've got to ask you, what was it like for you on November [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1822.08s)]
*  5th when you saw the results roll in and you realized he had won and you were going to be [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1827.04s)]
*  unleashed on this thing? I've been pissed off for four years. Every morning I get up, I'm pissed off. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1832.48s)]
*  And people ask me, I got on an airplane flight in Dallas just before the election. And the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1840.48s)]
*  captain met me in the galley because I got to ask you a question. I love you, I love Trump. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1846.48s)]
*  Because me and my wife wondered why you're always so angry when you're testifying from the Congress, [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1850.24s)]
*  and why are you so angry and do your Fox interviews? I said, I am. I'm angry and I'm [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1854.56s)]
*  pissed off because we had this lockdown. And as I said earlier, when President Trump has [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1858.48s)]
*  illegal immigration on 90%, how many women weren't being raped? How many Americans didn't die from [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1863.44s)]
*  fentanyl? How many women and children weren't in sex trafficking? I said, and they unleashed it. [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1867.28s)]
*  And I knew when Biden became president, I knew he was going to destroy everything we did, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1871.52s)]
*  the most secure board in my lifetime, open it up, which means more women are going to be raped, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1877.68s)]
*  more Americans are going to die, more rapes, more sexual slavery. So I've been angry for [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1880.96s)]
*  four years that any commander in chief would come into office and unsecure a board on purpose. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1885.84s)]
*  I worked for six presidents, starting with Ronald Reagan. Every president I worked for, even Clinton [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1889.84s)]
*  Obama, took steps to secure the board if they clearly understood you can't have national security [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1893.2s)]
*  on board of security. Joe Biden's the first president in history of the nation came in office [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1898.0s)]
*  in unsecure to border on purpose. So I was four years pissed off. The night of the election, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1901.8400000000001s)]
*  I was in monologue with the president. That's the first morning I woke up excited that we're [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1905.68s)]
*  going to save lives. And I couldn't wait to get back. Matter of fact, when the president did call [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1910.16s)]
*  me, I was the first person he called. I think I was his first election. He called me up. His [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1914.0800000000002s)]
*  first words were, oh, you've been bitching about it for four years. You ready to come fix it? [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1918.0s)]
*  Of course, and took a huge pay cut. But I'm glad I'm back. We're going to save lives. We're [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1922.88s)]
*  already saving lives. What we did in Chicago, I was in Chicago the other day, that city is safer [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1930.32s)]
*  because of ICE and the law enforcement agencies. And we're going to keep doing it. There's no end [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1935.2s)]
*  to this. This time we're going to get back to secure border we had, but this time we finished [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1939.04s)]
*  the job. Yeah. Amen. God bless you and all the men and women working with you, Tom. You're the [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1944.64s)]
*  right man for the job. We believe in you and we're really grateful for you. Thank you. Wow. Tom [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1949.92s)]
*  Holman, everybody stay safe out there. How lucky are we? Honestly, how lucky are we to have him? [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1956.72s)]
*  You've seen the combative interviews with Tom when he goes on the mainstream, whatever, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1963.76s)]
*  corporate media, and everyone's always given us such a hard time. Why don't you fucking ask him [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1967.76s)]
*  what he thinks? What his plan is? My God, that was fascinating. Just to hear what the actual problem [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1971.8400000000001s)]
*  is, what the plan is for combating it, why the problem is so bad, exactly what his motivation is. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1976.32s)]
*  This is why corporate media is such a fail, such a failure. You've got these losers on CNN looking [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1981.76s)]
*  for their star moment so they can look tough on Tom Holman. He's trying to protect you, you absolute [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1986.6399999999999s)]
*  fools. What a pleasure to have somebody like that on board and willing to run herd on this and not [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1991.9199999999998s)]
*  able to have his steel back penetrated by these barbs that these losers try to throw at him. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=1998.8s)]
*  Good luck shaking Tom Holman. He is totally the man for the job. Love your thoughts on it. You [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2005.92s)]
*  can email me, megan at megankelly.com. Wow. Feeling good. It's like every day is Christmas [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2010.3200000000002s)]
*  on Team Trump. Coming up next, Mark Halperin and Dan Turrentine are here. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2016.88s)]
*  There's a real and growing threat to your home and your equity, and it's called title fraud. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2023.2s)]
*  Here's how it works. Criminals can forge a single document, file it with a recorder, and just like [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2028.4s)]
*  that, your home is stolen. Your title of your home is stolen. They take out loans against your [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2033.12s)]
*  property, draining your equity, and you would not even know it until it's too late. Here's the really [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2038.56s)]
*  scary part. Credit monitoring will not protect you from this, but I do want to tell you about [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2043.28s)]
*  Home Title Lock to protect your home and equity. Their exclusive triple lock protection gives you [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2048.64s)]

*  Turn now to the big story in DC this week. Trump's cabinet nominees, three big ones, [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2089.12s)]
*  controversial ones, of course, finally get their hearings. RFKJ, Tulsi Gabbard, and Cash Patel for [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2094.7999999999997s)]
*  FBI. All heading to their confirmation hearings before the Senate beginning tomorrow for what [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2101.3599999999997s)]
*  promises to be some very contentious moments to watch. And I should tell you that I too will be [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2106.7999999999997s)]
*  headed down to DC after the show today because I would like to take a peek at what they do to [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2112.8s)]
*  Robert F. Kennedy Jr. I feel like this show and he have somewhat of a special relationship since [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2119.76s)]
*  I think even he would tell you he probably wouldn't be there this week if it hadn't been [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2125.6800000000003s)]
*  for the four hours we did with him. March of 2022, when no one would touch him. He was [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2130.4s)]
*  officially on the disinformation dozen list being pushed by the White House. And we found a way to [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2135.6000000000004s)]
*  get that four hour interview on all platforms, even the ones on which he'd been banned. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2140.96s)]
*  And it didn't get banned anywhere. And he will tell you that was the beginning of his road back [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2145.92s)]
*  to being sort of acceptable. It's an absurdity. I realize all that, but it had to be done. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2150.8s)]
*  And it was done. And look at him now. So I will be down there tomorrow supporting him and watching [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2156.0s)]
*  to see what they throw at him. Let's get now our guests' opinion on it all. Editor-in-Chief of [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2160.56s)]
*  Two Way, Mark Halperin and former Democratic strategist Dan Turrentine. They are both hosts [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2166.4s)]
*  of Two Ways, the morning meeting. Guys, great to have you. Great to see you. Thank you. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2171.2000000000003s)]
*  All right. So already there's some reports that Tulsi may be on a knife's edge. It may not like, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2178.48s)]
*  it's not guaranteed in other words, and that there's some Republican rumblings that she might [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2186.2400000000002s)]
*  potentially not even get out of committee. And then over on RFKJ's side, we've seen [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2190.4s)]
*  hippies after hippies starting with the big Wall Street Journal. Not surprisingly, [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2196.16s)]
*  they don't like him. The way that they're going after him though is to suggest he is making a [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2201.12s)]
*  lot of money by referrals to big law firms. He himself is a lawyer. That's how he's paid his [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2206.16s)]
*  bills for the past 40 years. Especially those law firms that are suing vaccine manufacturers like [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2211.12s)]
*  the ones who make Gardasil, the HPV vaccine, which has caused a lot of problems that people [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2217.68s)]
*  allege anyway. So they're basically saying that he's got ties that he should be more open about [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2222.88s)]
*  and that he's bought and paid for just by a different set of people, Mark. So what do you [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2228.48s)]
*  foresee happening with the RFKJ confirmation hearings, two days' worth? Well, every troubled [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2232.7200000000003s)]
*  nomination is troubled in its own way, right? And his is especially unusual because there's critics [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2238.8s)]
*  on the left, there's critics on the right. His cousin, Caroline Kennedy, just put out a long [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2244.7200000000003s)]
*  letter accusing him of all sorts of things, including some allegations that are at least [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2250.32s)]
*  new to me. I think that what you found is what I found when I talked to him, what people who've [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2254.56s)]
*  let him speak for himself have found, which is he has a lot of interesting ideas with huge resonance [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2261.28s)]
*  amongst the American people. Just what he wants to do on health, we find on Two Way, I find in [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2266.88s)]
*  talking to people around the country, has incredible resonance. And so I think that there aren't 50 [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2271.92s)]
*  votes for him, but there aren't 50 votes against him. And I think his nomination will hinge on, [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2277.04s)]
*  I think what Pete Hexett's nomination on, how does he do in the hearing? Does he come across in the [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2282.08s)]
*  hearing as a unique visionary who wants to make America healthy again? Or does he come across as [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2287.36s)]
*  a kook whose issue positions have something to offend everyone? I think if he comes in and [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2292.88s)]
*  testifies well, he'll make it. And I think if he doesn't, he won't. Dan, didn't we talk about this [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2298.8s)]
*  or did I just read you Reddit on Twitter? But one of the things I remember you saying in one place [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2303.76s)]
*  or the other was that one of the things that really helped Pete Hexett was the performance [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2309.5200000000004s)]
*  of the Democrats at the hearing. That if they had seemed more normal, perhaps his Republican support [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2313.1200000000003s)]
*  wouldn't have been so ardent and strong, but that they played a real hand in delivering him the win. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2319.6000000000004s)]
*  Yes, absolutely. I mean, I thought some Democrats in that hearing, in the Hexett hearing, [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2328.0s)]
*  completely embarrassed themselves and looked like a Saturday Night Live skit. And it really, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2332.72s)]
*  I think, forced some Republicans who had concerns to ask themselves politically, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2337.6s)]
*  do I want to be associated with that? Or do I want to be associated with President Trump? [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2343.04s)]
*  And obviously, they made their decision. I think the interesting thing here is I think RFK Jr. will [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2348.7999999999997s)]
*  get some Democratic votes. In fact, he may need some Democratic votes. And it's going to be a [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2355.04s)]
*  fine line because I think some of the Democratic questions will be, for instance, he supposedly [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2360.8s)]
*  has talked to the other day to some Democratic Senate staff that he is open to seizing patents [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2366.32s)]
*  held by pharmaceutical companies. Pharmaceutical companies and a lot of Republicans don't like that. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2371.92s)]
*  He said certain things on abortion. So Democrats, I think in this instance, may try to cause some [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2376.88s)]
*  mischief to try to drive a wedge between some Republicans and RFK Jr. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2382.0s)]
*  I think that it's going to be interesting because there's no question, Mark, that there's a lot of [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2388.0s)]
*  dirt on RFK Jr. You could go any one of a number of ways on this guy. This is like an oppo research [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2396.08s)]
*  dream, I'm sure, because he's a Kennedy. He's lived a colorful life. There's no question in [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2402.48s)]
*  the women lane, in a lot of lanes, you could land some blows. But my overall feeling, and I think the [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2408.4s)]
*  feeling of a lot of people who are pro-Maha or Maha adjacent or at least interested in what's [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2414.24s)]
*  happening over in that lane is we don't care. We want somebody to get the bad food dyes out of the [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2419.92s)]
*  food, the things that have been banned out of our makeup for 30 years because they're carcinogens. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2427.2s)]
*  We want somebody who's going to stop the revolving door at the FDA. So all these people are telling [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2431.52s)]
*  us that OxyContin is not addictive because they want to land a job with the drug maker. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2436.3999999999996s)]
*  That's the stuff we know he will fight. So I kind of approach this not the way I would have it as a [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2442.4s)]
*  Fox News anchor 10 years ago, like, oh, he did what? Now it's like, who cares? [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2448.2400000000002s)]
*  So first of all, he's led a very colorful life. That's the euphemism of 2025 so far. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2456.4s)]
*  I think he makes Pete Hegseth look like Orrin Hatch. I mean, just on the personal side, [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2462.4s)]
*  it's kind of epic. And no president, I'll say, you know, people always say in modern history [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2469.36s)]
*  or in my memory, I'm willing to say no president would have nominated someone with Bobby Kennedy's [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2473.84s)]
*  personal past in the history of the republic except Donald Trump. And Donald Trump has, [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2478.4s)]
*  as you know, warmly embraced Maha and some of these issues, not just as good politics, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2483.04s)]
*  but I think it's something that's really gotten to President Trump and the people around him. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2488.08s)]
*  So on the issue of substance, on personal stuff, disqualifying under normal circumstances, [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2492.8s)]
*  again, if he can focus on health, I think he can do well. I think it's the policy positions [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2500.4s)]
*  that are going to be equally problematic. As Dan suggested, there are some Democrats who won't vote [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2505.36s)]
*  for him on policy grounds. There's some Republicans who might not vote for him on policy grounds. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2509.76s)]
*  It's very difficult to be confirmed winning votes from both parties that add up to your margin of [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2513.92s)]
*  victory. It just doesn't happen very much in our polarized times. So if Dan's right, and he does [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2520.8s)]
*  need Democrat votes to be confirmed, it's going to be dicey. I'll say again, if he can emphasize [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2525.6000000000004s)]
*  the issues that tens of millions of people find attractive, that he espouses, as much as anyone, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2531.92s)]
*  I'll say this again, in hyperbolic terms, more than anyone in American history, he has shed a light [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2538.1600000000003s)]
*  on these issues about which many people, including parents, are so passionate. But he's got to make [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2544.0800000000004s)]
*  the confirmation about that rather than some of the other issues that are big strikes against him. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2548.88s)]
*  Because let's face it, Trump, Dan, didn't have some love for Robert F. Kennedy Jr. He wasn't like, [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2554.7200000000003s)]
*  God, I've got to have that guy. He went to him. That happened because RFKJ had something to bring [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2559.6s)]
*  to the table. He'd already been building a movement which wasn't exactly labeled Maha yet. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2564.6400000000003s)]
*  That hadn't yet happened, but he spent his whole life in the public health field just as a lawyer. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2570.1600000000003s)]
*  He's not a doctor, but as a lawyer. He's been arguing these issues. Yes, vaccines, but it goes [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2576.72s)]
*  well beyond vaccines, what he's tried to do, cleaning up the waters, cleaning up the air. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2580.7999999999997s)]
*  That's one of the reasons why so many people, including Nicole Shanahan, his running mate, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2585.3599999999997s)]
*  were attracted to him, even though by any measure, he's a little out there. But that's why Trump went [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2589.12s)]
*  to him. That's why I think he's going to get through. It's why people are going to overlook [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2594.9599999999996s)]
*  these oddities that would normally tank any nominee. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2599.4399999999996s)]
*  I totally agree with you. We hear it on our show all the time. People who voted for him or were [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2602.16s)]
*  going to vote for him love RFK. They believe in what he advocates. They believe in what he has to [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2607.52s)]
*  say. To Mark's point, he's unearthed and championed issues that at one point were fringe, that on his [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2614.0s)]
*  way out the door, the Biden administration got rid of the red dye. I don't think that happens, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2619.92s)]
*  if not for RFK. One of the things that the Democratic Party has to do is to get rid of [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2625.2s)]
*  the red dye. The other thing the Democratic Party has to do is figure out how to win back [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2631.04s)]
*  the RFK vote. We drove him out of the party. We told a lot of his voters, you're kooky. You're a [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2636.8s)]
*  conspiracy theorist. There's no place for you. Trump opened his arms, listened to what he had to [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2643.68s)]
*  say, gave it some added heft, and here he is. That's why I do think there are smart Democrats [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2650.08s)]
*  who can help us to get rid of the red dye. I think that's the way to do it. I think that's the way [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2659.28s)]

*  count on him to make some changes for people who cannot or choose not to spend their lives following [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2687.7599999999998s)]
*  these accounts and worrying about the latest thing, supplement they should take or way they [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2693.8399999999997s)]
*  should be eating to just make it a lot easier for people, especially moms and dads trying to help [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2698.4s)]
*  their children live well. That's how I see him. He'll be the most visible face trying to help [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2704.72s)]
*  those kids. This is the letter that you referenced, Mark. I'll read you in part [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2712.88s)]
*  what this is because we're going to hear a lot about it tomorrow. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2718.0s)]
*  The Washington Post has gotten its hands on a letter that Caroline Kennedy, the daughter of JFK, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2720.8s)]
*  who yes would be a first cousin to RFK Jr. has written to the Democratic senators, I guess, [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2726.1600000000003s)]
*  maybe all the senators, such as lawmakers ahead of his confirmation hearings. They say she warned [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2732.48s)]
*  the senators about him calling her cousin a predator whose victims have reigned from [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2738.72s)]
*  family members to the parents of sick children. They say she alleges that he is addicted to [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2744.48s)]
*  attention and power. I mean, grab a number in Washington has given hypocritical advice [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2750.48s)]
*  by discouraging parents from vaccinating their children while vaccinating his own children. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2757.2s)]
*  He's quite open about that fact, actually. She alleged that his crusade against vaccination [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2761.8399999999997s)]
*  has also served to enrich him. That's potentially a reference to that law firm relationship and him [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2768.24s)]
*  getting referral fees for these law firms that are suing big vaccine makers in some cases. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2773.2799999999997s)]
*  She writes, I have known Bobby my whole life. We grew up together. It's no surprise that he keeps [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2778.3199999999997s)]
*  birds of prey as pets because he himself is a predator. This is low. She goes on to claim [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2783.2799999999997s)]
*  that through the strength of his personality, other family members followed Kennedy Jr. down [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2789.7599999999998s)]
*  the path of drug addiction. This is ridiculous, you guys. Did JFK follow RFK Jr. down the path of [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2794.16s)]
*  addiction with all of his pills and his medical problems? He's the first Kennedy to invent [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2800.64s)]
*  addiction? I mean, there's long problems written about with his mom, his uncle Ted, [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2805.6s)]
*  who killed a woman and chapped acquitted. What is she trying to blame it all with RFKJ as the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2812.96s)]
*  source of the Kennedy addiction problem? His basement, this part's weird and not great. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2817.12s)]
*  His basement, his garage, his dorm room were centers of the action where drugs were available. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2822.16s)]
*  Not that part. We knew that. He enjoyed showing off how he put baby chickens and mice in the [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2827.04s)]
*  blender to feed his hawks. Ew. It was often a perverse scene of despair and violence. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2832.64s)]
*  It's not great, but I watched Sarah Palin stand in front of one of those machines that they were [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2838.08s)]
*  just chucking chickens in and one second they had their heads and the next second they didn't. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2843.68s)]
*  Like, it was kind of a discussion piece, but it didn't end her political career, Mark. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2848.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, I hope that's not the same blender they're using to make smoothies. That [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2855.04s)]
*  would just be my preference on that. It's not. It tastes like chicken. Yeah, exactly. A little [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2858.72s)]
*  protein. Rather than the vanilla whey protein, let's go with just a wing. Nothing in her letter [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2864.72s)]
*  about making Twizzlers safe again. She's not a big fan. Look, the Kennedys have always been an [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2871.12s)]
*  incredible story for the public and for journalists. The war between his cousins and his siblings and [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2878.16s)]
*  him is a very compelling story, but I'll be super curious to see it. His opening statement, I could [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2885.3599999999997s)]
*  write it in my head. What will drive this, as you suggested before with the Hegsett theory, what are [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2892.64s)]
*  the Democrats going to ask him about? What are the Republicans going to ask him about? I mean, [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2897.6s)]
*  do they really want to say, Mr. Kennedy, did you put rats in blend, mason blenders? I don't know. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2901.7599999999998s)]
*  Maybe they do. But to me, the bigger thing is, can he turn the hearing into a discussion of the [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2907.7599999999998s)]
*  issues that have struck a chord? Not just saying kids should be healthier, but analyzing what is [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2914.0s)]
*  it about corporate power? What is it about big ag power that has brought us to where we are? If [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2920.48s)]
*  he can focus on that, again, I think on the merits, he can be confirmed. But I'd be super [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2927.12s)]
*  curious to see what the senators ask because on policy and personal, there's a buffet as big as [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2932.4s)]
*  you could find anywhere in Hong Kong. Yeah. I mean, this group, NIH, Dr. Fauci was in the news [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2938.56s)]
*  over the past couple of years for tests that were being done on puppies, actual products that were [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2945.2s)]
*  being done on little puppies, beagle puppies. So, I mean, spare me with their new found animal [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=2950.0s)]

*  about Tulsi where we are hearing some concerns about this one as well. Like there's not total [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3020.88s)]
*  confidence that she's going to get through. And here too, we're starting to see the drip drip of [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3030.0s)]
*  hit pieces on her. I mean, this one that just dropped and the Daily Beast is ridiculous. First, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3036.16s)]
*  I'll just give you the color on the hill. Reports that Gabbard's path through the Intel community [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3043.2799999999997s)]
*  narrows ahead of a key hearing saying Republicans are cautioning that her path to confirmation [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3048.96s)]
*  is narrowing as she seemingly has trouble winning over key GOP senators. They're saying of the [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3057.2799999999997s)]
*  nominees yet to be confirmed, she is the one who has the most tenuous path. She cannot afford to [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3064.0s)]
*  lose a single vote on the Intel committee and they're not sure she's even got all the Republicans [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3072.48s)]
*  on it. But what we see then is a hit piece by the Daily Beast. And I'm sure we're going to see more. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3076.64s)]
*  We saw one by NBC late last week, which was more substantive or at least to try to be this one is [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3081.52s)]
*  when she was 15, they have a picture of her at an event. Let's see a ritual dedicated to Chris Butler, [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3086.8s)]
*  the leader of the science of identity foundation where she was a student at one of its boarding [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3100.0800000000004s)]
*  schools. They say this person who she was paying homage to, Butler, had ranted anti-gay [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3105.12s)]
*  hate on a tape in the late 90s. That's it. That's what we've got, Dan. When she was a teenager, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3116.16s)]
*  not even able to drive, they've got a picture of her at some guy's, I don't know, ritual. It [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3125.68s)]
*  doesn't even seem that here he was saying anti-gay things, just that he did say them. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3133.28s)]
*  And I suppose the 15-year-old Tulsi should have known exactly what he was saying at all times. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3138.5600000000004s)]
*  I always cringe whenever people bring up elected officials' teenage years. I mean, [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3145.36s)]
*  I can speak for myself. I would not want to have to defend things that I did in my teenage years. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3150.2400000000002s)]
*  But look, her problems, I think, are not with Democrats. They really are with Republicans. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3155.2000000000003s)]
*  And when Lindsey Graham this past weekend on TV had or kind of did not offer his support, [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3162.08s)]
*  it opened eyes. He is usually on Team Trump. He, on occasion, will push back a little bit. But [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3170.4s)]
*  the fact that he not only said it, was given an opportunity to kind of clean that up, and he [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3177.36s)]
*  didn't take it, she clearly has problems with some of these kind of what we'll call traditional [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3182.24s)]
*  national security Republicans. And it's interesting because Trump ran on shaking up, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3188.16s)]
*  not just the DOJ and other departments, but the intelligence agencies and how he looks at the [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3193.6s)]
*  world. And to him, she embodies that, and it's his own party that seems to have concerns. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3198.72s)]
*  Yeah. This is what's so interesting, Mark, is it's like, I think of our friend Glenn Greenwald, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3205.52s)]
*  I think of our friend Tucker, people who are very vocal about the national security apparatus, [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3211.44s)]
*  and how it's been used many times too many on the American people, how there's a great distrust of [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3219.12s)]
*  these agencies, and how they're very trigger happy in getting us, the whole intelligence apparatus, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3225.84s)]
*  and in coordination with DOJ, DOD, into these wars. And one of the reasons they like her is, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3233.92s)]
*  she's more like minded to them. She's suspicious of these tools we've used. She is not a knee jerk, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3240.64s)]
*  Putin's a devil just because he's done bad things. Is there more of a strategic aspect to be examined [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3247.04s)]
*  with somebody like that? The Bashar al-Assad meeting in Syria is going to be a big theme when [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3253.12s)]
*  she appears on Thursday, no question. But all that stuff is kind of the point of her nomination. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3259.04s)]
*  It is. It's part of why President Trump picked her. He also, like with Bobby Kennedy, very [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3265.76s)]
*  supportive of someone who switched out of the Democratic Party to back him. I think for her, [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3272.0800000000004s)]
*  as I said before, performance will be key, particularly on some of these big questions [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3277.6800000000003s)]
*  like Syria. You think back to the Hegson hearing, what helped him as much as anything else besides [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3281.6000000000004s)]
*  his performance was the chairman was in his court, and the chairman ran the hearing with an eye [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3286.7200000000003s)]
*  towards what's our strategy for getting him confirmed. Part of why Bobby Kennedy, I think, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3291.92s)]
*  has a problem as a chairman in his case is Senator Cassidy with a history of going against Donald [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3295.84s)]
*  Trump and clearly from his public statements, not enthusiastic. What I think Tulsi Gabbard has going [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3301.44s)]
*  for her is Tom Cotton, although I was surprised at how lukewarm he was this weekend. If he goes all [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3306.32s)]
*  in with her as he runs the hearing, she's being introduced by Richard Burr, the former head of the [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3312.88s)]
*  committee, the former top Republican there, retired senator from North Carolina. If the national [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3318.64s)]
*  security establishment of the party can say, yes, she's going to shake things up, yes, she's going [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3324.0s)]
*  to root out the problems of the deep state, but you can trust her to do this job to keep America [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3330.24s)]
*  safe, then I think she's got a much better chance. It has to be not she's just going to shake things [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3337.12s)]
*  up. That's half of it, but the other half is she'll keep us safe. Marco Rubio will say that [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3343.04s)]
*  as the new secretary of state. Tom Cotton, again, has been supportive, but this weekend on a Sunday [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3348.56s)]
*  show was to me, to my ear as a student of Tom Cotton, was not as supportive as he might be. [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3355.2s)]
*  I'll be super curious to see how he runs this hearing. The big story on X today is people mad [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3360.4s)]
*  that the vote on her is going to happen behind closed doors because the Intel committee is going [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3366.16s)]
*  to do one piece of the hearing in front of everybody where it'll be all swords and daggers [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3370.4s)]
*  and everybody will try to look super tough and then they'll go behind closed doors to do the [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3375.28s)]
*  classified stuff and that's where things get real and that's where they do the vote too. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3378.32s)]
*  Many people are upset because they want to know how their senator votes, but let me stick with you [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3383.44s)]
*  on this, Mark. If the vote, if she doesn't get out of committee, we're going to find out who tanked her. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3388.48s)]
*  Well, it's not unprecedented to be voted down in committee but still get a floor vote [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3394.96s)]
*  and I could see that happening in this case. One of the things about her and Megan, you know this [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3399.6000000000004s)]
*  because you know her, she's very winning personally. She comes across as a very nice person [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3404.0s)]
*  and someone you'd want to vote for just in the abstract, but she's been silent, right? She has [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3410.32s)]
*  some people helping her now who helped Pete Hagseth on his confirmation, but they have not at this, [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3416.32s)]
*  but they have not at this, you know, in the eve of the hearing, they've not switched her to [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3420.72s)]
*  publicly making the case for herself. She's following the norm. Like Pete did with me. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3425.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, exactly, like Pete did with you and with you and some of the other public statements he made. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3430.9599999999996s)]
*  I have no doubt that that's what turned it around for him by explaining in his own voice [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3436.72s)]
*  and his mom explaining in her own voice as opposed to the old letter, email, what he was about, [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3441.2s)]
*  why he should get the job. So her willingness to fight the deep state, her willingness to be a [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3447.28s)]
*  different kind of person in this job is a plus for people. I don't think the vote will end up [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3453.2000000000003s)]
*  being private. I think in the age in which we live that seems impossible, but I could imagine, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3459.2000000000003s)]
*  but I could imagine her losing Susan Collins in the committee but still getting to be voted on [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3464.2400000000002s)]
*  on the floor if all the other Republicans there vote for her. Hmm. Dan, what is the likelihood [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3470.0s)]
*  the Democrats use their time to try to make her look like a spy? Like we've heard it said by [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3477.84s)]
*  Hillary Clinton and others. And then that NBC report was all about Tulsi Gabbard did go over [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3485.84s)]
*  as a Democratic Congresswoman to visit with Bashar al-Assad in Syria. The report was that that was [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3490.56s)]
*  not the stated purpose of the trip. She was supposed to be meeting with lesser than's and [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3495.2s)]
*  that as soon as she got there, the first thing she did was go and sit down with Bashar al-Assad for [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3499.12s)]
*  three hours, which they make a big deal out of not normal for a Congresswoman. And the clear [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3503.68s)]
*  implication though, not explicit in the piece was she's a spy, but it's like, what did she then do [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3508.96s)]
*  for Syria? Walk me through how he then recruited her and turned her against the United States. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3515.44s)]
*  I don't, I, but I feel like this is where they're going to go. Yeah, there's no love loss for her [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3521.2s)]
*  in the Democratic party. I mean, it's amazing to think five years ago, she was a candidate to be [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3526.16s)]
*  our nominee. And now she is, she is on the other team. And so I think there are people who will [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3531.04s)]
*  look to get even. I think some of it will just be raw tribal politics. They don't like the fact that [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3538.08s)]
*  she endorsed President Trump, that she was so vocal in her support and so vocal in her criticism [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3544.08s)]
*  of Harris and Biden, even going back to the 2020 debate stage, she was one of Harris's toughest [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3551.2799999999997s)]
*  critics on those stages during those primary debates. And so I think I would be surprised [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3557.04s)]
*  if there are, if there is a Democrat that votes for Tulsi Gabbard, even though there are a few [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3564.32s)]
*  senators who were colleagues of her when they were in the house, I think you will see people, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3569.92s)]
*  you know, whether she's a spy or some of the things that she has said, you know, recently, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3575.44s)]
*  it's less her more Trump, they will dig in and really battle against her. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3581.12s)]
*  Does anyone here think Cash Patel is going to have a hard time getting through? [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3585.92s)]
*  No, no, because I think the party, the MAGA world will come to his defense, which by the way, [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3591.6s)]
*  they're not so far doing to Gabbard or RFK Jr. Oh, interesting. Yeah, they will fully rally around [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3597.12s)]
*  cash. I mean, the FBI, that is a hill that MAGA will die on for sure. But I think he's not going [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3603.6s)]
*  to have any trouble getting through. So we'll spend more time on him as the week progresses, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3610.7200000000003s)]
*  but not today. I want to get to some other stuff that Trump is doing. It truly is like drinking [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3613.68s)]
*  from a firehouse. He there's so much news. He's doing so much. Like we might be getting rid of [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3617.3599999999997s)]
*  the federal income tax. Like that's I, I don't know, but kind of threw it out there. Yeah, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3623.44s)]
*  okay. I think he said, yeah, listen to SOT 20, where he gave a speech last night in Doral, Florida. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3631.2799999999997s)]
*  He's going to be very rich again. And it's going to happen very quickly. It's time for the United [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3636.3999999999996s)]
*  States to return to the system that made us richer and more powerful than ever before. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3640.88s)]
*  Do you know the United States in 1870 to 1913, all tariffs, and that was the richest period [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3645.6800000000003s)]
*  in the history of the United States, relatively speaking, is that we had no income tax. The income [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3653.44s)]
*  tax came in in 1913. As I said in my speech last week, instead of taxing our citizens to enrich [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3657.92s)]
*  foreign nations, we should be tariffing and taxing foreign nations to enrich our citizens. Is that [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3664.56s)]
*  makes sense? Right. If he managed to change the constitution and, and if we got rid of [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3670.64s)]
*  the income tax mark, I think the pre the country really would keep him president for life. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3678.08s)]
*  They'd be so grateful. They'd amend it to allow him to stay forever. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3683.68s)]
*  It has great bumper sticker appeal. As you know, when you start to run the numbers, [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3688.48s)]
*  you know, they're winners and losers. And, and so people have advocated for that, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3692.64s)]
*  have to deal with the fact that it's not an easy sell. And amending the constitution about anything [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3696.72s)]
*  is basically a nonstarter because of the polarized nature of our politics. So Donald Trump, you know, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3702.3999999999996s)]
*  will float anything and, and, and see, see what people think. And this has been an issue like term [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3708.24s)]
*  limits that has really been something exciting to a lot of the center right in this country [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3713.8399999999997s)]
*  for a long time. And I'm actually surprised he didn't talk about it more when he ran in 2016. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3719.6s)]
*  I thought it was a ripe topic then and he didn't. So we'll see. He may talk about it obsessively and [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3724.32s)]
*  it may be the literally the last time he ever talks about it again, because that is the nature [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3729.44s)]
*  of Donald J. Trump. We're not done. Not by a long shot. Here's another sound bait of him yesterday [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3733.1200000000003s)]
*  in Doral, Florida, listing a bunch of stuff. Listen to SOC 23. I'll be signing four new executive [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3737.92s)]
*  orders. First is that I'm directing our new secretary of defense, Pete Hicks, that is going [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3744.1600000000003s)]
*  to be great, by the way, to immediately begin the construction of a state of the art iron dome missile [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3749.2s)]
*  defense shield, which will be able to protect Americans. You know, we protect other countries, [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3755.12s)]
*  but we don't protect ourselves. And when Ronald Reagan wanted to do it many years ago, [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3760.0s)]
*  luckily we didn't, we didn't have the technology then it was a concept, but we didn't. Now we have [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3766.08s)]
*  phenomenal technology. And next to ensure that we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3770.0s)]
*  we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3774.48s)]
*  In addition, we will stop our service members from being indoctrinated with radical left ideologies, [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3782.88s)]
*  such as critical race theory. We're going to stop it. It's already been stopped. It's already been [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3788.64s)]
*  halted, totally halted. And finally, we will offer a full reinstatement to any service member who [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3792.56s)]
*  was expelled from the armed forces due to the COVID vaccine mandate. And we will restore them [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3799.36s)]
*  to their former rank with full pay. Now, this is very popular, especially on the right, Dan, [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3805.1200000000003s)]
*  the iron dome. I mean, national review, which, as you know, this is not president Trump's number one [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3814.56s)]
*  fan group. They did a big editorial today praising him for the iron dome thing saying, there are a [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3818.96s)]
*  lot of people who think we've spent a couple billion on Israel's iron dome. Why don't we have [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3823.84s)]
*  something like that? No, we've never been attacked in that particular way. It would protect against [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3828.0s)]
*  ballistic missiles, that kind of thing, not a nuclear bomb. But why wouldn't we be looking [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3831.36s)]
*  forward at the future threats, especially in the wake of the whole drone thing? What happened to [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3837.68s)]
*  the drone story? Whatever happened to the drones? We went on Christmas vacation, everybody forgot [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3841.6s)]
*  about it. Is it still happening, my friends in New Jersey? Okay, there's that. Transgender out of [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3846.88s)]
*  military, he said the ideology, but he also means the people. Transgenders are out, pursuant to an [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3851.84s)]
*  executive order yesterday, saying, can't have it, can't be dealing with those mental issues or the [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3856.72s)]
*  leave that's needed for the medical procedures. You can't even serve in the military if you have [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3862.24s)]
*  eczema, which I didn't know. And you certainly can't serve if you've got this level of mental [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3865.6s)]
*  challenge. No more CRT, he said, DEI in the military. And that last one is very popular, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3870.24s)]
*  full reimbursement, back pay, and reinstatement to the existing rank for the some 8,000 service [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3875.2s)]
*  members who got booted because they wouldn't take the COVID jab. Your take on all of those, [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3881.28s)]
*  or does one jump out to you as most worthy of discussion? Well, I think for the Democratic [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3887.44s)]
*  Party, the challenge is there is so much, right? It's shock and awe, and the party is really on its [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3894.2400000000002s)]
*  heels. One of the things that I get in my inbox all day are emails from Democratic members of [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3900.5600000000004s)]
*  Congress. They're fundraising solicitations. And one yesterday caught my eye. It was AOC, who, [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3906.72s)]
*  while her politics aren't necessarily mine, I think she is a very authentic, terrific political [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3913.2s)]
*  athlete, just from a pure practitioner standpoint. And she said, a recap of the things that Trump has [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3919.12s)]
*  done to basically make the country worse in her opinion. Number one was J6. Number two was pulling [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3925.3599999999997s)]
*  out of the Paris climate deal. I found it fascinating because what you don't hear in her [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3931.36s)]
*  email and what you don't hear from Democrats is defending DEI policies in, let's say, the military. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3939.52s)]
*  You don't hear people criticizing the deportation of illegal immigrants who are criminals, right? [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3945.6800000000003s)]
*  You don't hear defending the COVID policies from years ago. The party doesn't know where to stand [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3952.56s)]
*  its ground and really even what it stands for on these issues, right? Immigration splitting the [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3959.84s)]
*  party basically in not just half, but like fourths. And so I think, you know, with Iron Dome or, [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3964.8s)]
*  you know, getting rid of the income tax, there's so much out there. And I think this was part of [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3972.8s)]
*  their strategy that Democrats right now in my lifetime, I've never seen us so quiet and so [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3977.6000000000004s)]
*  unsure of not just who should speak, but what he or she would say. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3983.84s)]
*  Yeah. They seem rudderless, Dan. Like, who's the leader? You know, who's the spokesperson for the [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3987.92s)]
*  Democrats these days? Dan. Yeah. Yeah. It's Dan. They should be so smart as to get you. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=3994.4s)]
*  It's to be determined here, you know, who will step forward for us. I mean, look, it really is an issue [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4002.56s)]
*  because, you know, I'm not the biggest fan of Kamala Harris as a candidate. She's quiet, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4008.16s)]
*  right? Is she living in New York or, you know, California? Is she running for governor? [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4014.3999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden's obviously gone. The Obamas and Clintons, it's not their thing. Nancy Pelosi appears [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4018.64s)]
*  this time around to have stepped even further back, you know, than she was even just a few years ago [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4024.48s)]
*  when Hakeem Jeffries took over. And look, we all know here Chuck Schumer's, what do they say, [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4030.3199999999997s)]
*  the most dangerous place is usually between him and a microphone and he doesn't seem to want to [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4036.16s)]
*  touch it. You know, even today, ICE in the Bronx, in his state, in his city, deporting illegals who [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4040.08s)]
*  have committed crimes. To my knowledge, I haven't looked in the last hour, he's silent, right? [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4047.04s)]
*  Kirsten Gillibrand, silent. She's the head of the DSCC this cycle. So I don't know who our [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4052.7999999999997s)]
*  spokesperson is right now, but I do believe people will emerge in the near future. Well, [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4058.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm concerned for you that it might be Joy Reid. I regret to inform you, it might be Joy Reid. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4065.04s)]
*  It's an unfortunate development for you normal Democrats. You should not allow this ascent. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4072.72s)]
*  Tom Homan was our guest the first half hour and he mentioned this nutcase who was out there last [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4078.72s)]
*  night comparing the Republicans and the immigration sweep to the Nazis and the Holocaust. Do we have [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4083.2s)]
*  that you guys? Let's watch. Defeating the Jews of Europe who they viewed as subhuman was a question [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4089.68s)]
*  of good conquering evil, which conditioned millions of Germans to celebrate Hitler and turn a blind eye [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4096.16s)]
*  to his brutality. If that sounds vaguely familiar, that's because it is. Similar similarities to what [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4102.24s)]
*  happened in Germany and what's happening now in America are just undeniable. History may not repeat [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4108.4s)]
*  verbatim, but it sure does rhyme. Trump and Stephen Miller, his former director of speech writing, [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4114.56s)]
*  depict non-white immigrants as carriers of deadly diseases who are violent terrorists. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4120.88s)]
*  Trump was returned to the presidency after staging a coup and has exerted control of media or social [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4126.4800000000005s)]
*  media in order to parrot anti-immigrant vitriol and openly hateful anti-LGBTQ language. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4132.400000000001s)]
*  And she finished that whole diatribe mark by accusing Elon of doing a Nazi salute at the Trump [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4138.48s)]
*  rally, which we've been over ad nauseam. Obviously she doesn't have a lot of sway with Democrats, [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4149.679999999999s)]
*  but is it shocking to you that she still has the post she does on MSNBC? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4157.12s)]
*  No, I mean, there's a niche audience for that line of discussion. I won't say any reasoning. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4161.280000000001s)]
*  It's not as big an issue as it was, although their numbers are up a little bit. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4169.76s)]
*  There, you know, it's interesting on the Republican side, on the MAGA side, people like her, [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4174.4800000000005s)]
*  people who create content, people have shows, they're interacting with the officials and [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4180.0s)]
*  they're being really tactical and strategic to say, what are we for that's popular and how do [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4186.400000000001s)]
*  we sell that to the public? The Democratic Party, which remains as far left as it's been in our [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4191.4400000000005s)]
*  lifetimes, isn't doing that. They're just out there selling what they've been selling to their [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4197.04s)]
*  audience, not trying to think, what's wrong with what we're selling? Why isn't it more appealing [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4202.64s)]
*  to a broader group? And her revenue model is apparently wedded to that line as opposed to [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4208.88s)]
*  trying to think in it. You've got CNN not doing much better. They have Scott Jennings on there, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4214.96s)]
*  as you've surely seen, Dan, and he's doing Yeoman's work trying to defend the Trump [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4221.84s)]
*  administration. He's literally the one Republican they put on with a panel of all Democrats. I [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4226.4800000000005s)]
*  include the anchors in that. And he got into a dust up last night with this woman from The Washington [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4231.76s)]
*  Post named Catherine Rampell, who used to be the theater critic, I think over at the Times. So this [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4237.52s)]
*  has enabled her to opine on whether, for example, Pete Hegseth is qualified to run the Department of [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4243.76s)]
*  Defense, saying his only real qualification is he was on Fox News, kind of just wiping out all that [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4249.52s)]
*  time he spent with a gun in Iraq and Afghanistan and at Gitmo. She's reduced him to a Fox TV host [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4254.88s)]
*  as though Trump had nominated Brian Kilmeade. She's back at it over there and she decides to go after [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4262.88s)]
*  Musk, who honestly, find me a billionaire, even Bill Ackman, who's constantly posting on X about [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4271.52s)]
*  10-7 and what's been happening at universities and is probably the main reason Claudine Gay went down [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4280.240000000001s)]
*  at Harvard. Find me a billionaire that's done more to call attention to what's happened to the Jewish [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4285.92s)]
*  people in Israel than Elon Musk. He went over there, he toured it with Ben Shapiro, he's been [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4292.160000000001s)]
*  wearing a necklace to represent the hostages since a parent of a hostage gave it to him. He said he [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4297.36s)]
*  won't take it off until they're all home. He's made repeated public statements about it. He went to [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4302.24s)]
*  Auschwitz. He recirculates their movies, like calling attention to this. He's a Nazi because he [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4306.24s)]
*  did the touch the heart and then the alleged salute thing and watch this exchange she had [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4312.4s)]
*  with Scott Jennings. The first time that Elon Musk decides to declare that globalist Jews are [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4317.36s)]
*  responsible for the great replacement of brown people into the United States, maybe it was a [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4326.24s)]
*  misunderstanding. You know, the second time he said that Jews are pushing hatred against white [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4331.5199999999995s)]
*  people, that's a quote. You know, that was a little iffy. By the second Sieg Heil, I think he kind of [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4337.2s)]
*  loses the benefit of the doubt to be not accused of playing footsie with these Nazis. He has a long [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4344.0s)]
*  record of supporting the Jewish people, number one. Number two, anybody who is asserting [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4351.36s)]
*  this thing he did on the stage the other day was a Sieg Heil, which I just heard you say, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4356.639999999999s)]
*  you know, lawyer up maybe because absolute ridiculous thing to say under no circumstances. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4361.5199999999995s)]
*  The Nazis in Germany thought it was a Sieg Heil. Under no circumstances was he doing anything other [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4367.36s)]
*  than expressing enthusiastically his appreciation to the crowd. Why don't you do it on TV right now [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4372.799999999999s)]
*  if you think it's so. Number three. I like I can't. I just tell you a little backstory about [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4378.0s)]
*  this woman. So she attacked Pete in the way I said I came on the air and pointed out she's a [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4388.32s)]
*  theater critic and she should shut up. She doesn't know anything. And then she posted on X she was [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4393.28s)]
*  all offended because people were writing nasty things to her. Oh, thanks a lot, Megan Kelly. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4398.8s)]
*  Let me explain something to you, Catherine, about being in the public eye. If you're going to go on [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4404.32s)]
*  CNN and you're going to offer inane opinions, people are going to comment on them and then you [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4407.84s)]
*  might get some nasty tweets. It's called being an adult on the internet. Grow up. So she doubles [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4412.08s)]
*  down and accuses Elon Musk of a double Sieg Heil. And why is this happening, Dan? Is it because they [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4417.84s)]
*  need to take down Elon? He's too much of a threat or is it because identity politics and the [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4423.360000000001s)]
*  opportunity to hit somebody for being anti Jew or anti black or anti what have you is so important [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4428.0s)]
*  to these far left wingers that they just look around for any possible opportunity and then they [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4434.16s)]
*  they seize on it. You know, they just see it where it isn't there because they train their brains [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4438.4s)]
*  that there are racists and Nazis everywhere among us. Yeah, that clip was embarrassing and ridiculous. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4442.32s)]
*  And I think, look, the frustrating thing as a Democrat is one, there is some data that the [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4449.76s)]
*  country is not comfortable with, like their business titans in government because they don't [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4456.96s)]
*  necessarily think they're there because they're completely patriotic and philanthropic. They think [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4462.8s)]
*  there might be in there to pad the bottom line and it's in their business interests. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4468.320000000001s)]
*  You lose all credibility to start making those arguments or people won't hear them when you [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4474.64s)]
*  start calling them a Nazi and you start kind of focusing on a hand gesture on the stage. [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4479.92s)]
*  Now, if he did it every time he spoke and he ended every meeting like that, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4487.12s)]
*  okay, different conversation. But as Scott said, to no one's knowledge, is he a Nazi or espouse, [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4492.16s)]
*  you know, hate the Jewish people or he's a racist. He's a Nazi. He's very bad at it. This is not how [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4498.96s)]
*  it's done, Elon. You do not express love for the Jewish people. You do not lament their hostage [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4505.68s)]
*  taking. You do not go pay homage at Auschwitz to those killed in the Holocaust. It's not a thing [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4510.32s)]
*  that you're doing it all wrong. It's crazy. And I just, again, the party doesn't know where to go. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4515.52s)]
*  I guess it's like trying to develop new muscles in your body. The old muscles sometimes kick in [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4522.320000000001s)]
*  early on and it's calling somebody a Nazi or doesn't support democracy has been kind of in [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4527.200000000001s)]
*  vogue, sadly, in my opinion, in the last four or five months in the party. So I just, it's maddening [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4534.160000000001s)]
*  because again, there is and it is fundamentally American, we're somewhat distrustful of powerful [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4541.28s)]
*  people. I think that has served our country well. And so, you know, I happen to believe that Elon [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4547.679999999999s)]
*  Musk probably as he pokes around the government is keeping an eye on one of his five businesses [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4552.88s)]
*  and thinking like, is there opportunities here? And so, you know, that is probably a better line [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4557.599999999999s)]
*  of questioning. And you might have to hold your powder dry until there's, you know, some good [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4562.5599999999995s)]
*  examples. But yes, that's it's embarrassing. Megan, I have a high. Yeah, go ahead. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4566.24s)]
*  I have a very high tolerance for crocodile tears because I've watched them shed by both parties [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4573.76s)]
*  throughout my career. But I thought back at after this, this made up controversy over Elon Musk's [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4578.08s)]
*  exuberant physical action, which you can find pictures of many Democrats doing to the controversy [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4585.12s)]
*  over the joke told about Puerto Rico at the Madison Square Garden rally. And for five days, [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4593.12s)]
*  for five days, the Democrats told us in the media that this was going to cost Donald Trump the [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4598.96s)]
*  election. And it's hard to imagine. I can't look into the soul of others. It's hard to imagine that [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4603.2s)]
*  there was really any Democrat actually outraged by the joke. These are crocodile tears. And, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4609.36s)]
*  and, and they're dangerous for a party trying to rebuild itself because if they think that the way [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4615.04s)]
*  to identify with the real lives of real people is to accuse Elon Musk of being kind of the Maxwell [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4620.4s)]
*  smart of Nazis, like so bumbling that he that he's doing a version of their salute in front of people. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4626.96s)]
*  I just I just find it really unfortunate. And again, it's testament to, as Dan said, their [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4634.4s)]
*  reflexes are to to criticize Donald Trump and everyone around him in personal terms, there are [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4639.92s)]
*  things to criticize, but to make up an accusation like this, it's very strange and, and, and [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4645.6s)]
*  unfortunate, but it's hard for the force. Yeah, this is why, like in a courtroom, you have to be [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4651.280000000001s)]
*  very careful because once you lose your credibility with a judge or the jury, you're toast. You cannot [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4656.320000000001s)]
*  get it back, which is why you don't over promise and under deliver. You don't make big accusations [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4661.6s)]
*  that you cannot support because then they don't trust you anymore. And they don't, they stop [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4667.280000000001s)]
*  listening to you on the critical things that you actually could potentially deliver on for your [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4671.84s)]
*  client. So you just, you never do it and they do it. It's like their favorite trick over on the left. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4675.76s)]
*  I do want to ask you a question about Elon, two things in the news about him today. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4680.56s)]
*  This one hit yesterday that Susie Wiles, Trump's chief of staff kept him out of the West wing that [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4684.56s)]
*  he reportedly or his team, and he wanted an office in the West wing for Doge. And she [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4690.56s)]
*  relegated them to the executive office building Doge entirely and Elon as well. So he's not going to [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4697.28s)]
*  be in the West wing suggesting she, she's going to rule with an iron fist. This wasn't about Elon, [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4704.16s)]
*  but she's on record as saying if I don't want any stars, you know, I don't want anybody sort [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4708.96s)]
*  of standouts. President Trump is the star. Like everybody here is in a supporting role and we work [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4713.679999999999s)]
*  together to advance his agenda. So what does that tell you if anything? [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4718.16s)]
*  Well, the real estate in the West wing is pretty rare, right? And there's logical arguments to keep [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4722.72s)]
*  all of Doge across the street for people who don't know the geography. It's not like he's in [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4731.280000000001s)]
*  Siberia. It's you walk across West executive Avenue and you're right there steps away from the [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4735.6s)]
*  oval. So I don't know that this will make that big a difference in how often he's with Donald [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4740.320000000001s)]
*  Trump and what his influences. And I don't know for a fact that Susie Wiles did this simply for [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4745.4400000000005s)]
*  the rational, you know, allotment of office space or she's trying to keep them apart. But Susie [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4750.64s)]
*  Wiles understands Donald Trump pretty well. And my guess is that if Donald Trump wants to be with [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4756.4800000000005s)]
*  Elon Musk, you know, in person and face to face, then not only would Susie Wiles not try to do it [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4762.08s)]
*  to try to stop it. I think she'd know she couldn't. Yeah. I mean, you've got, you mentioned his five [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4768.240000000001s)]
*  companies, Dan. It's like you forget that not only does he own X, but he's got, yeah, SpaceX, [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4773.52s)]
*  that whole thing that's better than NASA. Now he's got the boring company where he's boring [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4778.08s)]
*  through the ground right now with high speed train work. He's got Neuralink, which could [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4782.96s)]
*  potentially solve paralysis one day. It's already there inserting a chip into somebody's brain. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4788.64s)]
*  They've already done it to allow your brain, just your brain only to control like a computer [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4793.6s)]
*  pad in front of you, just with your thoughts. And it's working. That's just step one. Think of where [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4798.32s)]
*  they'll be 20 years from now. Then there's Tesla. I mean, it's insane the number of things he has [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4802.48s)]
*  going on. It's truly like roaming the earth at the same time as an Albert Einstein or, you know, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4808.719999999999s)]
*  Howard Hughes, one of these larger than life characters who will be remembered for generations. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4814.48s)]
*  And just like Trump, he will be, his name will be a household name for generations to come. So my [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4818.959999999999s)]
*  own feeling is if he wants access to just keep him happy. Why he, the fact that he wants to serve in [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4824.32s)]
*  any capacity is such a boon. And I don't, I think the only thing he wants for his companies is less [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4831.36s)]
*  red tape. He's just been so clear about the red tape hassles. But wait, one more question while [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4836.08s)]
*  we're on the subject of Elon. Vivek resurfaced last night after getting pushed out of Doge [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4841.679999999999s)]
*  and tried to tell Jesse Waters he was not pushed out of Doge. Listen. People are saying you didn't [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4847.679999999999s)]
*  get along with Musk. What happened there? I think that's incorrect. But what I would say is we had [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4853.92s)]
*  different and complimentary approaches. I focused more on a constitutional law, [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4858.56s)]
*  legislative based approach. It focused more on a technology approach, which is the future approach. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4862.4800000000005s)]
*  No better person to lead that technology digital approach than Elon Musk. But when you're talking [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4867.200000000001s)]
*  about a constitutional revival, it's not just done through the federal government. It's done through [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4871.84s)]
*  federalism where states also lead the way. So I'll have to be saying more on that very shortly, [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4875.84s)]
*  Jesse. All right. So Elon didn't fire you. It's no, we had a mutual discussion. And I think that I [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4880.88s)]
*  wish him well. We're on the same page where divide and conquer in saving the country. It's not a one [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4885.2s)]
*  man show from the top down or the bottom up. It's all of the above. And that's what I'm in for. [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4889.92s)]
*  Okay. Well, I just, listen, I've got to be honest. That did not strike me as as truthful at all. My [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4895.679999999999s)]
*  audience knows I do my Phil Houston spy the lie analysis on everybody, Republican and Democrat. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4901.12s)]
*  And so is it true you didn't get along? I think that's incorrect. That is not what truth sounds [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4906.16s)]
*  like. If they say, Megan, do you get along with Mark and Dan? I say, yeah, we get along great. I [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4911.52s)]
*  really like those guys. You say, Megan, do you get along with Bill O'Reilly? I say, well, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4916.56s)]
*  didn't end well. Right? Like it's come on. I think that's incorrect suggests it's true that [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4922.88s)]
*  they didn't they didn't get along. And then the I was working on a constitutional revival. What is [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4928.240000000001s)]
*  that? They were working on Doge. The whole thing is Department of Governmental Efficiency. They were [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4933.76s)]
*  trying to slash prices or efficiency, find efficiency so they could slash costs. Yes, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4937.36s)]
*  Vivek has written about, you know, constitutional revival. And he's written a lot of interesting [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4942.5599999999995s)]
*  things about it. But that that was not the mission at Doge. And lastly, so he didn't fire you know, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4946.719999999999s)]
*  it was a mutual discussion. And that's, that's contrary to the reporting and also doesn't sound [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4952.16s)]
*  like a truth teller. I just got to be honest. That's, that's my take on it. But have you guys [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4957.36s)]
*  done any reporting on this? And you definitely have sources in and around these two, I'm sure. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4961.6s)]
*  So what do you what do you know? Anyone? Well, the partnership was always a little bit odd to [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4967.4400000000005s)]
*  begin with, right? Two really strong willed guys, two guys used to being kind of in charge, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4973.52s)]
*  who knew each other some but not like best friends put in charge of a complicated program, [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4978.64s)]
*  high visibility program. So just the way it was set up originally seemed like it was a recipe [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4984.320000000001s)]
*  for disaster. And then, you know, there were some high profile things, particularly over the [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4990.24s)]
*  skilled worker visas, where I think it was less the cause of the breakup, but gave the must side [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=4996.0s)]
*  the capacity to say, this, this isn't going to work out. He does have a very soft landing, he can [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5003.92s)]
*  run go for run for be run to be governor of Ohio, probably with Donald Trump's endorsements. And [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5010.08s)]
*  he wants to be president. He's a lot better off doing that than where he was. So I think in the [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5015.679999999999s)]
*  end, everybody, everybody gets what they want. It's a little bit embarrassing for him. And Megan, [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5020.639999999999s)]
*  I will endorse your high human intelligence reading the reading the room on that guy's face. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5025.04s)]
*  No need for a lie detector strapped to his forehead. You can just watch and listen. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5030.96s)]
*  Yeah, I think it's better. I honestly think it's better than for somebody in the vakes position [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5035.599999999999s)]
*  there to say, Yeah, we didn't work out in the end. I love Ilan. But you know, we have two big [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5039.5199999999995s)]
*  personalities, he was running herd on it. I did a different view. And that's fine. We're all in [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5044.32s)]
*  great hands. I think it's better to just be honest, because I think people know. But yes, he's going [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5048.0s)]
*  to go run for governor of Ohio. And how do you like his chances there? Right now they've got [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5052.799999999999s)]
*  Governor Mike DeWine, who is not a MAGA type at all. Ohio has only gotten redder. So how do you [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5056.88s)]
*  like his chances there? And what do you think about the Missouri Democrat senator saying he's [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5063.759999999999s)]
*  not going to run for reelection. So it's an open seat now that happened to Michigan, Michigan, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5069.759999999999s)]
*  Michigan, sorry, Michigan, Michigan. Yeah. I mean, look, I think that the fact probably also would [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5074.799999999999s)]
*  love a Tesla factory in Ohio, once he becomes governor, not nothing like some delivering a [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5079.28s)]
*  few jobs. Once you get elected, if he is, I you know, the prospects for the Democratic Party in [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5085.28s)]
*  Ohio are pretty bleak, perhaps Sherrod Brown, who was probably the who is the most popular Democrat, [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5090.719999999999s)]
*  but still lost here, this last time around would think about running for governor. I know he's also [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5097.44s)]
*  thinking about running for the Senate seat here because there will be an election coming up here [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5102.88s)]
*  in twenty twenty six. And in Michigan, look, count me as someone who was stunned. Gary Peters [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5108.08s)]
*  stepped down. He just has been voting for some of Trump's nominees. He's been aggressive, [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5114.72s)]
*  raising money. He's been aggressive on television, kind of trying to straddle the line of his state, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5120.08s)]
*  which were things you would do if you were getting ready to run for reelection. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5125.76s)]
*  So I think this is going to be an interesting battle, because if you're Trump, this is a chance [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5129.76s)]
*  to get a statewide office holder in that state, perhaps put one of your own and obviously pick up [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5134.8s)]
*  a Senate seat. And if you're a Democrat, you know what this Mayor Pete do. He was rumored to be [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5140.16s)]
*  thinking of running for governor. Might he run for the Senate? And there are some talented young [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5146.56s)]
*  House members that will think about it. And I think this is a little bit of a fork in the road [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5151.04s)]
*  for the Democratic Party in Michigan. It's fascinating. Trump won Michigan and it's but [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5155.84s)]
*  it's not red. It's not Ohio. So the Republicans have got to be eyeballing that seat as like it'd [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5161.4400000000005s)]
*  be great to not have to worry about that fourth vote. Fifty four is a lot better than 53. Mark, [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5166.88s)]
*  Dan, we'll stay on it as I know you will. It's a pleasure, my friends. Thanks for being here. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5172.72s)]
*  Good to see you, Megan. Thank you. OK, and we'll be right back with a few more stories that we [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5177.6s)]
*  have to bring to you today, including an update on this crazy Justin Baldoni thing. [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5182.32s)]
*  And why does Captain America hate America? Here's a story for you. A lady named Phyllis [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5186.0s)]
*  walked into a neighborhood pharmacy in Colonial, New Jersey and asked the pharmacist for an [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5191.92s)]
*  antioxidant cream for her wrinkles. The pharmacist said, I'll compound one for you. Come back tomorrow. [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5196.08s)]
*  Phyllis used the cream for three days, went to her derm appointment, and the doctor said it looked [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5201.76s)]
*  like she'd had work done. Phyllis told everybody about the pharmacy and the pharmacist who made [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5206.08s)]
*  the magical cream. And that is, believe it or not, how Genucel was born. Since then, [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5210.8s)]
*  Genucel has shipped millions of orders, yet they still have the same philosophy of antioxidants, [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5216.8s)]
*  same natural base and same chef in the kitchen. Celebrating 25 years, Genucel's offering the [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5222.24s)]

*  that we wanted to get to today, including an update on the Justin Baldoni dust up with Blake [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5256.64s)]
*  Lively. You know that Justin and his team promised to start releasing all of his correspondence with [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5262.64s)]
*  her. They're saying, we'll be an open book. This is not a nice person. And Justin bent over backwards [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5267.52s)]
*  to accommodate her many, many demands, which included, according to him, taking over the film, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5274.400000000001s)]
*  rewriting scenes, all of which is very irregular for the costar. That's what the producer does, [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5280.0s)]
*  maybe a director, certainly a writer, none of which she was. But they're saying she decided [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5285.04s)]
*  she wanted to take over and use the power of her fame and name and that of her husband, Ryan [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5290.16s)]
*  Reynolds, to bully Justin Baldoni into the fetal position. And this has been released now, according [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5295.76s)]
*  to TMZ, they're sourcing Justin saying he's following through on his vow to release all his [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5302.4s)]
*  communications with Blake Lively, revealing a nearly seven minute apology he sent her at 2 AM [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5307.76s)]
*  while they were working on the film, It Ends With Us. The audience may recall this all got started [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5313.599999999999s)]
*  because she came out in the New York Times alleging that she'd been sexually harassed by [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5318.4s)]
*  him and that he, to keep it secret, generated an inorganic Blake sucks media campaign against her [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5323.12s)]
*  last summer when the movie was released. It had people like the New York Times and others saying, [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5331.28s)]
*  gee, we have to rethink all the bad press that we read or wrote about Blake Lively, were we used [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5335.599999999999s)]
*  by a sexual harasser trying to smear her. And this led Justin to eventually speak out saying, [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5342.48s)]
*  this is all BS that I didn't harass her in any way, shape or form. She tried to steal my movie [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5348.959999999999s)]
*  from her. I bent over backward to accommodate her. Her alleged claims of sexual harassment are [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5355.12s)]
*  complete BS. Here's what really happened. Released their actual texts, putting things like, [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5359.759999999999s)]
*  he watched me breastfeed naked in my trailer in context when we saw a text from her saying, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5365.5199999999995s)]
*  I'm breastfeeding in my trailer, come on over. And they've gone tit for tat in the, [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5370.16s)]
*  nice pun right after the breastfeeding, ever since in the media. So this is just the latest [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5374.96s)]
*  salvo. And I will play you a two minute summary of the seven minute groveling apology he sent her [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5379.36s)]
*  in this voicemail at 2 a.m. It's interesting by the way he has it. I guess he was taping his own [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5387.04s)]
*  voicemails because this is according to TMZ coming from him or his team, not from her. I think the [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5392.639999999999s)]
*  point of it is to show us that he was not some evil harasser. He was subjugated to her and Ryan [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5398.96s)]
*  Reynolds and clearly afraid of both of them. This guy's been to a little, if you too many, [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5406.72s)]
*  how to be a feminist classes. Take a listen. Hey Blake, it is two in the morning. Hopefully [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5412.4s)]
*  this does not wake you up. I want to start with an apology. Man, I, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5422.5599999999995s)]
*  reading the second part of your message, my heart sank. And I'm really sorry. I for sure fell short [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5430.959999999999s)]
*  and you worked really hard on that and the way you framed it and how that made you feel. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5442.48s)]
*  And I just want to say thank you for sharing that with me. That takes a lot of trust and [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5451.52s)]
*  vulnerability and damn right you got great friends if that's how you felt and they knew that and [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5458.080000000001s)]
*  we should all have friends like that. Aside from the fact we think that's Taylor Swift, [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5466.96s)]
*  though we don't know for sure. The three of you guys together, it's unbelievable. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5471.360000000001s)]
*  Talk about energy and just to force all three of you. But I just wanted you to know that I [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5476.0s)]
*  didn't need that because it's really good and it's going to make the movie sing like you said and [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5482.16s)]
*  and I'm excited to go through the whole movie with you. I'm just excited to spend time with you. I'm [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5488.0s)]
*  excited to be in your sphere and your presence and for us to share creative juices together. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5492.8s)]
*  That sounds terrible. You know I think you and I have been trying to build a relationship [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5501.76s)]
*  which I think we've done successfully. I mean here we are talking like this, me into my phone [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5509.52s)]
*  at two in the morning but there's nothing more exciting to me. Like that I get to work with [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5515.360000000001s)]
*  Blake Lively and have her, all of her. Anyways I have so much more to say. I'm going to stop [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5520.4800000000005s)]
*  rambling because Jesus Christ it's been six minutes and 30 seconds so f*** me. I'm sorry. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5524.4800000000005s)]
*  You probably have kids all over you and a baby on your boob and you're listening to me ramble at [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5531.68s)]
*  two in the morning. He's an odd man. This is an odd odd man. I can't imagine receiving a seven [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5535.92s)]
*  minute. I guess it was a voice memo that he wrote. He did on his own phone center. Why? Nobody wants [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5542.080000000001s)]
*  a seven minute voice memo or voicemail from anybody. Even just a call seems aggressive in [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5546.400000000001s)]
*  2025 doesn't it? When somebody calls you it seems aggressive. But never mind a seven minute. So [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5551.6s)]
*  there's speculation that this may be what one of the things because it sounds like they'd already [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5557.52s)]
*  had their fight that night where Ryan Reynolds reamed him out. But you know you tell me whether [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5562.320000000001s)]
*  your husband wants a man calling you at two in the morning and whether there was something between [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5567.040000000001s)]
*  these two that got Ryan Reynolds back up. You know that made him a little concerned that had her [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5571.76s)]
*  running to the harassment. I swear it was harassment place. It's one of the theories that's out there. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5577.52s)]
*  What I hear is an emasculated man who is probably not a harasser but is a bootlicker [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5582.64s)]
*  begging for his star to treat him well and let him participate in his whole movie which doesn't [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5589.52s)]
*  exactly make Justin look great but it certainly doesn't support her narrative that he was this [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5596.72s)]
*  evil, brutal, bully, sexual harasser and poor little meek, powerless Blake just had to deal with [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5601.76s)]
*  his aggressive advances. That's just so obviously a lie at this point. Like I don't know. She's made [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5607.6s)]
*  herself into Amber Heard. We all see it. This was a massive disaster for her to unleash this PR [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5613.84s)]
*  campaign against him which by the way Brian Friedman told us she started. She was the one [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5619.84s)]
*  through her PR agent who was dropping negative stories about Justin. Not the other way around. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5624.72s)]
*  She played with fire and now she got burned. This isn't going to end well for you Blake. Sorry. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5630.240000000001s)]
*  By the way, his book in 2021 was called Man Enough, Undefining My Masculinity and he did a whole podcast [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5636.16s)]
*  trying to undefine his masculinity. Justin, you succeeded. You're good. You can stop unspooling [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5643.599999999999s)]
*  now because there's no thread left on that thing. Okay. Captain America. There's an actor who's [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5650.799999999999s)]
*  playing Captain America and his name is Anthony Mackey and he decided to do a promotional event [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5658.639999999999s)]
*  Monday in Roma and here is what he said. For me, Captain America represents a lot of different [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5664.48s)]
*  things and I don't think the term, you know, America should be one of those representations. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5671.839999999999s)]
*  Like it's about a man who keeps his word, who has honor, dignity, and integrity. Someone who is [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5678.5599999999995s)]
*  trustworthy and dependable. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5687.68s)]
*  Honestly, it's like they want us to hate these Hollywood stars, you know, like Snow White. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5692.0s)]
*  Well, she's not going to be rescued by a prince. I can tell you that. [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5697.76s)]
*  And now this guy, Captain America, I can tell you what Captain America is not about America. [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5701.84s)]
*  Hello, you complete fool. It's in the name. There's like two things Captain America is about. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5706.160000000001s)]
*  It's being a captain of America for America. It's written right in there. They idiot-proofed [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5713.04s)]
*  it, my friend. You don't even have to try hard. No, it's about being dignified. Oh, because that's [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5719.6s)]
*  not American, you see. Why do they keep casting these people in these iconic American roles who [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5725.12s)]
*  hate the country? This is why the right half of the country hates you, Holly Weird and Disney [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5730.32s)]
*  and the people who put together these films. I'm sick of this nonsense. So put another one on your [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5736.24s)]
*  list. Not to see comes out in two weeks. Captain America, who appears to hate the country? [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5740.24s)]
*  Okay. Last but not least, New York Magazine, you won't be surprised, has done a hit piece [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5747.04s)]
*  on conservatives, but this one is so interesting because it's totally backfired on them. They [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5751.76s)]
*  put out, let me just walk you through it. Okay. So they first, they put out this cover of New York [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5759.44s)]
*  Magazine and it shows an event at inauguration weekend. I think that was put together by CJ [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5763.44s)]
*  Pearson, who not for nothing is a young black conservative. And the headline for the listening [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5770.16s)]
*  audience is the cruel kids table, the cruel kids table for New York Magazine. And what you see on [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5775.839999999999s)]
*  the front is a collection of absolutely beautiful, happy, seemingly optimistic world at our fingertips [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5782.48s)]
*  twenties and thirties folks celebrating Trump's win and the promise that it brings for what again, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5793.5199999999995s)]
*  America, that's for you captain. And what we got from New York Magazine was a smear piece [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5800.719999999999s)]
*  that tried to tell us they're racists and cropped the picture to eliminate the black participants. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5806.5599999999995s)]
*  So look at the larger picture, the larger spread that appeared inside the magazine, but not on the [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5814.799999999999s)]
*  cover where you can see on screen left, there are one, two, three, at least four black men who have [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5820.32s)]
*  been cropped out of the picture. It's really shocking. I mean, I guess it's not that shocking, [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5829.2s)]
*  but it's an obvious hit piece on MAGA and what they've actually wound up doing. And I do mean [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5836.799999999999s)]
*  they, because the person who wrote this uses the pronoun they, I'm sorry, but they has taken [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5842.799999999999s)]
*  Brock Collier. They is not available to you. I think Brock is a he going by they. I refuse. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5848.4s)]
*  I'm going to call you he. Brock thinks he has it all figured out. And then I guess if he just puts [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5854.879999999999s)]
*  a bunch of beautiful white people on the cover of New York Magazine, it's going to make us hate MAGA. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5860.96s)]
*  What I think is going to happen is young, bitter, shaved head leftists with their little blue [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5865.839999999999s)]
*  bracelets and their huge glasses are going to look at these youthful, gorgeous, glowing, [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fb7WJNGRFcA&t=5872.64s)]
