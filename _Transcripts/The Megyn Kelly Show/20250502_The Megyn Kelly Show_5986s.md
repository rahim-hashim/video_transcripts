Video Description: Megyn Kelly premieres "Blonde Origin," trolling the "Blue Origin" space mission. Then she's joined by Maureen Callahan, Mark Halperin, and Link Lauren, the stars of MK Media, and her friend and hair stylist Sara Clemente, to discuss the premiere of “Blonde Origin”, their hilarious spoof of the ridiculous Blue Origin “astronauts,” the absurd behind-the-scenes details from the filming, and more. Then Mike Rowe, host of "People You Should Know," joins to discuss the challenging requirements for true space exploration, his experience with a fighter pilot, the absurd "Blue Origin" women pretending they accomplished something historic, Michelle Obama’s latest round of complaints about how expensive and difficult it was to live in the White House, how wildly out-of-touch her comments are given her elite status, the contrast between empowered individuals who find fulfillment in hard work and privileged elites who still feel dissatisfied, stories of perseverance highlighting the importance of gratitude and his new show, lighthearted stories of humility in unexpected moments, the importance of laughing at ourselves and mocking smug elites, and more.

# Michelle Obama's White House Complaints, "Blonde Origin" Premieres, w/ Mike Rowe and MK Media Hosts
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show and happy Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been a very busy week here at the show down in DC for my exclusive Tulsi Gabbard sit down on Wednesday. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4.0s)]
*  Then in New York City with Dave Portnoy for the full show yesterday. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=11.0s)]
*  So we have planned a little fun for you today to close out the week. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=14.0s)]
*  We're going to have Mike Rowe joining us in just a bit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=19.0s)]
*  But before we get to him, we are going to bring you the full Blonde Origin world premiere. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=21.0s)]
*  And then we will have on all the stars of the show right after including Maureen Callahan, Mark Halperin, Link Lauren, and my friend and hairstylist Sarah Clemente. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=29.0s)]
*  And you will see why she's involved before we play it for you. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=40.0s)]
*  I want to tell you we had so much fun doing this that we made it so that you can join in on the fun too. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=44.0s)]
*  You can go to we just created this shop, Megyn Kelly dot com and get some Blonde Origin merch. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=50.0s)]
*  There are hats. There are notebooks. There are mugs. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=56.0s)]
*  We are leaning in to this massive troll. Go to shop. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=59.0s)]
*  Megyn Kelly dot com right now. Join the Blonde Origin trolling fun. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=63.0s)]
*  Without further ado, the world premiere of Blonde Origin. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=67.0s)]
*  Please don't call it a ride when zero gravity left some with zero clue. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=73.0s)]
*  Take me up space. Have you been? Have you been? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=81.0s)]
*  Three women were brave enough to answer the call. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=88.0s)]
*  It's not a ride. It's a mission. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=92.0s)]
*  This is special coverage of Blonde Origin. Zero gravity, zero clue. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=95.0s)]
*  Here are your hosts, Mark Halperin and Link Lauren. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=103.0s)]
*  You're looking live not at Lambeau Field, but at LaGuardia Airport. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=109.0s)]
*  It is a beautiful day to make history, a beautiful day to defy gravity. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=113.0s)]
*  Link, welcome in to our coverage. Glad to have you here, your veteran of these space launches. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=118.0s)]
*  How do you see today? [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=122.0s)]
*  You know, Mark, it's great to be with you. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=123.0s)]
*  I just spoke to a source in Connecticut that said Megan's husband, Douglas Brunt, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=125.0s)]
*  just took out a massive life insurance policy on her this morning, but I'm sure that is not suspicious whatsoever. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=128.0s)]
*  What could possibly go wrong? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=134.0s)]
*  Link, I can't help but reflect on the great astronauts in American history, Buzz Aldrin, John Glenn. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=136.0s)]
*  Are our three heroes today likely to enter the pantheon of greatest ever? [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=141.0s)]
*  You know, I can't tell if Buzz Aldrin would be proud of these women or if he'd be trying to slip a Mickey in their drinks at the bar, [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=146.0s)]
*  but nonetheless, they are really opening doors, Mark. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=152.0s)]
*  Link, let's meet our three brave astronauts today, the crew made up of three first timers, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=155.0s)]
*  brave souls who are going where no one has gone before or very many people have gone before. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=161.0s)]
*  Megan Kelly, of course, she's a journalist, an attorney, political commentator, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=166.0s)]
*  and of course, a successful host on a program that appears on SiriusXM and on YouTube. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=170.0s)]
*  Joining Megan for this historic mission, Maureen Callahan, columnist for The Daily Mail, [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=175.0s)]
*  and the host of The Nerve podcast on the Megan Kelly Network. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=180.0s)]
*  And finally, Sarah Clemente. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=184.0s)]
*  Sarah Clemente. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=186.0s)]
*  She's a hairstylist, one of Megan's close friends, her number one priority today, Link, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=187.0s)]
*  making sure that everyone's hair looks absolutely flawless, even at zero G. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=192.0s)]
*  Absolutely, Mark. It doesn't really matter what you're doing as long as you look great doing it. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=198.0s)]
*  These women could be on the cover of Vogue tomorrow, and I hope they are for the scientific feat going up into zero gravity. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=203.0s)]
*  For some of these first time space travelers, Link, this would be as tough as Pete Davidson at a Kardashian family reunion. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=210.0s)]
*  What are the challenges they're facing today? [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=217.0s)]
*  Well, I think these women are going to prove once and for all that silicone, Botox, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=220.0s)]
*  Juvederm, hair extensions can survive in zero gravity. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=224.0s)]
*  This is a scientific feat, a scientific miracle. This is going to be the amazing one. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=228.0s)]
*  Okay, here we go. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=232.0s)]
*  The nation indeed, Link, the world is watching. What kind of pressure are these young women on? [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=234.0s)]
*  These women are under immense pressure. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=239.0s)]
*  They are up there with Buzz Aldrin and other space travelers who have paved the way for them before, Mark. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=241.0s)]
*  You know, Mark, what I think is going through these women's heads is that they are opening doors for women. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=247.0s)]
*  These three women are proving once and for all there's nothing a woman can't do that a man can, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=252.0s)]
*  as long as it's for a few minutes and they don't have to operate any heavy machinery. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=256.0s)]
*  These women have worked incredibly hard. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=260.0s)]
*  The athletic prowess of these three women is unmatched by anybody I've seen before, Mark. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=263.0s)]
*  Here they are at one of the great historic space sites in the world, LaGuardia Airport, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=269.0s)]
*  walking to what is their date with destiny. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=274.0s)]
*  On a scale of one to ten, these women are at an eleven right now, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=277.0s)]
*  and a wind tour from Vogue would be incredibly proud of these women. They look incredible, Mark. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=280.0s)]
*  Mission control says they're cleared for takeoff. This could not be more exciting. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=287.0s)]
*  We got this! [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=294.0s)]
*  Our crew is working in what's called a modified Boeing 727. It's G-Force One. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=297.0s)]
*  Great technology inside G-Force One. It uses special hydraulics, allows for maneuvers to achieve zero gravity. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=303.0s)]
*  Mark, I would never attempt this in my wildest dreams. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=310.0s)]
*  Now, like these three are comrades and colleagues, but they're also, they've got a competitive streak, let's be honest. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=313.0s)]
*  When you look at them, who's got the best as the space correspondent Lady Gaga would say, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=319.0s)]
*  P-P-P-P-P-Poker face? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=323.0s)]
*  I think Miss Megyn Kelly herself looks like she is really up to the challenge. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=326.0s)]
*  She's got her zipper down, she's got her stylish boots on, she's got her hair perfectly clothed. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=330.0s)]
*  I think Megyn Kelly is in it to win it today, Mark. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=335.0s)]
*  You ready for your ride? [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=338.0s)]
*  Please don't call it a ride. That's the sexiest thing to do. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=339.0s)]
*  When men are on board one of these crafts, one of these vessels, no one ever calls it a ride. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=343.0s)]
*  Tens of millions watching us live around the world and some of the more famous people in this country have gathered to experience history in the making. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=348.0s)]
*  And look, oh no, oh yes, Lady Oprah in the house. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=357.0s)]
*  You know, we can't tell if Oprah is crying tears of joy or if she's crying because she's not the center of attention for once. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=362.0s)]
*  Not clear why Oprah's weepy, but this is a dramatic and emotional moment I think for many of us. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=369.0s)]
*  And now let's watch as the women experience lunar gravity for the very first time. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=379.0s)]
*  It's getting quiet. Whoa! [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=386.0s)]
*  Whoa! Oh my God! [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=388.0s)]
*  Whoa! Whoa! [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=391.0s)]
*  Whoa! Whoa! [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=394.0s)]
*  Stand up! Stand up! [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=402.0s)]
*  Link, according to the Encyclopedia Britannica, or maybe I saw it on Twitter, most of the moon landings have been fake. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=408.0s)]
*  This, though, seems all too real. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=414.0s)]
*  Mark, this is absolutely 100% authentic. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=416.0s)]
*  Whoa! Are my eyelashes still on? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=420.0s)]
*  Is my silicone okay? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=423.0s)]
*  Is my Botox still between the eyes? Oh my. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=427.0s)]
*  Link, I never saw John Glenn fix his eyelashes. This is a new frontier, a final frontier, if you will. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=431.0s)]
*  Well, Mark, beauty is incredibly important, and these three women are proving that silicone, filler, Botox, fake eyelashes, hair extensions can survive and thrive in zero gravity. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=437.0s)]
*  Well, this is exciting. Now the women are about to experience true weightlessness for the very first time. Let's look. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=452.0s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=459.0s)]
*  Pushing over! [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=461.0s)]
*  Zero four! [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=463.0s)]
*  Whoa! Whoa! [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=465.0s)]
*  Whoa! Whoa! [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=468.0s)]
*  Oh my God! [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=470.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=472.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=474.0s)]
*  Yes! [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=476.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=478.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=480.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=482.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=484.0s)]
*  Back down! [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=486.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=488.0s)]
*  In spaces and sports, records are made to be broken. I'm told our heroes today have shattered the mark set by the gals from Blue Origin. Tell us what they've done. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=490.0s)]
*  Mark, these women have spent twice as much time in weightlessness than any of the women on that ridiculous 11-minute Blue Origin ride. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=500.0s)]
*  Back here on Earth, sails of Ozempic are plummeting because women have found a way to be weightless without any GLP-1 drugs, Mark. This is incredible. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=508.0s)]
*  It's happening. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=517.0s)]
*  Whoa! [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=519.0s)]
*  It's happening! [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=521.0s)]
*  Oh my God! [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=523.0s)]
*  Take you off space! [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=525.0s)]
*  It's not a ride. It's not a ride. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=527.0s)]
*  Link, like all the events in the world today, social media paying close attention to our heroes. Here's one tweet I'll read to you. This is from Rx4245. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=535.0s)]
*  Blue Origin, weightless. Blonde Origin, weightless. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=547.0s)]
*  We knew your expectations of us were high and we exceeded them. We exceeded them! [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=551.0s)]
*  It's the whole world. I'm like, it's the whole world. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=558.0s)]
*  Woohoo! [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=564.0s)]
*  It's Redwick! [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=566.0s)]
*  It's Redwick! [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=570.0s)]
*  Ready to get in position again? [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=574.0s)]
*  Megan Kelly going for the water. She's going, she's going. Oh, it's a miss! [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=576.0s)]
*  Let's see if she tries again. Yes! [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=580.0s)]
*  I'm inspirational! [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=584.0s)]
*  Megan Kelly, one for two. Link, that gets you in the Hall of Fame if you play for the New York Yankees. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=586.0s)]
*  Get her right there! [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=592.0s)]
*  Absolutely, Mark. And as Megan Kelly said herself, she is an inspiration catching that water in zero gravity. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=594.0s)]
*  Let's look at this again in slow motion. Megan Kelly, thirsty as all get out. You don't lose your taste for the drink, even in zero gravity. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=601.0s)]
*  And not only are these women thirsty for water, they're thirsty for fame, they're thirsty for attention, but in 2025, that is perfectly acceptable, Mark. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=610.0s)]
*  Welcome home, brave space angels. We knew you could do it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=618.0s)]
*  I still have difficulty calling myself an astronaut. I know, I know. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=624.0s)]
*  Here are heroes descending back. They're sun kissed and now, wait a minute. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=628.0s)]
*  Link, I've heard of kissing the ground under such circumstances, but this to me looks to be a full on makeout session. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=636.0s)]
*  You know, Mark, I think these women should buy the ground a drink first. I also know there are a lot of men who would be jealous of the ground right now. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=644.0s)]
*  This is a grand space tradition. NASA has done it for years. The names of our heroes turned right side up and upside down. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=651.0s)]
*  And now let's listen in for the first time back on Earth to our star heroes from space. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=658.0s)]
*  I think it's such a wonderful world. Should we sing a little bit? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=663.0s)]
*  I see shades of blue, trees of green. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=669.0s)]
*  And I think to myself, what a wonderful world. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=683.0s)]
*  Here is space's top talker, Megyn Kelly. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=691.0s)]
*  Did I mention how proud I am of me? [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=694.0s)]
*  You know, you tend to do that. I forgot for one second, but yes, yes you are. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=698.0s)]
*  Not just to girls and women, either. Boys too. Boys and men. They all find me very inspirational. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=702.0s)]
*  How was the ride? [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=709.0s)]
*  I don't appreciate when people call it a ride. It's not a ride. They never say that for the other astronauts. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=711.0s)]
*  It's a flight. It's a mission. Okay? There's nothing frivolous about what we just did. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=717.0s)]
*  Okay? It was a flight. It was a mission. And it was mission accomplished. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=723.0s)]
*  Well, a little bit of unhappiness there for Megyn. Maybe not getting the respect she thinks she and her crew deserve. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=729.0s)]
*  You know, Mark, how dare anybody call this a ride? This is a mission. These women were incredible. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=735.0s)]
*  This is a scientific feat. They trained. They worked hard. This is amazing, Mark. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=741.0s)]
*  You know, Mark, my producer is saying we've got Megyn on the line. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=747.0s)]
*  Yeah. Hi guys. It's MK. Look, I don't know what's happening here, but I don't hear us being called astronauts enough. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=750.0s)]
*  Or at all. You know, we did the same flight path as Alan Shepard. Astronauts. Astronauts. Okay? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=758.0s)]
*  I'd like to hear that a bit more, please. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=766.0s)]
*  Guys! Get it right there! [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=768.0s)]
*  Please focus on what matters. I would really appreciate it. I got to run. I have some more selfies to take. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=773.0s)]
*  But thanks so much for your coverage. Bye. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=779.0s)]
*  That was Megyn Kelly. Megyn, we understand your point of view. We reject it summarily, but we do understand. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=781.0s)]
*  Link, an incredible historic day. My mind wanders to times at the beach or going to Coney Island and winning a stuffy. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=789.0s)]
*  But tell me your reflections. What has this meant to you as someone who's covered space launches for, I don't know, 20 minutes? [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=797.0s)]
*  I am just overcome with emotion. I am incredibly proud of these three women for everything they went to and the lead up to the launch for surviving zero gravity and making it back down to Earth safe and sound. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=805.0s)]
*  This concludes our special coverage of Blonde Origin. Are you inspired yet? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=822.0s)]
*  And remember, it's not a ride, damn it. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=830.0s)]
*  That is not a friggin' ride. Whenever a man goes out, you have never said to an astronaut, boy, what a ride. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=835.0s)]
*  There was nothing frivolous about what we did. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=841.0s)]
*  Taking off space! [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=844.0s)]
*  We're at a mile time high, and so I want to tell you about Berna. That's B-Y-R-N-A. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=859.0s)]
*  Berna's less lethal launchers are equipped with tear gas and kinetic ammunition and designed to incapacitate an attacker for up to 40 minutes. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=864.0s)]
*  And Berna is excited to introduce the all new compact launcher. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=873.0s)]
*  It's sleek, slim, and hits like a sledgehammer, the same size as a smartphone, allowing women to conceal carry everywhere comfortably and with confidence. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=877.0s)]
*  It fires at 400 feet per second. That's a lot of power to stop aggressives in their tracks without having to deal with the complexities of a homicide. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=887.0s)]
*  Their pistols are American made and hand assembled in Fort Wayne, Indiana, with over 80% of the components in the compact launcher being sourced in the USA. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=895.0s)]
*  Berna is legal in all 50 states. It requires no background checks, and it can be shipped directly to your door. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=905.0s)]
*  And Berna is trusted by hundreds of police departments and government agencies worldwide. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=912.0s)]
*  Try before you buy. Visit Berna.com to find a Berna dealer partner near you. That's B-Y-R-N-A dot com. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=917.0s)]
*  And now joining me, the stars of the show here in studio with me, Sarah Clementi, plus the stars of MK Media, our new network, Maureen Callahan, Mark Halperin, and Link Lauren. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=925.0s)]
*  Guys, Mark and Maureen and Link, what a launch for your podcasts, both literally and figuratively. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=939.0s)]
*  Mark Halperin, I never knew you were so funny, but that was hysterical. Well done, you guys. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=946.0s)]
*  Thank you. I'm honored to participate and I just channeled Fred Willard from Best in Show. That was my inspiration. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=953.0s)]
*  100%. Exactly. So Maureen, I haven't gotten to see, I showed it to Sarah this morning as she was doing my hair, but that was your first view of it. What did you think? [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=960.0s)]
*  I literally have tears coming out of my, like I just, I had no idea what this was going to look like piece together. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=970.0s)]
*  I think that having Mark and Link as the brave journalists covering and quite frankly acknowledging exactly what we did, how we did it, how brave we are, not for nothing. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=979.0s)]
*  My updo stayed intact throughout 15 weightless parabolic arcs. I would like some recognition for that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=990.0s)]
*  I would like Gail King to summon us to like a little summit for the brave souls that we are. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=999.0s)]
*  And I just thank God for you too, Megan and Sarah, because frankly, I'm phasing people out of my life who have not been. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1006.0s)]
*  If you haven't been, you can't talk about it. And I really appreciate Link. You're recognizing the sacrifice that we were making and the risks from the silicone to the Botox to the Juvederm. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1012.0s)]
*  I mean, you knew exactly where to zero in on on the great scientific experiment that was that ride. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1024.0s)]
*  Well, absolutely. I also knew you guys were a little bit crazy, but you're the only people I know who would pay to go to LaGuardia willingly when you don't have to. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1030.0s)]
*  I don't know anybody who would just choose to go to LaGuardia on a Sunday morning unless they had to. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1039.0s)]
*  But yeah, silicone, Botox, filler, hair extensions. We can't have a hair emergency in space that'd be up there with the Challenger emergency. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1045.0s)]
*  We can't. We can't. Everything has to be. That's right. So we planned ahead and we brought Sarah, who was our Lauren Sanchez inspired character. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1052.0s)]
*  She's not normally running around showing off her breasts. I am not. This was more natural. Yeah, it was inspirational. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1059.0s)]
*  You're right. Exactly. It was inspired by very inspired by and a lot of videos. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1065.0s)]
*  Did you have any hesitation when I when I called you and said, would you like to go to space? How quickly did I answer? [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1070.0s)]
*  I mean, immediately. Yeah, I said I knew this was going to happen. Yes. Yeah. Are we going to die? No. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1075.0s)]
*  And Sarah not only was the hairstylist in space, but also the pharmacist. She gave me one of those Zofrans. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1081.0s)]
*  Is that right? Yeah. Oh, yeah. Because what we actually wrote is officially nicknamed the vomit comet. Yep. [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1087.0s)]
*  And that was the last thing we wanted to do. We didn't see any of the Blue Origin ladies throw up and we'd be damned if we were going to throw up. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1094.0s)]
*  So we took the Zofran and there was some nausea on my part. I mean, I had the we had a little bands. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1101.0s)]
*  I don't know what would have happened if we didn't. I shudder to think. Yeah. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1107.0s)]
*  Mark, I appreciate you referring to us properly as your brave space angels and astronauts. Let's not forget the astronauts, too. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1112.0s)]
*  And I also thought it was very wise of you to to point out how LaGuardia really is the new Cape Canaveral. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1120.0s)]
*  It is. People think of it as kind of a crappy place where it looks like you have to go. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1127.0s)]
*  But for me, it's like Fenway Park or Walt Disney World is one of the great American sites. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1132.0s)]
*  I do want to show the audience one of the things we know about the Blue Origin flight is that those ladies trained. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1140.0s)]
*  It was it was long, in-depth training as the commentators who were watching their launch pointed out. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1147.0s)]
*  And we have some video of our training as well that we wanted to show the audience. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1153.0s)]
*  Here's a little bit of it. Let's put it on the board. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1157.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's it. No, no, no. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1160.0s)]
*  There was buckling of seatbelts. This is not the training. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1164.0s)]
*  There was buckling of seatbelts. And you know what else there was? [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1167.0s)]
*  I mean, this is the true sacrifice. But Maury and Sarah and yours truly. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1171.0s)]
*  We were not allowed to drink the night before and the morning of. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1175.0s)]
*  Why don't you tell the people, Sarah, what we had to eat? [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1179.0s)]
*  Well, we had to eat a plain bagel, right? Not toasted. Right. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1182.0s)]
*  So it made that experience not as great as it should have been for us to eat a bagel. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1186.0s)]
*  But exactly. If we're going to do a link, Lauren, I mean, you of all people can appreciate we ate huge bready carbs for this thing. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1191.0s)]
*  I was going to say you guys had to eat carbs before going into space. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1198.0s)]
*  I'm just so happy I didn't have to go up there when your producer, Steve, called me and said, do you want to go to space with Megyn Kelly? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1202.0s)]
*  I was like, how do I get out of this? I am the biggest scary cat. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1208.0s)]
*  I drive under the speed limit. I lock my door three times a night. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1212.0s)]
*  I don't go home with strangers except on rare occasion. I did not want to go up there. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1216.0s)]
*  OK, I would have been scared for my life. I'm so happy you all got to go and have that experience without. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1220.0s)]
*  Well, I have to say, not only did Sarah say yes immediately, but poor Maureen, who's now been dragged into two of these things. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1225.0s)]
*  I mean, your acting career, Maureen, is off to with a bang. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1232.0s)]
*  I mean, I heard you reference it on your new show, The Nerve with Maureen Kelley. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1236.0s)]
*  But I mean, you're like in awards ceremony territory now. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1239.0s)]
*  Well, Megan, let's be fair. I mean, I'm hearing it for both of us. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1242.0s)]
*  You know, we're a two hander. We're a team. You know, Emmy off like I would I would like to be getting my SAG card imminently. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1246.0s)]
*  I think I deserve it. And, you know, now we've added astronaut to our resume. [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1253.0s)]
*  I mean, what can't we do? I ask you, what can't we do? [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1257.0s)]
*  The nothing's coming to mind. I mean, as Mark pointed out, did you see me get that second drop of water? [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1260.0s)]
*  I mean, like a professional, sir. I know, because I caught that drop of water in my eyeball. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1265.0s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I mean, I mean, no disrespect. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1271.0s)]
*  But I think the answer to what can't you do would be the G and E got based on the singing in the video. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1273.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, it was slightly off tune. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1279.0s)]
*  I'm just saying Grammy may be the last one you get. I'm not saying you'll never get it. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1284.0s)]
*  I don't think you guys will ever be winning any Oscars. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1288.0s)]
*  You're way too Caucasian. OK, if you are not. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1291.0s)]
*  You know, maybe exactly right. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1294.0s)]
*  A little parody. So white never never wins the award. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1297.0s)]
*  I have to say I huge shout out to our producer, Jake Whitman, who did both that and the Meghan Markle takeoff parody that we did, who is incredibly talented. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1301.0s)]
*  Put together those A.I. astronaut shots of us and got that flight. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1311.0s)]
*  You know, that is what our flight did. But I mean, like, I doubt somebody took actual video of our flight the night before that you were like, Jake's got to come. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1316.0s)]
*  Oh, so we knew that he was going to produce this whole segment. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1324.0s)]
*  But they had told us originally at zero gravity that we couldn't have a photo on board because he would get sick. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1327.0s)]
*  They basically say only people who are very used to going up and zero G can look through a lens and not barf. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1333.0s)]
*  And so they said no. And then Jake was like, well, they said you three can go up with them with Go Pro's. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1339.0s)]
*  And I was like, oh, geez, we'll never survive with those Go Pro's. [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1345.0s)]
*  We'll be wailing them all over each other. I'm like, if we can bring up a GoPro, then we can bring up Jake. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1348.0s)]
*  And so literally the night before, I'm like, do you want to come? [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1353.0s)]
*  And he, too, is brand new, you guys, to the MK media property. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1356.0s)]
*  And he was like, when do I show up? Welcome aboard. Mission accomplished. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1360.0s)]
*  We're all going into space together. I have to say, I think that this was an important moment for America. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1366.0s)]
*  I think this is the healing moment we needed, Maureen, in getting past the trauma of those morons two weeks ago. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1373.0s)]
*  I couldn't agree with you more. And I really, you know, to Mark's point that LaGuardia is now the equivalent of Cape Canaveral, [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1379.0s)]
*  I think a plaque should be placed on that tarmac. MK, me, Sarah, the contributions we have made to womankind and feminism. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1386.0s)]
*  And yeah, not for nothing. Like keeping your glam intact, going through 15 major parabolic arcs in which I personally slammed into the ceiling, into the walls, into the floor. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1396.0s)]
*  Like, yes, I defy a man to do it. I just I defy a man to do it. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1407.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. And Sarah, did you accomplish your mission of making sure your number one priority, as Mark put it, that everyone's hair looks absolutely flawless and surgery? [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1412.0s)]
*  As someone who's been skydiving. So I'm a professional skydiver and an astronaut. Yeah, all in one. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1421.0s)]
*  I was on I did not know if the if hair was going to be like how it is skydiving, which is not good. Not attractive. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1426.0s)]
*  It's the extensions are gone. All of it, you know, and myself, you know, the extensions would fly right out. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1433.0s)]
*  Anyway, I was taken aback by how good hair looks in zero gravity. It adds a plump. It adds volume. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1440.0s)]
*  It was floating. Maureen's hair stayed. It was incredible. There were no bobby pins flying out. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1449.0s)]
*  And I have to say kudos to you for choosing the ponytail for yours truly. Yeah. Oh, we forgot to put on our hats. Oh, yeah. Oh, we forgot our celebratory. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1454.0s)]
*  Oh, hold on. Wait. Hold on. Sell the merch. Sell the merch. I actually here's our hats. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1463.0s)]
*  But the the ponytail really worked up there because our goal was, of course, as with the other team, to be as frivolous as humanly possible while we lectured everybody that there was no frivolity. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1471.0s)]
*  And I think we nailed that. I think Jake nailed that in the producing to just opposing the shots. I was debating bringing heels because I studied her videos, Lauren Sanchez's videos, and she was in fact wearing heels. Oh, my God. She was wearing a necklace. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1485.0s)]
*  I was told I could not wear jewelry. It would hit me in the face. So, you know, a lot a lot was put at risk there. That's right. We were taking real risks and we are wearing the blonde origin hats. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1499.0s)]
*  That is our merch. You can go to shop, megan kelly dot com to get a variety of things either these hats that we all have the hats read. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1511.0s)]
*  Don't call it a ride. Have you been? There's a little notebook you can get with the label. I'm inspirational. There's a mug quoting Lauren Sanchez. So dark, so quiet. [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1520.0s)]
*  Lots of fun merch with our logo. I'm inspirational was my favorite. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1533.0s)]
*  It's I'm not sure I don't mark. You're the most seasoned journalist here. Does it work when the subject of a report tells the audience exactly what they should be feeling about her? [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1540.0s)]
*  Most journalists I know are more into show than tell but there was a lot of tell going a lot of tell going on there. I mean, I felt like it lead the horse to water and maybe it will drink. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1551.0s)]
*  All right. So we've got to talk for a minute about how this came about. So Maureen, we did our Meghan Markle parody and we were talking about these morons in that same two hour show we did two Fridays ago and how just how ridiculous they were and how self congratulatory. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1563.0s)]
*  Nobody would have made fun of them if they had just taken that flight and come back down and said that was really cool. Wow. Amazing. But they took themselves so seriously. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1582.0s)]
*  They literally were insisting that we call them astronauts. They were Gail lectured us on how inspirational she was. I mean, it would got crazier and crazier. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1589.0s)]
*  And so you and I, as we are want to do mock them mercilessly. And that night Doug and I went out to dinner and I was like, because we had played that Martha Stewart clip of her doing the zero G flight. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1597.0s)]
*  And I'm like, we have got to do it. We, we, Doug and I were talking about how I'm like, I got to get Maureen and we got to go back up there. And we were like, who else could we get? That's where you came in link. We were like, link would probably be our next victim. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1609.0s)]
*  But he, he was too afraid. So and he had no breast to show. So Sarah, Sarah was actually a good, good choice. And in any event, I said to Abby, can you contact these guys and see how expensive this flight would be? You know, because it's probably not cheap. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1625.0s)]
*  Literally the next day without Abby having yet contacted them, they contacted me. They had seen the segment and they had the same idea. Like she probably would love to come up here and give this a try. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1639.0s)]
*  So I didn't even have to hide from them. This whole, the whole thing was a massive troll. I didn't have to pretend like I'm taking this very seriously as like part of my astronaut training. They knew we were out there to laugh. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1653.0s)]
*  A lot of the people on the flight though, when we were singing at the end, I was like, oh my God, they're the way they were looking at us like these sick people. Who did they think they are? [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1663.0s)]
*  They were non astronaut trainers on board the flight who we tried to, you know, preserve the privacy of. But yeah, they were like, why are they taking themselves so seriously? [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1673.0s)]
*  So can I also just say, yeah, go ahead, like, no, I was just going to say watching this whole thing, I really realized Jeff Bezos is the smartest person on earth because he spent what 50 million, 100 million to have 11 minutes of peace from his whiny obnoxious wife. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1685.0s)]
*  I think every man out there is going to be jealous. Like if we can just spend like 10 minutes of peace from Lauren Sanchez, we would do it. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1700.0s)]
*  You know, I do. One of my observations was you watch them in that stupid, you know, vessel and yes, they're like they're floating around that each person makes it about herself, right? Like Katy Perry with her stupid daisy. [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1706.0s)]
*  I mean, I had my Strudwick and whatever. They're all just promoting something or themselves. You look at what we were doing. What were we doing? [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1718.0s)]
*  My lasting memory of the whole thing will be Maureen's amazing laugh. The best laugh ever. Like hearty, heartfelt and the three of us slamming down on the ground over and over and crawling all over each other like puppies. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1726.0s)]
*  We had so much fun. Right. That was I would do it again right now. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1742.0s)]
*  They couldn't they couldn't have fun while up there, nor could they make fun of themselves, which was less what spelled death for the whole project. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1746.0s)]
*  Moe thoughts. Yeah, 100%. I mean, the thing about the laughter, like I couldn't stop laughing. It was so wild. I felt like we were all babies, you know, like real babies. Like what are these limbs? What do they do? [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1755.0s)]
*  Like how do I get from point A to point B? Like some force is like picking me up and now I'm being slammed back down. And like I was just praying to myself that like we didn't actually hurt each other, you know, because we were all just like colliding constantly. [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1768.0s)]
*  It was the wildest experience. It was the most fun. And you're so right. Those guys couldn't even laugh and enjoy it. It's so freaking weird. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1782.0s)]
*  How do you come down and start lecturing everybody on how they need to be taking that kind of frivolity theirs and ours more seriously? I mean, it's like, they're so out of touch. They're still bitching about the backlash that they've received. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1792.0s)]
*  Katy Perry's out there now saying the Internet's a bunch of unhinged people, but I know my light and my. [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1807.0s)]
*  Like you guys, when it came to Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry and Gayle King, you guys are basically in a floating phallic penis. Okay, you guys are taking yourselves way too seriously for being up there in these perfectly tailored suits. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1813.0s)]
*  Like I said, they probably spent more time getting tailored and fitted for the suits than the 11 minutes they actually spent in space. So if they'd been in on the joke, we wouldn't be sitting here right now, but they take themselves so seriously. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1830.0s)]
*  I mean, we also had our zero gravity astronaut suits tailored. Yeah, we did. We had them taken in. And I'll show that as a bonus on Megyn Kelly dot com where we had a fitting or we tighter, tighter, cinch it, cinch it, make it. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1842.0s)]
*  We got had to push up bras on. I mean, we were channeling our inner blue origin astronauts were all in the same club now. And by the way, I did look it up. And if you have trained for outer space, which we clearly did, you're an astronaut. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1857.0s)]
*  You can call yourself that it was like a website called like girlbot.com, but it's counts. All right. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1873.0s)]
*  Equal part, equal part of homage and mockumentary. Exactly. So I feel like it was the perfect way to kick off the MK media network for you three. Maureen, Mark and Link, you are officially, as we say in the astronaut business, launched. [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1879.0s)]
*  Incredible. What an honor. And I would just like to add I was on such a time crunch. I did not get to have my spacesuit tailored, nor did I get to order the same kind of boots that you and Sarah were wearing, which I was very jealous of because they were like a slim line, but chunky boot with like a tread and a really nice heel. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1898.0s)]
*  Yeah, jealous jealous. Yeah, they're great. For those of you. Mine were from ASOS. Yeah. I mean, potential new merch. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1918.0s)]
*  Well, what's crazy about Blue Origin. What's crazy about Blue Origin is the left is all about body positivity and DEI. They did not send anyone up there with an ounce of body fat. They found the skinniest, tiniest women. They didn't send Lizzo up into space. They're like, we have a weight limit. We're finding the tiniest women we can to come back down. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1928.0s)]
*  Actually, can we send Lizzo into space? I think we now we can post Ozempic. She's on Ozempic now. Yeah. I do want to thank the good people of Zero Gravity and full disclosure, they did comp one of our tickets and yours truly pay for the rest and it was worth every penny. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1946.0s)]
*  I have never better spent my money. Not only did we do it, but I would do it again. I recommend all of you do it. Do take the Zofran because it can get a little dicey on the stomach, but you know nausea without vomiting. That's fine. That's that's a win. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1966.0s)]
*  I wish you guys were in studio so you could join us in this toast, but here's Lond Origin to Blonde Origin and to many more fun spoofs with all of you guys. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1981.0s)]
*  Cheers, dear. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1993.0s)]
*  Cheers, dear. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1995.0s)]
*  We need that bell. We need to ring the bell. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1997.0s)]
*  Yes, on the next space flight. Okay, my thanks to Maureen, to Mark, to Link, the stars of MK media, please go subscribe to their podcasts. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=1999.0s)]

*  But there are so many actually meritorious, deserving people whose names you should know and don't for actually doing something that does matter in their communities. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2103.0s)]

*  TAC stands for Teaching the Autism Community Trades. [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2147.0s)]
*  That inspired me to start thinking about like, hey, how can I get books to kids? [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2150.0s)]
*  Free books, free books! [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2154.0s)]
*  We'll just put some of these fairy tale books out. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2156.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think fairy tale would be a good theme for today. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2159.0s)]
*  Why is it not brought up that 90% of the autism community is unemployed? [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2162.0s)]
*  There is a giant demographic of people jumping up and down saying we want to work. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2166.0s)]
*  How dramatic an impact can a bike have? [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2171.0s)]
*  First, it gives people some dignity they can get to a job. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2173.0s)]
*  We're going to take care of your rent for the next 18 months. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2177.0s)]
*  $50,000. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2179.0s)]
*  Just like that, you got a TV show. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2187.0s)]
*  Yeah, people you should know. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2191.0s)]
*  Mike Rowe, great to see you. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2192.0s)]
*  Hi, Megan. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2193.0s)]
*  Cheers. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2194.0s)]
*  Cheers, my god. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2195.0s)]
*  What a thrill to be here, a wash in your victory and all of the import. [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2196.0s)]
*  One might be saying you feel inspired. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2202.0s)]
*  Well, I went beyond inspiration watching that. [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2206.0s)]
*  Did you go on? [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2209.0s)]
*  Well, I entered a... [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2210.0s)]
*  To bring it back to me for just a moment, I was reminded of my days as a fighter pilot. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2211.0s)]
*  I don't know if you knew I did that once upon a time. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2215.0s)]
*  No, no, do tell. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2217.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I didn't actually fly the planes, but I did go up in the back of an F-18 Hornet with the Blue Angels. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2218.0s)]
*  That counts. [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2224.0s)]
*  I thought so too. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2225.0s)]
*  You're there. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2226.0s)]
*  And look, I don't want to overstate it, but when I came out of that backseat after that flight, [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2227.0s)]
*  covered with my own vomit and freshly awakened from passing out, yeah, [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2234.0s)]
*  I was pretty sure I could have flown that thing if they would have given me a shot. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2241.0s)]
*  And to this day, the fact that they didn't, you know, it sticks with you, that kind of disappointment. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2245.0s)]
*  Yeah, that snub. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2251.0s)]
*  Yeah, but with time and professional help, I think I'm going to eventually get over it. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2252.0s)]
*  It's a little easier. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2258.0s)]
*  Probably not today. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2259.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, thankfully, I don't have that issue because people are recognizing me as an astronaut. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2260.0s)]
*  Sure. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2264.0s)]
*  I mean, you could see I had to get them in line and make them do it. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2265.0s)]
*  They were falling down in the job a little, but then they got there. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2268.0s)]
*  We actually did look up, like, tell us a little bit more about actual astronaut training because that's they are calling themselves astronauts. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2271.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2279.0s)]
*  And in Gail's defense, she says, I still have trouble calling myself that, but she does. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2280.0s)]
*  But she she worked her way through it. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2284.0s)]
*  She overcame. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2287.0s)]
*  OK, here's like a couple of the things. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2288.0s)]
*  All right. You there's spacewalk training and NASA's Neural Neutral Buoyancy Lab. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2290.0s)]
*  You study the space station systems flying a T-38 jet. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2294.0s)]
*  All of this is part of some astronaut training. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2299.0s)]
*  OK, there's you have to be a U.S. citizen. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2302.0s)]
*  You have to possess a master's degree in a STEM field, including engineering, biological science, physical science, computer science or mathematics. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2304.0s)]
*  I'm pretty sure that does not apply to Gail, Katie or Lauren Sanchez. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2310.0s)]
*  But OK, Lauren Sanchez is a pilot. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2313.0s)]
*  I'll give her that. She flies helicopters. [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2315.0s)]
*  You do have to have at least one thousand hours pilot and command time or two years of related professional experience. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2317.0s)]
*  Perfect visual acuity, blood pressure not to exceed 140 over 90, standing height between five to and six to excellent physical condition. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2323.0s)]
*  So actually, Lizzo is out. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2332.0s)]
*  And then you have to get you get selected by NASA. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2334.0s)]
*  They report for training and then they spend the next two years, two years, not two days like those morons in Blue Origin touted about their intensive training. [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2339.0s)]
*  Two years learning basic astronaut skills like spacewalking, operating the space station, flying T-38 jet planes and controlling a robotic arm. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2346.0s)]
*  You have to complete military water survival before beginning your flying syllabus. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2353.0s)]
*  You have to become scuba qualified to prepare for spacewalk training. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2357.0s)]
*  You are exposed to problems associated with high hyperbaric and low hypo baric atmospheric pressures in the altitude chambers to learn to deal with emergencies associated with these conditions. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2361.0s)]
*  And astronaut candidates are given exposure to the microgravity of spaceflight during flights in a modified jet aircraft as it performs parabolic maneuvers. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2372.0s)]
*  That's what we did. Hello. I'm an astronaut. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2379.0s)]
*  Just like I said, it's not learning how to buckle your seatbelt. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2381.0s)]
*  Right. But look, those are just requirements. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2384.0s)]
*  Nowhere in there do they talk about the qualities. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2387.0s)]
*  I'm like, you need a measure of patience. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2391.0s)]
*  Right. You need a you also need a measure of humility. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2394.0s)]
*  Yes. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2397.0s)]
*  That's impossible to quantify. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2398.0s)]
*  I wrote a story a few years ago for my podcast, not about Neil Armstrong, but about Buzz Aldrin, who of course was the second man, the lesser known. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2401.0s)]
*  Yes. And he told a little parenthetical tale that really stuck with me years ago about the time that he had to wait and just the just the place you go mentally. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2410.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2423.0s)]
*  And then the fact that all of a sudden he's got to pee. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2424.0s)]
*  He really has to pee. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2429.0s)]
*  And and as Neil Armstrong is literally taking one small step for mankind, Buzz is just filling his special little stadium pal. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2431.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2443.0s)]
*  Oh, stadium ball. Got it. [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2444.0s)]
*  With urine. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2445.0s)]
*  And so, you know, there's like, where do you put that in the like, no one writes about that. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2446.0s)]
*  But you do want to know that. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2452.0s)]
*  But that's also what being an astronaut is. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2453.0s)]
*  Sometimes you just have to stand quietly by after hours and hours and hours of patience while somebody else gets all the glory and you pee your pants. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2455.0s)]
*  I mean, this is like a theme when you come on that we talk about bathroom and toilet issues. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2464.0s)]
*  But let's be honest. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2468.0s)]
*  It's the other function that you'd really be dreading with all of the NASA controllers watching. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2469.0s)]
*  When you think about zero gravity and the effect that could have on the lower GI tract and the immediate results after an evacuation, I just yeah, I would have liked to have seen more of that in in this trip just to really just to really balance it out. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2474.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2489.0s)]
*  So you've got the glamour and you've got the excitement. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2490.0s)]
*  But just to remind people that that we're all put together the same basic way. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2492.0s)]
*  You just got little pieces of scat floating through the air. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2497.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2501.0s)]
*  And Sarah will remind me telling you that was her greatest fear. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2502.0s)]
*  She said when she gets really nervous or scared, sometimes she has a GI issue. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2504.0s)]
*  Well, when you're in zero gravity, that's everybody's greatest fear. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2509.0s)]
*  No one would turn away. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2511.0s)]
*  Poor Jake, I'd have to give hazard pay to is bad enough. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2513.0s)]
*  He had to risk his life. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2516.0s)]
*  But you know what? [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2517.0s)]
*  Back to my days as a fighter pilot, I'm not good. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2518.0s)]
*  When I talk about humility, like when you're in the back of that thing, and this was a private flight, they were spoiling me because I was hosting a show in San Francisco and they they wanted to show me the entire maneuvers of the Blue Angel experience. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2521.0s)]
*  So I'm strapped into the back of this thing. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2535.0s)]
*  And the captain tells me, look, he said, Mike, I've got two goals, and I'm going to be candid with you. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2537.0s)]
*  Three, really. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2542.0s)]
*  First, I'd like to make you pass out. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2543.0s)]
*  Secondly, I'm going to make you throw up. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2545.0s)]
*  And third, we're leaving with a full tank of gas. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2547.0s)]
*  So we're going to come back on empty. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2550.0s)]
*  And I'm going to show you everything from barrel rolls to the Immelman to all these great Red Baron type maneuvers. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2551.0s)]
*  And I didn't pass out because I knew the Hick maneuver. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2558.0s)]
*  Oh, the Hick. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2561.0s)]
*  So when you start pulling G's like six, seven, eight, nine. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2563.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm aware of the you understand as an astronaut. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2566.0s)]
*  Yeah, I got it. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2568.0s)]
*  You understand this. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2569.0s)]
*  You what's happening is the blood in your brain is being pulled down into your extremities. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2570.0s)]
*  And you've got to get the blood back in your brain. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2575.0s)]
*  So what you do is you grab the sides of your seat and you pull up hard and you dig your heels into the ground. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2577.0s)]
*  And then you make this sound. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2584.0s)]
*  You go. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2585.0s)]
*  Really? [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2586.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2589.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2590.0s)]
*  OK. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2591.0s)]
*  Oh, you are. [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2592.0s)]
*  You're going to be amazing. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2593.0s)]
*  I'm in. [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2594.0s)]
*  So all of that Hicking and all of that pulling and all of that pushing gets the blood back into your brain and it keeps you from passing out. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2595.0s)]
*  Now, a great pilot can do that simply by going. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2601.0s)]
*  Like, because that's a muscle that you build up. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2604.0s)]
*  Just to quickly interject, the folks who you see standing on that zero gravity flight are people who work for zero gravity. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2607.0s)]
*  And they've done it so many times they're not affected by it the way you or I would be. [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2613.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2616.0s)]
*  Now, with regards to nausea, there's not a damn thing you can do when this guy comes out of a barrel roll and you're Hicking and you're pulling like 11 G's and then you're over the Farallons and he flips the plane upside down and you're breaking the sound barrier and you're about 100 feet away from the ground. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2617.0s)]
*  And through the plexiglass dome over your head in an upside down inverted position, you can see the sonic concussions making the ocean pop. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2633.0s)]
*  And it's at that moment that you vomit onto the plexiglass and then he flips the plane back upside down and you sit there, Megan, Hicking, trying not to pass out as your own vomit drips onto your head. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2642.0s)]
*  It's horrible. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2656.0s)]
*  It's the essence of humility. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2657.0s)]
*  And it's what I meant before until you've sat there quietly contemplating your own choices in life while I'm at rain. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2659.0s)]
*  Yes, you're vomit. [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2666.0s)]
*  That's important. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2667.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2668.0s)]
*  Not somebody else's. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2669.0s)]
*  That's better. [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2670.0s)]
*  I'd rather be under my own. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2671.0s)]
*  I think it's the stuff of character. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2672.0s)]
*  Wait a minute. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2674.0s)]
*  So now with the benefit of hindsight, did you enjoy that ride? [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2675.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2678.0s)]
*  Well, yes. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2679.0s)]
*  I mean, it's a tricky question. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2680.0s)]
*  And first of all, it's not a ride. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2682.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2684.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2685.0s)]
*  I would think you of all people would be aware. [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2686.0s)]
*  Not a ride. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2688.0s)]
*  That was an adventure. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2689.0s)]
*  It's a mission. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2690.0s)]
*  And it wasn't just about me. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2691.0s)]
*  It was for all mankind. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2692.0s)]
*  Yes, I can understand the sacrifice. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2693.0s)]
*  But I'll tell you that I yes, I didn't enjoy it, but I loved it. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2695.0s)]
*  You're glad you did it. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2701.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2702.0s)]
*  So I'm so glad. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2703.0s)]
*  Well, because here's what happened to me when I was on the zero G. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2704.0s)]
*  The first two are lunar. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2709.0s)]
*  First three were like lunar gravity, which is not the full zero gravity. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2710.0s)]
*  So your whole body doesn't levitate up to the ceiling, but you do levitate a little. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2715.0s)]
*  And I was fine. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2719.0s)]
*  But the one rule they gave us is when you're in between the parabolas, you lie down and [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2721.0s)]
*  they said, do not lift your head. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2726.0s)]
*  If you lift your head against the G's, you are going to get sick. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2727.0s)]
*  Yep. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2730.0s)]
*  So of course I was I smushed myself down. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2731.0s)]
*  I'm like, OK, I'm not letting that happen. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2732.0s)]
*  Well, there was one parabola where the one guy was like, OK, get up, get up. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2734.0s)]
*  And we tried, but we couldn't. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2737.0s)]
*  So he had mistaken that we were it was time to levitate and it wasn't. [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2739.0s)]
*  And I did lift my head. [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2744.0s)]
*  And from that point forward, they were right. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2745.0s)]
*  I felt like I was going to hurl. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2747.0s)]
*  And I didn't thank God. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2749.0s)]
*  But you like halfway through that exercise, even though I still had fun, I was very worried [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2751.0s)]
*  that I was going to throw up. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2755.0s)]
*  What you had there was what the doctors call premature levitation. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2756.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2760.0s)]
*  And this can be awkward and embarrassing. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2761.0s)]
*  Especially as you get older. [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2763.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2764.0s)]
*  You think you know yourself. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2765.0s)]
*  Next thing that's not supposed to be like that now. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2766.0s)]
*  But how do you enjoy being an F 18? [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2770.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2773.0s)]
*  Like when you have thrown up, you feel nauseous and he keeps going. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2774.0s)]
*  Well, look, first of all, if you're me, like if you're the Dirty Jobs guy and you're in [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2778.0s)]
*  that position, you have one job and it's to not complain. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2784.0s)]
*  That's your only job. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2788.0s)]
*  So I wasn't about to do that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2790.0s)]
*  But I also like if you see the Blue Angels up close doing those maneuvers, it's awesome [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2793.0s)]
*  in the literal sense of the word. [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2801.0s)]
*  They're inches from each other going six, seven hundred miles an hour, all coordinated. [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2802.0s)]
*  It's a dance and the stakes couldn't be higher. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2807.0s)]
*  And these guys are so finely trained. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2810.0s)]
*  It's almost like a kind of singularity between human and machine. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2813.0s)]
*  And it's a wonder to watch it. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2819.0s)]
*  You know, what you're saying, you know, about not complaining is, of course, one of the [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2822.0s)]
*  main reasons that we're targeting them is they're just foolishness in messaging around [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2827.0s)]
*  the whole thing. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2831.0s)]
*  So they went from self aggrandizement to now complaining about the audience's reaction. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2832.0s)]
*  And and one of the lines on our mugs or in our hats is, have you been? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2837.0s)]
*  Because Gail in response to the criticism tried to shut up all of America by saying [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2842.0s)]
*  you can't criticize her unless you've been, which is why we went. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2849.0s)]
*  We now I've been and it's on under her own rules. [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2854.0s)]
*  It's on sister. [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2858.0s)]
*  I've now been your fair game. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2859.0s)]
*  And I find you even more absurd than I did before. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2861.0s)]
*  Well, look, not to pile on, but please do. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2864.0s)]
*  OK. In a way, you're you're you're working on a on a show called People You Shouldn't [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2867.0s)]
*  Know. Yes, because really in the end, it feels like we're surrounded by examples of good [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2874.0s)]
*  behavior, bad behavior, self-indulgent behavior, selfless behavior, whatever it is. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2883.0s)]
*  And, you know, I I loved I loved that story. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2889.0s)]
*  I loved watching it because ultimately I thought it was a teachable moment. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2893.0s)]
*  Sure. Not for them. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2898.0s)]
*  But really, the the audience does now have an opportunity to really think [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2900.0s)]
*  objectively and candidly about what did we just see? [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2906.0s)]
*  What are we celebrating? Why are we celebrating it? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2911.0s)]
*  Why are we being told this was important and and what are we to make of it? [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2914.0s)]
*  And if you're me trying to figure out how to how to navigate what's left of my career in this [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2920.0s)]
*  insane universe, it's it's like, well, do I want to focus on on those people or these people? [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2926.0s)]
*  And there's no right or wrong answer. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2934.0s)]
*  But it was just really fun watching what you just did and thinking about the difference between the [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2936.0s)]
*  people you were lampooning and the people I've been lucky enough to feature on shows like Dirty Jobs. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2944.0s)]
*  Celebrating. Yeah. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2949.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I hate to even say celebrating because it it's so adjacent to a level of [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2950.0s)]
*  earnestness that I think people ought to be wary of. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2955.0s)]
*  OK. I mean, it's a it's a well, I was celebrating them as I watched. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2959.0s)]
*  Yeah, but you were in on the joke. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2964.0s)]
*  No, your guys like your guys watch those guys. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2966.0s)]
*  Oh, like you sit. You want to stand up and cheer like the guy who makes the beds. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2969.0s)]
*  We can get into it. All right. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2973.0s)]
*  Stand back. We're going to take a break and then we'll talk a bit about it. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2974.0s)]
*  It is inspirational. And you're right that we could have called it people's [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2977.0s)]
*  you shouldn't know. And you're welcome to it. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2979.0s)]
*  We all know the only reason we know Gail is because she's Oprah's best friend. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2982.0s)]
*  I mean, that's very obvious to everybody. Stand by more with Mike ahead. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=2985.0s)]

*  I want to talk about your show, but before we do, we're on a great subject, which is like these rich and powerful people [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3091.0s)]
*  who are totally unaware of how people perceive them and how great their lives are and how little they should be [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3097.0s)]
*  complaining, period, never mind publicly, which leads me to Michelle Obama. [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3105.0s)]
*  Every day she's dropped another negativity bomb on us, whether on her podcast or on someone else's. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3111.0s)]
*  I mean, this audience knows she never says anything positive. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3117.0s)]
*  It is all complaints. So she goes on another podcast. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3121.0s)]
*  She's promoting her show, so she's making the rounds. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3125.0s)]
*  The Diary of a CEO podcast and actually found a way to bitch and moan about how hard it is to live in the White House. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3127.0s)]
*  When you walk through a storm, keep your head held high. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3138.0s)]
*  Show me, show me. Watch it. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3143.0s)]
*  It's projecting that if you win, which I thought he could and should, he would be somebody that I would want as my president. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3145.0s)]
*  It was all about this is going to, you know, our kids are little. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3152.0s)]
*  We're going to have to move. How do you raise kids in the White House? [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3157.0s)]
*  It's dangerous. Is the first black potential president. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3161.0s)]
*  We knew there would be death threats. [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3167.0s)]
*  There were just all the how we afford it because it's expensive to live in the White House. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3169.0s)]
*  Many people don't know. I mean, much is not covered. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3174.0s)]
*  You're paying for every food, every bit of food that you eat. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3179.0s)]
*  You know, you're not paying for housing and the staff in it, but everything, even travel. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3182.0s)]
*  If you're not traveling with the president, if your kids are coming on a bright star, which is the First Lady's plane, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3187.0s)]
*  we had to play pay for their travel to be on the plane. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3193.0s)]
*  It is an expensive proposition. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3197.0s)]
*  And you're running for two years and not earning an income. [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3199.0s)]
*  Please help me, Mike. Well, Megan, the struggle is real. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3204.0s)]
*  She's Louise. Have you ever heard anything so out of touch? [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3207.0s)]
*  Sure. But but not from anyone in that position. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3213.0s)]
*  They both have planes and she's mad that you have to pay the cost of an airline ticket for the daughters to fly on them. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3218.0s)]
*  I wonder. I mean, seriously, she's not a she's a smart woman. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3225.0s)]
*  She's aggrieved. She is immersed in a powerful and inescapable sense of grievance. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3231.0s)]
*  Do you think it's an attempt to to be relatable? [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3238.0s)]
*  No, no, no, she's she's angry. She thinks she's angry and unhappy. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3242.0s)]
*  I've watched enough of her over the years. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3246.0s)]
*  And then with this ridiculous podcast she's trying to launch to see she's a deeply unhappy person. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3248.0s)]
*  What's happening with with people at that level in podcasts? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3253.0s)]
*  What's Gavin Newsom doing? He's running for president. [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3256.0s)]
*  That one makes more sense to me strategically. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3259.0s)]
*  She's like she should be in her therapist's office. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3262.0s)]
*  Her brother, Craig, is not. Oh, he did. Yeah. [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3264.0s)]
*  What do you think I should do? I don't support it. Yeah. [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3267.0s)]
*  Well, my feeling is Gavin Newsom is using people to build up his skills so that he can more effectively debate the Republican nominee. [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3270.0s)]
*  And even if even if somebody goes on and cleans his clock. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3279.0s)]
*  Yeah, which basically happened when Charlie Kirk went on. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3282.0s)]
*  But it's that's not good. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3285.0s)]
*  Gavin Newsom took some blows, but emerged having learned something probably that he'll be better at handling in twenty twenty eight. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3287.0s)]
*  And I just don't think it's the job of the right to help train this guy. [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3296.0s)]
*  I likened it to the Rocky versus Drago Drago fight in Rocky four. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3299.0s)]
*  Why would we help train the Russian? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3304.0s)]
*  Do you think there was an argument that went the other way when Bill Maher went to the White House? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3305.0s)]
*  Like you hear like Larry David wrote that editorial, my dinner with Adolf. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3310.0s)]
*  And there's this idea that it's like, look, that's a bridge too far. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3315.0s)]
*  And you're just simply lending credibility by the very proximity of your presence. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3319.0s)]
*  I get both. You know, I think I think that makes no sense. [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3325.0s)]
*  If the president of the United States invites you for dinner, you should go. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3328.0s)]
*  No matter who I would have gone if it were Joe Biden, Barack Obama in a heartbeat. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3332.0s)]
*  I would do that. You get to see the White House. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3335.0s)]
*  Trump is very he's a gratuitous when you come there. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3338.0s)]
*  He's gracious is the word I'm looking for. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3342.0s)]
*  He gives everybody a tour. [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3344.0s)]
*  It seems like almost everybody is shown the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3345.0s)]
*  Who wouldn't want to see that? [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3348.0s)]
*  In fact, we have something very funny on this. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3349.0s)]
*  Elon Musk just made news last night. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3351.0s)]
*  Do we have that? You guys, we cut that on what happens when he sleeps over. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3353.0s)]
*  At the White House. Do we have it? I can't hear. [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3357.0s)]
*  Let's if we have it, let's play it. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3359.0s)]
*  Oh, it's not on tape. Oh, shit. [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3361.0s)]
*  OK, it's just him. Well, I remember what he said. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3363.0s)]
*  He said, I'll be flying back with him, like on the helicopter or an Air Force one. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3365.0s)]
*  He'll be like, do you want to stay over? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3369.0s)]
*  You know, like kids having a sleepover and they'll say, sure, I'll stay over. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3370.0s)]
*  And he says, I sleep in the Lincoln bedroom. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3373.0s)]
*  And then Trump always calls me like nine o'clock at night and says, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3375.0s)]
*  Hey, should go down to the kitchen and get yourself something to eat. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3378.0s)]
*  There's a bunch of ice cream down there. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3380.0s)]
*  So I find myself in the White House kitchen eating a tub of ice cream like a scene from a movie. [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3381.0s)]
*  Caramel, he said. Don't tell Robert F. Kennedy, Jr. [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3386.0s)]
*  So, yeah, it's like having. But I have to tell you something. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3389.0s)]
*  I know a friend who went to the White House with his wife and Trump one point [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3392.0s)]
*  and had almost the same story. They slept in Lincoln bedroom. [[00:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3397.0s)]
*  Trump offered them the ice cream. So not to take away Elon's specialness. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3400.0s)]
*  But my point is, he's very gracious and he's like a caretaker. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3404.0s)]
*  Everybody says that about Trump. You go to golf with him or a lago or any one of his properties. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3408.0s)]
*  I'm constantly making sure that you've got drinks and you've got food and you're happy. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3412.0s)]
*  Anyway, I just think I don't know how we got on this line, but back to Michelle Obama. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3417.0s)]
*  She's not happy. She's unhappy and she wants you to be too. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3421.0s)]
*  She looks around at the immense opulence around her. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3425.0s)]
*  She's literally complaining about the fact that even though the White House is free, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3428.0s)]
*  the home is free. The staff are free. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3432.0s)]
*  The fifty five thousand square foot home, by the way, on 18 acres is free. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3435.0s)]
*  But she has to pay for her own food, Mike. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3439.0s)]
*  She's got to pay for her groceries like everyone in America. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3441.0s)]
*  No justice, no peace. It's like, oh God, I forgot what I was going to say. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3446.0s)]
*  I know we're getting old and the champagne. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3453.0s)]
*  I know it's going to what was it? I think it was something to do with the. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3455.0s)]
*  Oh, you mentioned Lincoln bedroom. I was at the Henry Ford Museum last night at this event. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3458.0s)]
*  They have the chair from Ford's theater that Lincoln was sitting when he was assassinating. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3463.0s)]
*  And I and I stood next to it and I did something I never do. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3470.0s)]
*  I like I took a picture and I'm not a sentimental person like that. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3474.0s)]
*  But the Lincoln bedroom, the chair where he was sitting and right around the corner is the bus where Rosa Parks refused to move. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3478.0s)]
*  You can sit in the seat where she sat. These these artifacts, they're they're very powerful. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3487.0s)]
*  And it's and it's really easy to like minimize them and even dismiss them and not live in wonder in their in their presence. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3494.0s)]
*  That's what galls me about what we're talking about. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3504.0s)]
*  The the privilege to be in that house. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3507.0s)]
*  I mean, if you think about Adams and if you think about all the presidents who came before and all the families who who lived there [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3511.0s)]
*  and then make a list of the people who had that privilege, who who made the complaints that we're talking about now, there's nobody on that list. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3518.0s)]
*  That just didn't happen. No, I got this thing called a sweat pledge. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3527.0s)]
*  If you apply for a scholarship from my foundation, you have to sign it. [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3531.0s)]
*  And the very first tenant on it says, I believe I have hit the greatest lottery of all time. [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3535.0s)]
*  I'm alive. I walk the earth. I live in America. Above all things, I'm grateful. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3543.0s)]
*  I have it there simply because I think I think it's impossible to feel sorry for yourself if your fundamental default position is gratitude. [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3547.0s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, and and and those are the people that I'm I'm trying to surround myself by and and help. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3557.0s)]
*  And I've gone in a different direction. It's fine. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3565.0s)]
*  This is also gratifying in its own way. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3568.0s)]
*  But I to your point, it was just yesterday and you know, it's spring. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3571.0s)]
*  It's gorgeous. It's getting to be the good part of spring. [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3576.0s)]
*  The first half is so cold in the Northeast. It's really just a lame winter. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3579.0s)]
*  But now we're getting May is spectacular. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3583.0s)]
*  And it happens like almost overnight where you go from empty branches to branches in full flower. [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3585.0s)]
*  And, you know, the birds chirping and the flowers blooming, everything. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3591.0s)]
*  And I I was looking out my window thinking like how many of these you get, you know, if you're lucky, if you're really lucky, you get 85 or 90 of these. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3595.0s)]
*  Yeah. You know, and we're here on borrowed time. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3605.0s)]
*  Like this doesn't belong to us. It belongs to God. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3608.0s)]
*  It belongs to the universe. It belongs to the next generation and the one after that. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3611.0s)]
*  So we're renters, right? Not owners, stewards. [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3615.0s)]
*  And you look out, you just think savor it. Stop looking at your stupid device in your hand. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3618.0s)]
*  Take in the flowering blooms. [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3623.0s)]
*  Smell the honeysuckle. Be glad to be alive. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3625.0s)]
*  Like treasure it right now. You know, and I know it's trite. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3628.0s)]
*  Everybody knows no tomorrow tomorrow's promised. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3631.0s)]
*  But every once in a while you get one of those moments and it's a gift. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3634.0s)]
*  Right. Because you do think I'm but a humble servant and I'm so lucky just to be here. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3636.0s)]
*  It's not some fancy house or fancy car or the fucking fifty five thousand square foot White House around you. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3643.0s)]
*  It's those flowers. It's your rose garden, Michelle. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3650.0s)]
*  But it's your children. It's the way their hair smells. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3653.0s)]
*  It's like all the greatness stuff that actually gets you out of bed in the morning. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3656.0s)]
*  And what are the common people as William Shatner or pulp before him would have put it? [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3660.0s)]
*  What are we to make of a person who has risen to that great height who appears so dissatisfied with it? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3666.0s)]
*  I mean, never mind all the other personal stuff. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3678.0s)]
*  It's like that alone. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3682.0s)]
*  If you're a young person trying to figure out, you know, what's the path to a to a self-actualized life? [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3684.0s)]
*  What what might have to happen in my world for me to feel as though I accomplished a thing or did a thing or built a thing or or made a thing? [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3693.0s)]
*  And then you hear somebody who who rose to that level talk about all of the adversity and all of the challenges and all the disappointment and the racist country. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3702.0s)]
*  It right. It's it's it's kind of sad on a on a personal level. [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3711.0s)]
*  But I would say it's it's kind of dangerous if you're trying to find a way to inspire a generation who who kidding aside needs to be inspired, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3716.0s)]
*  not with some publicity stunt flight and not with all these other things, but like with with real things that you can actually do in your life. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3728.0s)]
*  Like who who is out there with that message in a non earnest way, like in a genuine way. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3738.0s)]
*  I I look to people like former presidents and and family members of former presidents to to talk about the great good fortune and the incredible wonder that was bestowed upon. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3745.0s)]
*  And I don't even care if it's sincere. I don't either. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3757.0s)]
*  I just want them to say that as people who used to be in like that position of power for us. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3759.0s)]
*  Yeah, he and she seem completely polar opposite. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3763.0s)]
*  I actually think Barack Obama is an optimistic, relatively sunny person in his messaging and in the way he experiences the world, especially himself. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3766.0s)]
*  But I just think in general, he's more much more glass half full. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3773.0s)]
*  And she is I don't know if you're born with that or if you're raised wrong with parents who encourage you to lean into grievance as opposed to look out the window. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3777.0s)]
*  I'll tell you just on the micro front, I had an experience you would appreciate. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3786.0s)]
*  Was it yesterday I came back from D.C. [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3791.0s)]
*  We interviewed Tulsi and I took the train and I'm walking through the train station. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3793.0s)]
*  And this is actually down in the D.C. end. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3798.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's dark and it's dank and it smells like oil and fumes. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3801.0s)]
*  And it's kind of unpleasant for a minute there. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3806.0s)]
*  You're like, I think I'm actively causing my lung cancer right now. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3808.0s)]
*  And then I see this guy who is up on forgive me. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3811.0s)]
*  You probably know what this is called, but I don't. [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3815.0s)]
*  It looks like a crane. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3817.0s)]
*  It's one of those things that the telephone guys get up on that takes him to the top of the cherry picker. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3818.0s)]
*  OK, yeah. So he's up on one of those and he's working on the top of like he's not on the top of a train. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3821.0s)]
*  He's on like the ceiling that's got like those rails and he's doing something dangerous and important. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3826.0s)]
*  And he looked young, Mike. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3831.0s)]
*  He looked like 20 and he looked like he was having the time of his life. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3833.0s)]
*  He was laughing. He's yelling down to a buddy down below. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3837.0s)]
*  They were joking. He was smiling. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3840.0s)]
*  He was covered in dirt to your, you know, your life motto. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3842.0s)]
*  And I thought, look at this guy in this dark, dank, smelly, dirty place with lots of danger, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3846.0s)]
*  not just this cherry picker, but also the live rail that he's working on, all the wires, having a great time. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3852.0s)]
*  And then you look at her and she's still there. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3860.0s)]
*  They have to be billionaires by now. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3863.0s)]
*  Sure. Out on the yachts, the Martha's Vineyard, 22 million dollar estate, [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3865.0s)]
*  and the totally thriving young daughters who went to Harvard and USC. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3869.0s)]
*  It's never going to be good enough. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3873.0s)]
*  It's a it's a mind frame, right? [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3875.0s)]
*  It's like your choice of how you're going to go through this life. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3878.0s)]
*  So the night before I went to this event at the Ford Museum, I was in the hotel bar at the Henry, which is there in Dearborn. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3880.0s)]
*  And coincidentally, I ran into the guy who was going to be interviewing me the next night. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3890.0s)]
*  And we're sitting at the bar having a drink, getting to know each other. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3894.0s)]
*  And out of nowhere, 50 young men appear. [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3897.0s)]
*  They had all been flown in by Ford. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3901.0s)]
*  These are master technicians and senior master technicians all over the country. [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3903.0s)]
*  So once a year, they bring in the best of the best for a kind of a celebration. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3907.0s)]
*  It's a fun boondoggle, you know, for the cream of the crop. [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3911.0s)]
*  Now, these guys have memorized every episode of Dirty Jobs. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3915.0s)]
*  They grow up. And and, you know, I had to check myself because for for a minute, I'm completely focused on this event. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3917.0s)]
*  I have to prepare for and here I am talking to the guy who's going to interview me. [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3926.0s)]
*  And then he comes up and he wants a selfie or whatever. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3929.0s)]
*  And I say, sure. And I start to talk to him and his lip starts to tremble and he's got like a tear in his eye. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3932.0s)]
*  And he's telling me about the day he decided that he was going to be a mechanic. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3938.0s)]
*  It was during an episode of Dirty Jobs and he applied for a scholarship from my foundation. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3943.0s)]
*  And now I'm sitting there like a big squish going, oh, it's so great to hear. [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3949.0s)]
*  And they they stood up, all 50 of them. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3955.0s)]
*  And I stood there for two hours and the whole evening went off the rails with the help of a little bourbon. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3957.0s)]
*  And and I just listened to story after story after story after story of these men who and three women among them, just to be clear. [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3963.0s)]
*  But it's still fundamentally a man's game. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3973.0s)]
*  These guys didn't go to college. They learned a skill that was in demand. [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3976.0s)]
*  And now they're killing it. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3979.0s)]
*  And there's the this I know I said I wasn't earnest or sentimental about it, but I swear to God, Megan, when you when you sit there and listen to story after story of guys who who mastered a skill that was in demand and then went to work. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3981.0s)]
*  And now they're raising their families. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3996.0s)]
*  Many of them have no debt. They're not saddled with some awful college millstone around their neck. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=3999.0s)]
*  They're thriving and they're proud and they're hopeful. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4005.0s)]
*  And most importantly, they're enthused. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4008.0s)]
*  They're enthused. [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4012.0s)]
*  And every everything we've talked about so far is the first example is a perfect example of exaggerated and false enthusiasm. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4014.0s)]
*  The second one, when you're talking about Michelle Obama, it's just an absence of enthusiasm, just an absence of of joy. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4025.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4033.0s)]
*  And yeah, I guess we're making the same point. [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4034.0s)]
*  But my life today, by and large, is is blessed primarily because strangers come up to me to tell me about the time they paid their dues to tell me about the time work mattered most to them. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4037.0s)]
*  And it's important for them to be heard. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4051.0s)]
*  And and that's a big part of my job these days. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4055.0s)]
*  Will you make it your business? [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4058.0s)]
*  I mean, when I was watching Episode one about Lenzi, L-E-N-Z-Y, I thought this is such a great way to spend your time. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4060.0s)]
*  Like Mike Rowe makes good life decisions, which is why there's like this peacefulness to you. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4068.0s)]
*  There's a you sort of emanate this positivity. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4073.0s)]
*  It's a champagne. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4075.0s)]
*  More than the average Joe, I have to say you do. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4076.0s)]
*  And like you make it a point of spending your life around these people. [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4079.0s)]
*  And even like this this poor woman talks to you openly about how for 10 years she was on meth. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4082.0s)]
*  And you were saying like I didn't I didn't know somebody had a story of 10 years on meth. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4089.0s)]
*  I didn't either. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4093.0s)]
*  Right. I really didn't think I thought you lost your teeth and then you lost your name and then you're never heard from again. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4094.0s)]
*  And then probably your life in most cases. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4099.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4100.0s)]
*  But she didn't lose her life. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4101.0s)]
*  She turned her life around and she devotes herself to helping other people. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4103.0s)]
*  Now, she found an organization called Care Portal. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4107.0s)]
*  And Care Portal is a virtual entryway into this legion of bloody do-gooders oftentimes arranged around local churches, but not always. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4111.0s)]
*  And it's it's a way to know when somebody in your community is really struggling. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4122.0s)]
*  And the the overriding purpose is to try and keep families together. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4130.0s)]
*  The foster care system is a problem. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4134.0s)]
*  It's a shame. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4136.0s)]
*  It really is. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4137.0s)]
*  It's a it's a necessary thing in many cases, but it's not a good choice. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4138.0s)]
*  If you if you can keep a family together by hook or crook, you have to try. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4143.0s)]
*  And Care Portal has had unbelievable success at doing this. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4148.0s)]
*  And when I heard the story of this woman who very nearly lost everything, but Care Portal saved her and then now she's dedicated her life to Care Portal, it's like, all right. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4151.0s)]
*  I call the crew. [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4162.0s)]
*  We go. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4163.0s)]
*  We hang out with her. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4164.0s)]
*  We basically lied to her and tell her she's the subject of a documentary. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4165.0s)]
*  And she's just like a cog in the wheel. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4168.0s)]
*  She's not just special. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4171.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4172.0s)]
*  And then at the end, we we surprise her with an elaborate gift. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4173.0s)]
*  Are we allowed to say I wouldn't know because it's big. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4177.0s)]
*  It's big. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4180.0s)]
*  It's big. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4181.0s)]
*  And look, people laugh and they cry. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4182.0s)]
*  And again, back to the earnest thing, it's impossible to talk about this topic and not be earnest. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4184.0s)]
*  But the show itself is not really a feel good show. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4189.0s)]
*  It's the making of a feel good show. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4192.0s)]
*  What I love about it is you're very honest on it. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4194.0s)]
*  And that, of course, we've talked many times in the show about how if you're not authentic with this audience, you die. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4197.0s)]
*  And so you'll be like, that was boring. [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4203.0s)]
*  Who says that in the middle of their own show? [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4206.0s)]
*  Yeah, like it's sometimes in the middle of a sentence. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4208.0s)]
*  I should not have started that sentence because I have no real clear understanding of how it's going to end. [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4211.0s)]
*  You're very open with the audience about how you're experiencing the making of it. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4215.0s)]
*  Let's just look at a clip. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4218.0s)]
*  This is Lindsay in episode one. [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4219.0s)]
*  This is Lindsay Phillips. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4222.0s)]
*  We're fighting the foster care system. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4223.0s)]
*  I'm just here for the cheap labor then? [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4225.0s)]
*  Load up the car? [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4226.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4227.0s)]
*  I was actually a family in need back in 2020. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4228.0s)]
*  I was not in a good place at all. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4230.0s)]
*  I was so elated of the help that I received that I just decided I really want to serve in my community as well. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4232.0s)]
*  It's not transactional. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4239.0s)]
*  It's transformative. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4240.0s)]
*  If it seems like we're making it up as we go along, that's because as we go along, we're making it up. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4241.0s)]
*  She has no idea what's about to happen. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4248.0s)]
*  This is pretty good right there. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4251.0s)]
*  Lindsay! Lindsay! Lindsay! [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4253.0s)]
*  And it only gets better from there. [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4257.0s)]
*  And it's not just Lindsay. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4259.0s)]
*  Can you talk about the guy with the beds? [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4260.0s)]
*  Sure. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4262.0s)]
*  In this episode, one of the things that is at the top of the list in the care portal is a need for beds. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4263.0s)]
*  So many kids sleep on the floor in this country. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4272.0s)]
*  Break your heart. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4274.0s)]
*  Well, years ago on returning the favor, which was the Facebook program on which this project is based, [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4275.0s)]
*  I met a guy called Luke Mickelson. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4281.0s)]
*  And he had an organization, still does, up in Idaho called Sleep in Heavenly Peace. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4283.0s)]
*  He and his merry band of do-gooders, they make bunk beds and wooden beds, and they give them to kids in the town. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4291.0s)]
*  No kid in Luke's town sleeps on the floor, right? [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4298.0s)]
*  He had six chapters when we profiled him. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4300.0s)]
*  Today he has over 400. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4303.0s)]
*  So the crazy thing about this show that isn't really a show is that it's a window into do-goodery and local kindness. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4305.0s)]
*  The same way Dirty Jobs was a rumination on honest work, this is a rumination on the neighbors you wish you had. [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4318.0s)]
*  And also, it's weirdly relevant to everything we've talked about, [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4324.0s)]
*  but the people that we feature are obviously not supermodels. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4329.0s)]
*  They're not your classic aspirational, like, oh my God, I want to be just like that. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4335.0s)]
*  It's the opposite of Blue Origin. [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4339.0s)]
*  These really are your neighbors. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4341.0s)]
*  These are just people who happened to give a damn and did something about it. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4343.0s)]
*  And the thing that I like most about it, when you stack those examples together, [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4348.0s)]
*  what it does is it gently taps you on the shoulder. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4353.0s)]
*  It says, look, man, you don't have to boil the ocean, but if she can do it, she was, by her own admission, her own words, [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4358.0s)]
*  Mike, I was a full-on meth head. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4366.0s)]
*  It had me bad. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4368.0s)]
*  And when it came right down to it, I saw me losing my kids or getting my shit together. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4369.0s)]
*  And she got it together. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4374.0s)]
*  And like in that moment, which she confesses to me, why would I? [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4376.0s)]
*  We have to pull over because she's crying and we're on a highway. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4380.0s)]
*  And I'm like, oh, this is a hell of a way to get to the moment I want to get to. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4383.0s)]
*  But we get there. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4386.0s)]
*  And when she tells me what she tells me, I can hear it in my, you know, you've been in the business forever. [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4388.0s)]
*  You know when it lands. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4393.0s)]
*  And by that, I just mean I know people will watch this who will absolutely relate maybe not to her specific circumstance, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4396.0s)]
*  but to that feeling of that's it. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4405.0s)]
*  I'm out of cards. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4408.0s)]
*  My back is against the wall. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4409.0s)]
*  There's no way out. [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4410.0s)]
*  What's extraordinary, too, is that she gets help. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4411.0s)]
*  She turns her life around and then she gives back. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4414.0s)]
*  I think it's probably very easy to just skip that last step and try to stay treading water. [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4417.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4423.0s)]
*  You know, and worried that if you do try to help the next drowning man, you're going to go down to it. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4424.0s)]
*  They don't have the emotional reserves. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4428.0s)]
*  A lot of folks to go back for the next guy. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4430.0s)]
*  Well, here's the dirty little secret. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4433.0s)]
*  When you go back for the next guy, the guy you're saving is yourself. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4436.0s)]
*  And it's kind of an Ayn Randian way to think about altruism, you know, but I happen to subscribe to it. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4441.0s)]
*  I think there's a righteous selfishness in this level of philanthropy. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4449.0s)]
*  And because most people I know are selfish, I don't shy away from that. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4455.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's fine. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4460.0s)]
*  Whatever your motivation. [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4461.0s)]
*  It makes you feel good to to help your neighbor. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4462.0s)]
*  Well, that's not much different than a fireman. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4466.0s)]
*  You interview those people who sign up to do that thing. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4468.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4473.0s)]
*  They want to help their fellow man. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4474.0s)]
*  They want to make a difference. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4475.0s)]
*  But many, many times you peel back the layers far enough and you'll find somebody who's trying to help themself. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4476.0s)]
*  The masks come down in the plane when you lose the air pressure. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4483.0s)]
*  Job one. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4487.0s)]
*  Put it on your face first. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4489.0s)]
*  I know this as an astronaut. [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4491.0s)]
*  Of course you do. [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4492.0s)]
*  And as a fighter pilot, I learned it early on prior to all the vomiting. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4493.0s)]
*  But, you know, it's a lesson that really, really sticks. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4497.0s)]
*  You're of zero use to the people around you if you can't get your own poop in a group. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4500.0s)]
*  OK, now you're obsessed with this. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4505.0s)]
*  You're back on the second bodily function. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4507.0s)]
*  And I'm going to tie it all together now. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4509.0s)]
*  I can move on to three if you want, but I don't know if it's that kind of shit. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4511.0s)]
*  I've got a crack team. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4514.0s)]
*  And this is how this is why I get paid the big bucks here at the Megyn Kelly show. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4515.0s)]
*  I will now tie together everything the audience has heard in the last hour and a half with this clip from when Mike Rowe interviewed astronaut Scott Tingle. [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4520.0s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4532.0s)]
*  The people just want to know how you poop, man. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4533.0s)]
*  And what is going on up there? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4535.0s)]
*  So the system is very complex. [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4537.0s)]
*  So not only do we have to contain, but we have to transport your eliminations or your waste. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4540.0s)]
*  And to do that, we use airflow. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4550.0s)]
*  So there's airflow that comes in and around and pulls, transports your solid waste into a bag that's perforated. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4553.0s)]
*  And then you gather the bag, you tidy it up and you throw it into a bucket. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4561.0s)]
*  And you keep the bucket tamped down because you don't have a whole lot of storage space. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4567.0s)]
*  And then every, I don't know, seven days, six or seven days, depending on how many crew are up there, we got a lot of crew up there now. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4571.0s)]
*  So maybe five days, you have to replace those buckets and those buckets go onto a garbage or onto a cargo vehicle that is taking garbage back. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4578.0s)]
*  And then it goes back to earth. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4587.0s)]
*  And most of the time for the garbage haulers burn up on entry and it just gets incinerated. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4589.0s)]
*  OK, for the listening audience, for the first half of that sound bite, Mike Rose listening to him like he's watching the Gettysburg Address. [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4597.0s)]
*  The seriousness with which you listened. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4603.0s)]
*  I really think you thought you were going up in space the next day. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4607.0s)]
*  This is this is issue number one. You needed to work out before doing it. [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4611.0s)]
*  What's funny, if I remember, as I was interviewing, I myself was personally overcome with the need and I couldn't I couldn't tear myself away. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4614.0s)]
*  So as you're watching that, I'm wrestling with my own O-ring. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4622.0s)]
*  Wishing you had a perforated bag. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4625.0s)]
*  But let me tell you about that. That guy, Scott Tingle, humbled me in a way. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4627.0s)]
*  I was in New Orleans and I got a call from NASA. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4632.0s)]
*  I'm shooting down there on something totally unrelated. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4635.0s)]
*  Scott was in the space station and once a month NASA gives these guys a chance to make a couple of phone calls, not not to their family, but really to anyone. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4637.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4648.0s)]
*  And there's the special encoded iPads and NASA overnighted me one. [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4649.0s)]
*  So I'm sitting in a hotel in New Orleans getting through all these crazy codes and uplinks and so forth. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4655.0s)]
*  And Scott Tingle had decided that he wanted to talk to me. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4661.0s)]
*  I was his I was his phone call for the month. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4665.0s)]
*  Surprise to you. You didn't know him. [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4668.0s)]
*  No, I'd never I'd never heard of him. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4670.0s)]
*  But but but with a name like Tingle, I'm going to take the call. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4672.0s)]
*  So he's an astronaut. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4676.0s)]
*  He'd been up in the space station for months and we have this that wasn't that interview. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4677.0s)]
*  That's a very private conversation. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4682.0s)]
*  And it was all for the first time. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4684.0s)]
*  Yeah, this is also private anyway. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4686.0s)]
*  But I mean, what do you if you're me, what do you do with that? [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4688.0s)]
*  You know, you're just living your life compliment. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4693.0s)]
*  NASA calls. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4695.0s)]
*  There's an astronaut who wants to talk to you. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4696.0s)]
*  And so one of the questions I asked him in that conversation was if you got the call, [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4698.0s)]
*  because he's got a family and he's a he's an engineer, of course, and a real astronaut. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4705.0s)]
*  And he is a real fan of my foundation, which, by the way, shameless plug last week for work ethic scholarships, [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4710.0s)]
*  giving away three million bucks, micro works, dot org, go get some. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4716.0s)]
*  I say to him, Scott, if you got the call to go to Mars, would and that's as far as I got. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4720.0s)]
*  And he said, oh, yeah. Are you kidding me? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4727.0s)]
*  I'd go right now. I'd leave from here right now. [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4729.0s)]
*  That's a year out. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4733.0s)]
*  Nine months back, if you get the telemetry right, your family is he's like, no, look, I I love my family more than anything. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4735.0s)]
*  But I'm on this earth or in this case off of it because I know who I am and I know what my mission is and I know what my purpose is. [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4742.0s)]
*  That's the word, Megan. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4751.0s)]
*  If you're looking for a way to land this plane, what didn't that Blue Origin mission have a purpose? [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4753.0s)]
*  Not really. You know, that's a purpose driven dude. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4762.0s)]
*  And for me, my life gets exponentially more enjoyable. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4766.0s)]
*  The more of those people that I meet such a nice compliment to you, Mike, that he chose you. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4773.0s)]
*  What a very cool call to receive. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4777.0s)]
*  I am I'm humbled every week by something. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4779.0s)]
*  But that one actually took the wind out of me. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4784.0s)]
*  Well, we were talking about this in the break privately, but I'm so much sure you'll talk about it publicly here. [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4786.0s)]
*  This is not the first time somebody has at random just called you up and asked you to do something and you have no idea why they chose you. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4792.0s)]
*  Recently, I was once again on the Time 100 list. [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4799.0s)]
*  Oh, congratulations. [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4806.0s)]
*  Yes, thank you very much. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4807.0s)]
*  They basically needed a conservative quota filled. [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4808.0s)]
*  And so they they do a write up in Time magazine about you. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4811.0s)]
*  And I knew that from the first time. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4817.0s)]
*  Yeah, but the first time it happened, they actually asked me who I wanted to have write it up. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4820.0s)]
*  And I said my boss, Bray Hume, and he did it. [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4825.0s)]
*  But this time around, they never asked. [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4828.0s)]
*  I figured out maybe they don't do those anymore. [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4830.0s)]
*  I don't whatever. [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4831.0s)]
*  Then I read it. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4832.0s)]
*  It hit online and it was Laura Trump who wrote it up. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4833.0s)]
*  A lovely, lovely little like blurb about yours truly. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4836.0s)]
*  She didn't tell me she was doing. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4840.0s)]
*  I know her a little. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4842.0s)]
*  Not well. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4843.0s)]
*  I text her. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4844.0s)]
*  I mean, like, this is so kind of you. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4846.0s)]
*  She's very busy and like a really, really appreciate it. [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4848.0s)]
*  Like, very grateful. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4850.0s)]
*  Didn't have to do it. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4851.0s)]
*  But you did. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4852.0s)]
*  You got one of these. [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4853.0s)]
*  Well, you were also on the Time 100. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4855.0s)]
*  Yes, I was on the same list. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4857.0s)]
*  You were just not as one of the most influential. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4859.0s)]
*  I was one of the 100 people chosen to write about one of the most influential people like Laura Trump. [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4862.0s)]
*  And for whatever reason, Time asked me to write 150 words, no more, no less about Joe Rogan. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4869.0s)]
*  And I did. [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4876.0s)]
*  So what? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4877.0s)]
*  And do you don't know why you guys are not like really close? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4878.0s)]
*  You and he? [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4881.0s)]
*  I've done a show once and it went very well. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4882.0s)]
*  And what I said about Joe in my write up was I can't tell you that I enjoyed every moment of my interview with Joe Rogan. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4885.0s)]
*  But that's only because he didn't interview me. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4895.0s)]
*  He talked to me. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4897.0s)]
*  And that's his secret sauce. [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4899.0s)]
*  When he gets it right and he often does, it's a conversation. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4901.0s)]
*  And I'll tell you again, I'm not telling you anything you don't know, but you can bullshit anybody for 20 minutes or an hour, maybe. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4905.0s)]
*  Probably not 90. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4913.0s)]
*  Definitely not two. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4915.0s)]
*  And you sure as hell can't do it for three. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4916.0s)]
*  So true. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4918.0s)]
*  So you get in the third hour of a conversation with the leader of a country or a CEO of a company. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4919.0s)]
*  You're going to get a version of you're going to get something authentic for better or worse. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4926.0s)]
*  And, you know, I don't I can't listen to his podcast all the time because I don't have three hours at a time to do it. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4933.0s)]
*  And for a long time, I kind of poo pooed that. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4940.0s)]
*  But with this election and Trump's decision to go on and Harris's decision not to go on, that became apocryphal. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4943.0s)]
*  That was amazing to watch and and and determinative. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4953.0s)]
*  And and I knew exactly what I wanted to say about Joe. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4957.0s)]
*  It was all about the third hour, the hour nobody listens to, but is nevertheless quite possibly the most consequential hour in media today. [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4961.0s)]
*  It's very cool. [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4969.0s)]
*  I mean, I do feel the need to point out once again with the poo pooed. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4970.0s)]
*  It's it's like an obsession. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4974.0s)]
*  Look, I know my audience. [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4976.0s)]
*  And in this case, I know it's you. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4978.0s)]
*  And I know that deep down, you're an eight year old girl who just who just wants to pull my finger to see what might happen. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4980.0s)]
*  You have me figured out entirely. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4986.0s)]
*  This is why we bonded. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4987.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4989.0s)]
*  Great. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4990.0s)]
*  Stand by. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4991.0s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4992.0s)]
*  I think you know where the conversation is going to go next. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4993.0s)]
*  His new show is called People You Should Know. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4995.0s)]
*  It's on his YouTube channel, The Real Mike Rowe. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=4998.0s)]
*  Check it out tonight. [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5001.0s)]
*  Paleo Valley makes 100 percent grass fed beef sticks because healthy living should be easy and accessible for everyone. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5003.0s)]
*  If you are constantly on the move, working, traveling, raising a family, consider checking out Paleo Valley. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5012.0s)]
*  You get clean, high quality nutrition, not the chemical lading garbage so many brands are selling. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5018.0s)]
*  And here's the truth. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5023.0s)]
*  Most of the so-called healthy beef sticks you're going to find a big box stores loaded with preservatives, not Paleo Valley. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5024.0s)]
*  They use old world fermentation methods to keep their sticks fresh without chemicals. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5031.0s)]
*  Paleo Valley beef sticks come in five delicious flavors. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5037.0s)]
*  They went over huge in my house and are made from grass fed beef sourced from regenerative American farms. [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5040.0s)]
*  No MSG, no gluten, no sugar, just real nutrient dense food. [[01:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5048.0s)]
*  Over 55 million beef sticks sold and Paleo Valley stands behind every single one of them with a 60 day money back guarantee. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5052.0s)]

*  Go to paleovalley.com slash Megan and use the code Megan for your order. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5062.0s)]
*  Mike, have you been following closely the first 100 days of the Trump presidency? [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5068.0s)]
*  You know, closely, no, but I've been to D.C. probably half a dozen times since the inauguration. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5073.0s)]
*  In fact, I was there not at the inauguration, but I was there that week. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5079.0s)]
*  And of course, I've been watching and and I've never really seen so many otherwise intelligent pundits and commentators rendered so foolish, really. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5083.0s)]
*  Not because of their take, just because it's obsolete the next day. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5096.0s)]
*  Like whatever it is you think you might know about a thing, just go ahead and put it on a shelf because we're not going to be talking about that tomorrow. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5100.0s)]
*  It's funny you should say that because just yesterday we were doing the show and we were talking about how the news was that Mike Wallace is going to be fired as the national security adviser. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5106.0s)]
*  News Mark Halpern broke, but Politico later claimed that it broke even though there were two and a half hours behind him. [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5114.0s)]
*  And even when told you're being disrespectful to Mark Halpern, who broke this news much earlier than you did, they refused to take down the tweet. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5119.0s)]
*  Totally on brand Politico. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5125.0s)]
*  You do not care what the facts are. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5127.0s)]
*  And even when called out, you refuse to acknowledge them on your massive mistakes. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5129.0s)]
*  In any event, that's how we ended the show yesterday. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5133.0s)]
*  And within like five minutes of closing out the show, it hit that he was indeed being moved out of the position and over to UN ambassador. [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5135.0s)]
*  So it's like the whole story changes in 24 hours is a brand new theme story. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5143.0s)]
*  Marco Rubio filling in now as both, well, permanently for the time being, Secretary of State and National Security adviser. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5147.0s)]
*  And now people are saying he's got the inside line on becoming the next pope. [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5154.0s)]
*  That's the joke. He's he wears so many hats. [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5160.0s)]
*  Right. And that's why not the big one. That's a big hat. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5164.0s)]
*  Yeah, really big. So Marco Rubio's stock is up. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5166.0s)]
*  I don't know whether Mike Walls is stock is up. I don't think it is. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5170.0s)]
*  I think this is Trump being giving him a soft landing someplace. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5173.0s)]
*  There's rumors that this guy, Steve Witkoff, who's been an amazing envoy for Trump negotiating peace in the Middle East, negotiating peace with Russia and Ukraine is probably going to get it. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5177.0s)]
*  I don't know whether that's true. But yeah, to your point, you wait two minutes and the whole news cycle. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5187.0s)]
*  I mean, it's really a question for you. I mean, as somebody who's supposed to be offering analysis, if you don't have time to analyze a thing or if the next thing comes along and trumps the last thing, no pun intended, then then you shift from analysis to just what? [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5193.0s)]
*  Like a travel on on the window on the windowsill. Yeah. [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5208.0s)]
*  It's like a town crier. It's like and and this. Yeah. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5211.0s)]
*  Well, you know, in news, Brigham told me this very early in my career because it's so there's so much volume. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5215.0s)]
*  And I remember being in awe at the reporters and the anchors in particular who could go on the air and just vamp during breaking news. [[01:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5223.0s)]
*  There's no script. There's no prompter. There's no editorial. You're just following, you know, like this plane is down in the Hudson River. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5229.0s)]
*  You know, who's this guy? There are people coming out on the wing. What's happening? [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5235.0s)]
*  How can you do that? How do these anchors do it? And he said, just stay steeped in the news. If you just stay steeped in the news, you'll be fine. And he was so right. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5238.0s)]
*  You even if it's a slow news day, you have to read everything, read all your papers, read all your online favorite sites, because news is so incremental. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5247.0s)]
*  So if you if you have it baked in there and then you just get the next day's tiny developments, I know somehow it stays in there. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5254.0s)]
*  How's this for callback? The same thing is true with fighter pilots and astronauts who need to maintain their tolerance to zero gravity. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5261.0s)]
*  You have to you have to exercise that muscle every day. That Hick maneuver we were talking about. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5270.0s)]
*  It's a very violent, very extravagant thing for the novice to do because your body's not used to doing it. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5277.0s)]
*  But if you build up a tolerance to seven, eight, nine, 10 G's, then you can get there like that. [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5284.0s)]
*  You say you stay steeped in the gravity. Yeah. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5291.0s)]
*  That where you live, eight, nine, 10 G's is crazy on the on the zero gravity flight. It was like one point eight. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5296.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. My friend Matt Hagen drives funny cars. He just went from zero to three hundred and forty miles an hour in under four seconds. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5303.0s)]
*  That's more G's than anything. You know, you know, it has a lot of G's. [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5311.0s)]
*  I don't know what the number is, but you ever go on the Aerosmith ride at Disney? No, it's the best roller coaster ever. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5315.0s)]
*  No, I sit in it. You get like the serious strap in, you know, from the automatic thing that comes down and then you kind of get sucked in. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5322.0s)]
*  You know, you're not going anywhere, which is nice. You feel safer. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5330.0s)]
*  And then instead of the normal roller coaster, which is like click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, click, you know, up the hill, which is actually kind of fun and part of the anticipation. [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5332.0s)]
*  You just take off like a bat out of hell. Yeah. And it's measured in G's. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5340.0s)]
*  There's a thing. My my granddad was an electrical inspector for carnivals and state fairs. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5344.0s)]
*  Oh, wow. Midway. So we got we got endless free passes for all the rides. It was one of the great. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5351.0s)]
*  We do that job. That's the riskiest job ever. You're a walking lawsuit waiting to happen. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5356.0s)]
*  I know. But here's my pop and he didn't care. [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5361.0s)]
*  But I took a fistful of these tickets and there was a ride. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5364.0s)]
*  I think it's illegal now, but it was called the hellhole. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5369.0s)]
*  And what happened is they changed the name of the roundup and they put cages in it. [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5373.0s)]
*  But basically, it's it's imagine a wheel. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5378.0s)]
*  We grew up with that in the 70s. You probably banned that by now. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5381.0s)]
*  You stand there and it spins and spins and spins and then like a centrifuge. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5385.0s)]
*  That's right. And then it turns 90 degrees. Right. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5389.0s)]
*  And you're pinned to the wall. Now, again, as a callback, the vomit. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5392.0s)]
*  That's you're going to the one person vomits and it hovers there and everybody else just flies through it. [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5397.0s)]
*  Oh, my God. And then more. It was truly a vomit comet. [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5403.0s)]
*  Yeah. And when people the most entertaining thing to do at the state fair for me was a kid [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5406.0s)]
*  because I don't get motion sick unless I'm upside down in an F-15. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5412.0s)]
*  But sitting there on a hay bale, watching people walk off the hellhole, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5416.0s)]
*  just brushing other people's vomit off them all day long. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5421.0s)]
*  I mean, look, it's a it's cheap entertainment, but it really left a mark. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5425.0s)]
*  Not everyone can do it. I've been laughing since last June. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5429.0s)]
*  We went to Scandinavia with a fam and we were there for almost two weeks. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5432.0s)]
*  We went to Sweden. We went to a couple of other countries. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5436.0s)]
*  So when we were in, it was Denmark. We went to this amusement park. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5441.0s)]
*  It's pretty famous. And it's reportedly the amusement park that Disneyland was based on. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5446.0s)]
*  Walt Disney went and Covent Gardens. And it's so charming, completely adorable. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5451.0s)]
*  Like you want to move in there. So we went and we got on this roller coaster, [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5456.0s)]
*  which is called the Rootsjebanen, which I believe is roller coaster in Danish. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5461.0s)]
*  And it's it was so tame that it only had the little like bar that comes down to your lap, [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5467.0s)]
*  you know, just like the little silver bar. That's all. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5474.0s)]
*  And so tame that it had an actual man who was about 200 who operated the manual brake while riding it with you. [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5477.0s)]
*  Right. And so tame that the Queen of Denmark, she I think she recently like passed the baton down to her son, [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5485.0s)]
*  who's now the king, but she was riding it like when she was 84 years old. [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5494.0s)]
*  OK, but my husband, Doug, who you know, does get some motion sickness. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5499.0s)]
*  And he didn't throw up, Mike. [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5505.0s)]
*  But you know how you get the pictures after the fact of your roller coaster ride? [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5509.0s)]
*  I took one look at those family pictures and I almost split a side open laughing. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5513.0s)]
*  So I was at a 90 degree angle. I had projectile tears coming out of my eyes. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5520.0s)]
*  I was went over to the guy to move them like whatever you want for it. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5524.0s)]
*  I'll pay it. Name your price for that picture. Doug never lived it down. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5527.0s)]
*  You know why I keep coming back to this? I mean, I really haven't put a lot of thought into it. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5531.0s)]
*  But now that I sit here in the wake of this excellent conversation, [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5536.0s)]
*  contemplating the the fragility, the frailty of the species and the attendant humility therein, [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5539.0s)]
*  it's just when we lose control of the most basic things, [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5546.0s)]
*  whether it's this sphincter or the other one, right, there's just something so relatable. [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5552.0s)]
*  I mean, I know it's gross. I know it's childish. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5560.0s)]
*  I know Dirty Jobs was kind of built on one of those pillars. [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5563.0s)]
*  But it's not just the spectacle of it. [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5568.0s)]
*  It really is a reminder that that that we are still the same like like nausea and diarrhea. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5571.0s)]
*  Dare I say these things reach across the aisle like no other idea. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5578.0s)]
*  Well, you know, again, keeping with the theme of tying it all together. [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5583.0s)]
*  So did Blue Origin. It tied us together right and left. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5586.0s)]
*  I was out there agreeing with Amy Schumer and Olivia. What's her name? Wild. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5590.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. She and I were on the same page. Amazing. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5595.0s)]
*  Like it united the country in mocking their absurdity. [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5598.0s)]
*  It really was something. And also, what a public service they provide. [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5602.0s)]
*  Truly without meaningful meaning to one of the things I love about watching the video of us on our space mission is how much fun you can see the three of us. [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5605.0s)]
*  We had so much fun. It was you levitate. [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5617.0s)]
*  You're lying down on the ground. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5620.0s)]
*  And before you know it, you are look at that. You are levitating up and you can fly. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5622.0s)]
*  You know, it's not like swimming. I thought it would be like swimming and water. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5628.0s)]
*  But there's no resistance. And then you slam to the ground. [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5631.0s)]
*  You slam into somewhat undignified heat. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5635.0s)]
*  Well, that's part of it. Right. [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5638.0s)]
*  I love the bit where Sarah kind of shows her chest, you know, mockingly, making fun of Lauren Sanchez. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5640.0s)]
*  Because what happens right after that is we fall on the ground and you would you can hear in like the raw clip and you pretty much in this one too is me hysterical laughing saying Sarah. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5647.0s)]
*  Because in the moment I knew how funny it was. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5657.0s)]
*  So it's like you're right. You're there's something happening with the three of us up there that is especially fun, joyful, vulnerable in like a very great way because we're mocking others and ourselves and the same like you're all subjected to the same law. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5660.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, that's the beautiful thing about no one sitting there in possession of their faculties. [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5676.0s)]
*  Well, right. But like when you think about gravity, it's just it's such a clarifying truth in a world where you can identify as this or choose your own narrative or choose your own ending. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5681.0s)]
*  It's like gravity doesn't much care if you believe in it or not. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5691.0s)]
*  You lean too far back on that chair. You're going down and no one cares. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5694.0s)]
*  No one cares. Think about how crazy it would have been in that moment when you were on that zero G. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5698.0s)]
*  If you had been the only one who would levitate and everybody else just lay there like into the floor like a butterfly. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5703.0s)]
*  You'd be like, oh, no. Or you'd be like, God, I'm so special. I always knew it. I'm the levitator. [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5710.0s)]
*  You love it. This is separating the wheat from the chaff moments like that galvanize us and bring us together because there's still a few laws to which we're all subject. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5716.0s)]
*  You know, it's this is reminding me and they throw us jelly beans to what you can see. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5726.0s)]
*  This is reminding me for some reason of the story that a woman told about Tucker Carlson, who was on the show this week and a dear friend. [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5729.0s)]
*  I love him. People say the nastiest things about him. They really do. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5735.0s)]
*  But he is just truly one of the best men I absolutely adore. One of the best conversations I've ever had. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5738.0s)]
*  He's a great guy. He's totally misunderstood by the media and probably willingly and the left. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5744.0s)]
*  But there was a great story about him before the before Trump's Republican National Convention speech. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5749.0s)]
*  Tucker spoke out there, as did many folks that you should know. Yeah. [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5756.0s)]
*  And he was backstage with a civilian who had been asked to speak about something. I can't remember who it was. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5761.0s)]
*  Forgive me. But he could tell that she was nervous. She told the story. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5766.0s)]
*  He could tell that she was nervous and he sat down with her and introduced himself and they started chatting and she was talking about how nervous she was. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5770.0s)]
*  And he said, Can we pray about it? And in Tucker's really just kind of coming into his own religiously like he's he hasn't been exactly like a holy roller. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5777.0s)]
*  Forgive the term, but he's coming into it like in full flower right now. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5786.0s)]
*  And so they held he held her hand and they said a prayer together. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5790.0s)]
*  And I just thought like that's there's something so cool about like they're both backstage. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5794.0s)]
*  They're both giving a speech. Even Tucker probably had some nerves because that's a big one. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5799.0s)]
*  And this regular gal whose name we don't know was feeling it overwhelmingly and then sort of like God sends you an angel to remind you like everybody feels this. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5803.0s)]
*  You're not abnormal to feel nervous before a speech like this, but I got you. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5812.0s)]
*  Even if you fall on your face like we're good people, there's they're going to love you even more if you screwed up. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5816.0s)]
*  So two things. First of all, that that moment is happening right now a million times over all around the country. [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5821.0s)]
*  People in a midst of some kind of crisis are being comfort or ministered to in any number of ways by any number of of of others. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5830.0s)]
*  And then there's that moment with a camera pointed at you. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5840.0s)]
*  And that's Heisenberg, right? The act of observing a thing changes a thing in some way. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5846.0s)]
*  The uncertainty principle, I think it's it's called. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5851.0s)]
*  And and so now back to the audience, you know, what are we to make of a moment that is rooted really typically anyway in something that is very private and very personal? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5854.0s)]
*  Are we to think that, OK, this is this is being willingly shared with us, as I think you think. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5868.0s)]
*  And frankly, I do, too. It's like that that's honest and open and kind of brave because you're putting your if you're going to prey on the TV, you're going to take it in the neck from both sides. [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5875.0s)]
*  We know that. But we also know that that can be an artifice, too. [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5883.0s)]
*  That can be pretentious. Anything. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Zo8x1Xxxg&t=5886.0s)]
