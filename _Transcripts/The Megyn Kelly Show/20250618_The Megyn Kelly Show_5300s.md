# Megyn Kelly's FULL Interviews with MK Media Hosts' Link Lauren, Mark Halperin, and Maureen Callahan
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc)
*  Hey everyone, it's Meg and Kelly. Today we are bringing you some MK media highlights that feature [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=0.0s)]
*  my appearances on each of our MK media shows. I'm helping these guys promote their shows [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5.04s)]
*  and we're sort of cross-pollinating and it's been super fun and actually really interesting. For me, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=10.64s)]
*  it's fun to go on their shows and see like what they can do. What kind of an interviewer are they? [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=15.68s)]
*  Something I did not know until they joined the MK media network, which thanks to all of you is just [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=20.64s)]
*  doing so well. I'm super grateful to this audience. I know that you are the ones making these other [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=26.48s)]
*  shows a success and it's just so cool. Just thank you. So the hosts of these shows, turn the tables [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=32.56s)]
*  on yours truly. I was a guest on Spot On with Link Lauren, Next Up with Mark Halpern and The Nerve with [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=40.56s)]
*  Maureen Callahan. Take a look at our fun combos and go ahead and subscribe to their shows on YouTube [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=46.32s)]
*  and on podcasts, wherever you get to your podcasts for free. We'll see you soon. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=52.48s)]
*  Unlike most ranches, Riverbend Ranch never uses growth hormones or antibiotics. They treat their [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=83.36s)]
*  animals humanely and with respect. There are advantages of buying directly from the ranch. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=89.44s)]
*  They can track the health of every animal from the day it is born and can guarantee that it has been [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=94.56s)]
*  healthy every day of its life. Riverbend Ranch has its own state-of-the-art processing facility [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=99.36s)]
*  on the ranch that has received several national awards as one of the best in the U.S. But most [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=105.44s)]
*  importantly is the quality of the beef. They age their beef to perfection for 21 days. You simply [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=110.8s)]
*  cannot buy beef like this in a grocery store. You cannot ship directly from the ranch to your home. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=117.36s)]
*  You get a much better price than going through the middleman. Order directly from riverbendranch.com [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=122.56s)]
*  and use promo code MEGAN to get $20 off your first order. That's riverbendranch.com code MEGAN [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=128.96s)]
*  and be prepared once you taste it. I think you're going to be coming back for more and more. Again, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=136.56s)]
*  riverbendranch.com code MEGAN. Well this next guest really needs no introduction. Like I told you, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=142.4s)]
*  she's an icon. She's a legend. But she looks way too young to be an icon and a legend. We have the [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=150.88s)]
*  one and only host of the Megyn Kelly show, Megyn Kelly herself. She is the reason we are here right [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=156.96s)]
*  now. She is the reason I'm no longer filming videos on my phone with crappy quality. We have [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=163.12s)]
*  a high definition camera. We have a microphone. So Megyn, welcome to the show. We could not be [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=167.6s)]
*  happier to have you. I mean as usual, Link, you are spot on. Thank you for that lovely introduction. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=172.4s)]
*  Thank you for being here. We will skip the pleasantries. I was telling the team, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=179.28s)]
*  we don't need to waste one second of your time. I want to dive into this first topic. There's this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=182.4s)]
*  young 22 year old beautiful abortion rights activist named Olivia Giuliana. She works with [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=187.44s)]
*  the DNC. They really highlighted her during the convention. They had her on camera. She was on [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=193.84s)]
*  stage. She works very closely with the DNC. But she's gone viral the last few days because she is [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=198.64s)]
*  their new secret weapon they're using to reach young men. We have a clip. Let's take a look and [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=203.76s)]
*  then discuss. Don't actually spend time talking to young men. You know this because we know each [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=208.32s)]
*  other in real life. But I spent a lot of time on college campuses and I spent a lot of time with [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=216.88s)]
*  young men. I love young men. I love frat guys. And in that I realized like even the ones that identify [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=221.6s)]
*  as conservative are almost always pro-choice. They're almost always pro-gay marriage. You'd [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=229.84s)]
*  be surprised at the number of them who support a Black Lives Matter. And so I feel like people just [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=235.6s)]
*  kind of lump them into this box when the truth is, again, a lot of them are with us on the issues. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=240.88s)]
*  They're just not part of our coalition because they feel like they're not welcomed in. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=247.68s)]
*  Okay. Megan, we have talked about this for years on the right. Somehow these folks at the DNC have [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=251.35999999999999s)]
*  decided in June of 2025, you know what? Men have left the Democratic Party. They decided to wake up [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=257.52s)]
*  to this fact. Do you think the Democrats are in good hands with this woman at the helm? She says [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=263.68s)]
*  she goes to all these frat houses and young men are fired up about Black Lives Matter. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=268.88000000000005s)]
*  I've never met a young man who is fired up about Black Lives Matter, Megan. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=273.20000000000005s)]
*  I wonder what fraternities these could possibly be. Speaking on behalf of all Syracuse University [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=278.32000000000005s)]
*  graduates, there isn't one there that would be open-minded to Juliana coming in to discuss [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=283.28000000000003s)]
*  her views on abortion and BLM. I mean, this is ridiculous. Is this their answer? [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=288.24s)]
*  As Republicans and right-minded independents, I think we can heave a huge sigh of relief if this [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=292.32000000000005s)]
*  is the solution to their problem. I mean, it's so funny to me that they need to study. They need to [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=297.6s)]
*  study young men to try to figure out how to speak to them. The New York Times had that article where [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  they were saying, we've got to take a hard look at the syntax Republicans are using in dealing with [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=307.76000000000005s)]
*  young men because that's the way into their hearts. Well, why don't you stop saying you don't hire men? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=313.84000000000003s)]
*  We don't have to go all that deep. We don't need $20 million on a focus group. How about removing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=321.92s)]
*  effective sign from outside of all of corporate America that says, we don't hire white and we [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=327.68s)]
*  don't hire white men? That might really open up some avenues for you with voters. I mean, it's just [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  absolutely absurd that they're spending time with this woman. And by the way, not for nothing, no [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=338.8s)]
*  offense to Juliana, but if you really want to make inroads with young college-age men, I think you'd [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=342.88s)]
*  be hiring somebody who could be on one of those commercials for the big hamburgers that used to be [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=347.12s)]
*  on the Super Bowl all the time. You need one of those girls who could have a hose on her [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=353.12s)]
*  while she eats a big cheeseburger. I don't know why it works with the young men. Someone will have [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=357.84000000000003s)]
*  to explain it to me, but I know it does. No, they need someone from a Carl's Jr. Super Bowl [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=362.4s)]
*  commercial. Like I've been saying, it's always... I said this the other day on the show. These [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=368.16s)]
*  abortion activists who are saying, we need more abortion clinics, more Planned Parenthoods. We are [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=373.2s)]
*  pro-choice, pro-choice, pro-choice. They never have any romantic prospects. They look like Chewbacca. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=377.92s)]
*  No one's going near them. So I'm like, I think you're safe being an abortion rights activist. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=383.28000000000003s)]
*  I think you are good. But you brought up this article that we saw last week in the New York [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=387.2s)]
*  Times, $20 million to study how young men speak. Why don't you go sit down and talk to Charlie [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=390.96000000000004s)]
*  Kirk? Why don't you actually talk to young men? I think young men are also tired of apologizing [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=397.76s)]
*  for their masculinity. And in the left, they just don't feel welcome. And you're raising young boys [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=402.88s)]
*  who are becoming men. What advice do you give to your young men as they're going out into the world? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=407.28s)]
*  Because it's such a polarizing environment. Now, if you ask a girl out at the water cooler, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=412.0s)]
*  she could turn around and say, you made me feel uncomfortable, right? It seems like there's this [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=416.23999999999995s)]
*  almost overcorrection now where a lot of guys don't feel comfortable doing anything. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=420.0s)]
*  No, I worry about that environment for them. I mean, they're still young. My kids are young, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=424.71999999999997s)]
*  so they haven't yet had to cross these bridges. But I do worry about that stuff. Like the crazy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=428.23999999999995s)]
*  me too, googly eyed women who think anybody who doesn't ask for permission before they lean in for [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=432.96s)]
*  a kiss is the equivalent of a Harvey Weinstein. I mean, these women are nuts. I mean, I would say [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=437.84s)]
*  to any mother or father of young boys, go on offense. If your son gets any inkling that he's [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=443.28s)]
*  in a me too situation over a nothing burger, like the one I just outlined, you got to go on offense. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=449.76s)]
*  You should send your son first to the Dean to say, I'm being wrongfully disparaged by this woman [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=455.35999999999996s)]
*  saying to her friends on this or on the other thing after a completely consensual activity. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=460.8s)]
*  You know, like I would never let somebody do that to my kid and I don't think anybody should [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=465.12s)]
*  allow it to happen to theirs. I do think that like the part of the huge problem the Democrats [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=469.04s)]
*  have with young men is the wokeism. And it's so it's like the irony of her saying they're pro BLM. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=474.88s)]
*  That's bullshit. But by the way, if they're saying they're pro BLM, they're literally just saying it. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=479.84000000000003s)]
*  They're saying it because they've been told they have to say, okay, I'm pro BLM and have to post [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=485.84s)]
*  the black square on my Instagram or I'm canceled before I even get my first job. So she's too dumb [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=491.2s)]
*  to realize that it's just pro, you know, it's proactive. It's it's it's pro-ful active. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=496.08s)]
*  So secondly, I watch my kids go through this every other week at a non woke school is [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=501.2s)]
*  Women's History Month, African American History Month, Native American History Month, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=508.23999999999995s)]
*  you know, Pride Month. Now we're in like, truly, the kids are like, oh, they don't feel any of [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=512.96s)]
*  these. They don't feel like I'm really super into black history. Now, tell me more about the great [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=519.6800000000001s)]
*  women of America and what they've done. They're like, oh, and it's not just my kids who have, [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=524.8s)]
*  you know, grown up with my husband and me being like that. It's all of them. They're all pretending. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=530.96s)]
*  But these morons in the Democrat Party want to keep pushing it and, you know, study syntax instead. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=536.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. I mean, I would love to see your son bring home a liberal girl with blue hair. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=542.24s)]
*  I would love to see the dinner table if they brought home a liberal. But you also mentioned [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=548.72s)]
*  something. I remember the night you endorsed President Trump, and we don't have a clip. I'm [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=552.4s)]
*  just thinking about this now. The night you endorsed President Trump, I remember you turned around [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=555.44s)]
*  to the guys in hard hats and you said, what kind of society can we have? How as women can we feel [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=559.36s)]
*  protected if our men are being beaten down and they're not being taken care of? And I thought [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=564.48s)]
*  that really encapsulated this issue with the Democratic Party right now. I think a lot of these [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=569.04s)]
*  guys, they're tired of seeing their girlfriends, their daughters, their wives having their [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=573.92s)]
*  bathrooms infiltrated or their sports teams infiltrated. You look at someone like Peyton [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=578.7199999999999s)]
*  McNabb, right? They are tired of seeing their girls getting beat up. And it's why they're leaving the [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=582.8s)]
*  Democratic Party because they're tired of the nonsense. Don't you think that's a part of it, [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=587.36s)]
*  that they have this desire to protect the homeland, to protect the women in their lives, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=591.12s)]
*  the guys who have balls? Yes. You know what? Last night, my kids are now on summer vacation, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=595.2s)]
*  so we stayed up late on a Sunday night. We were watching Zero Dark Thirty. Remember the movie? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=601.0400000000001s)]
*  Oh, I love that movie. Yes. It was Jessica Chastain. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=605.6s)]
*  Yeah. That shows how they caught Bin Laden. And it was, you look at them, yes, it completely shows [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=608.48s)]
*  what a hero in this still unnamed CIA agent was, the female agent. So that's great. But like those [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=614.96s)]
*  badasses at the end when you've got like the Navy sails getting on board, those Black Hawk helicopters, [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=620.8000000000001s)]
*  they weren't Black Hawks, but they were stealth helicopters to go to Abbottabad. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=625.6800000000001s)]
*  That's like badass, amazing, hot masculinity at its finest, right? Those are men. And every man [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=629.76s)]
*  has that peace in him, that sort of the protector, fighter, don't F with me or my family or my country [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=641.36s)]
*  mentality. It gets beaten out of them by a woke, submissive, weird left that's decided to just, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=650.16s)]
*  that it's not attractive to be a true man anymore. And I mean, no woman wants that. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=659.12s)]
*  No even gay man wants that, right? It's like we miss our real men. So I think, right, like it's [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=664.16s)]
*  like, I don't know. I feel like the more we encourage what's a natural instinct in virtually [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=670.4s)]
*  every single man alive, which is to be a protector, to be a fierce protector and a warrior, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=677.84s)]
*  the better off we'll be, the better off the Democrat party would be. But they've lost the [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=682.56s)]
*  ability to connect with that at all. Their entire thing is the weird Birkenstock wearing man bun, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=686.4s)]
*  MERS wearing guy who's super effeminate and in touch with his feelings, which is not attractive. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=692.0s)]
*  And it's not attractive to be. Not only it doesn't attract the opposite sex, it doesn't attract [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=698.8s)]
*  men to the party because they don't want to associate with that. It's incongruous [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=703.92s)]
*  with their own God given instincts. Absolutely. No, I think these men are just tired of [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=708.8s)]
*  apologizing. Their masculinity is toxic. If they try to explain something, they're mansplaining. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=713.76s)]
*  If they're sitting comfortably, they're man spreading. There's always just this negative [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=718.88s)]
*  lean to everything on the left. But speaking of a man who's also been beaten down into a show, [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=722.72s)]
*  we have to move on to Prince Harry, the Duke of White Castle, the Duke of Waffle House, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=728.1600000000001s)]
*  he and Meghan Markle, the wannabe Duchess, the Duchess of sun damage. She's back in the news [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=733.2s)]
*  today because there's some new articles out. I just wanted to run through some of them quickly [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=738.8000000000001s)]
*  because we had a real deep top of the show with the horrific violence yesterday in Boulder. We [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=742.08s)]
*  just wanted to have some fun with you and discuss Harry and Meghan. So there's this article that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=747.0400000000001s)]
*  came out that Meghan Markle really did expect Harry to be a billionaire when she met him. She [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=750.72s)]
*  was incredibly disappointed to find out he's only worth a couple million and she's going to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=756.08s)]
*  have to actually work and hawk these jams and jellies and dog biscuits to have the lifestyle [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=760.24s)]
*  that she wants. I personally think, and I'd love to get your take on this. I think Meghan would [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=765.12s)]
*  leave Harry in a second if a billionaire would scoop her up. I think she'd be in divorce court [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=769.6s)]
*  tomorrow if like an Elon wanted to take her out. But I don't think a lot of billionaires want [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=774.32s)]
*  a 45, 46 year old Duchess with multiple marriages and all that baggage. Meghan, what do you think? [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=779.0400000000001s)]
*  I completely agree. And by the way, she's already gotten the benefit of her bargain with Harry [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=784.88s)]
*  because she got the title. That's what she wanted. She wanted to be world famous. She wanted the [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=789.84s)]
*  title. You remember when Harry was single, he was the elephant that he was the one, the most [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=793.6s)]
*  eligible bachelor on earth. You could be a royal, you could become world famous overnight. You could [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=797.84s)]
*  live in a castle. You could have access to the crown jewels. You would be a princess. My God, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=804.96s)]
*  yes, he could have had his pick except for the people who weren't PR horse because like his [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=809.84s)]
*  prior girlfriends broke up with him, at least the last two reportedly, because they did not want [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=815.76s)]
*  this lifestyle. They actually didn't want to be famous. They wanted like a normal life where they [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=820.4s)]
*  could just fall in love for real and raise a family. But this woman is nothing but a publicity whore. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=824.1600000000001s)]
*  It's a term of art. And she, I, you know, we broke the news that she had Prince Harry on her [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=829.6s)]
*  vision board when she was younger and that was her goal, hashtag goal to marry Prince Harry. So [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=836.88s)]
*  it was all about getting the title. She's done that now. Now she's just stuck with this depressed [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=843.6s)]
*  ginger who has absolutely no family, no friends and no money. This was not hashtag part of the plan. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=848.4s)]
*  So what is she supposed to do now? Now, if she's smart and she is that she's very savvy, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=854.4s)]
*  she will find a way to bounce past him to some other taker who might actually just love the guy. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=859.36s)]
*  She will take her royal kids who can still go by Prince and Princess and find the billionaire, [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=865.12s)]
*  like you say, who actually will just keep her in the manner to which you'd like to become accustomed. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=870.4000000000001s)]
*  But as you point out, it gets trickier because these billionaires can sense one thing. When [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=873.7600000000001s)]
*  you're not looking for a partner, you're looking for a solution. And that's obviously the lane that [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=877.9200000000001s)]
*  Meghan Markle's in now. She doesn't make really her own money. This whole Netflix thing is just [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=882.5600000000001s)]
*  a ruse. We all know this is made up just to give her something to do. Her miraculous renewal for [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=886.72s)]
*  her second season, which was already shot in full by the time the first season was done, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=892.88s)]
*  meaning they just made some extra episodes and decided to roll out a fake second season as a PR [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=897.6s)]
*  plan, hasn't fooled anybody. Now they're saying they're not even sure if she's going to make more [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=902.64s)]
*  jam. That thing's already dwindling on the vine. Everything she touches turns to shit. And I think [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=907.12s)]
*  every sort of creative person behind her or deep pocket behind her knows it's an extraordinary [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=912.96s)]
*  risk. She's too toxic to touch. Absolutely. So speaking of the reality show, the cooking show, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=919.36s)]
*  I saw the same story. She's already tired of selling the jams and jelly. She's like, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=927.6s)]
*  well, we might restock in 2026. I think there's no demand. I also think she's lazy. I don't think [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=931.44s)]
*  she wants to work. She should actually run for Congress as a Democrat like Jasmine Crockett, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=937.44s)]
*  because they don't want to work. They want to twerk and sit around and film videos. So I think [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=941.6800000000001s)]
*  she should actually run for office because Meghan Markle, you're lazy. So we also have a clip [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=945.52s)]
*  from her reality show. She posted a deleted scene where she's showing some bizarre pineapple hack. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=950.4s)]
*  Let's take a look and then talk about it. Trick that people do with pineapple instead of just [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=957.04s)]
*  cutting it to make the perfect little bite. You follow the wedge when nature has given you all [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=962.24s)]
*  the cues on how to have a perfect taste of something. How fun is that? I love it. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=968.64s)]
*  This woman is being paid millions of dollars to show how to cut into a pineapple. Also, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=972.72s)]
*  I thought the pineapple was the international symbol for swingers. I think maybe she was [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=981.28s)]
*  symbolizing she's down to party, down to have some fun. Are you taking cooking advice from Meghan [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=985.44s)]
*  Markle in the kitchen? Oh my God. I mean, let me tell you this. First of all, there's a reason [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=990.48s)]
*  that was deleted. She really should go with her producer's instincts. Okay. Second of all, [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=995.6s)]
*  who the hell is sated by one tiny little bite of pineapple? The reason we cut it the way we do is [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1000.4s)]
*  because you eat it almost like a watermelon or at least half a watermelon slice. It's very sweet, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1007.04s)]
*  but you want a little more, just one little bite. That's like having one little handful of popcorn. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1011.4399999999999s)]
*  It's impossible. Nobody wants to do it that way. Once again, proving how unrelatable she is. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1015.68s)]
*  No, I wouldn't take any of the advice on her show. Maureen, as you know, Callahan and I tried to [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1021.04s)]
*  recreate this thing. And the only thing that was good that she actually did was the one pot pasta, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1025.76s)]
*  which she very clearly stole word for word from Martha Stewart. And unbeknownst to me, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1032.48s)]
*  because I don't cook, this is apparently one of Martha Stewart's famous recipes. So she wasn't [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1039.36s)]
*  even clever in her apparent thievery. She just stole it, relabeled it her own, and then tried to [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1044.0s)]
*  act like she'd come up with this cool one pot chicken thing. After that, it was just taking [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1049.92s)]
*  pretzels from one bag and pouring them into another. And by the way, I have a never before [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1054.24s)]
*  heard secret about her show and our recreation of the show. She decided to make microwave popcorn [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1059.84s)]
*  by putting an ear of corn into the microwave and magically it popped perfectly. And then she put [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1067.1200000000001s)]
*  those kernels into a little bag. Oh, so cute. And I remember watching this thinking there's no way [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1072.32s)]
*  that actually works. But then when we did it, my producer gave me a little ear of corn. We put it [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1077.2s)]
*  in there and it worked perfectly. I'm like, my God, maybe this is the thing. No, you know what? [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1081.84s)]
*  It's a thing. They take these little ears of corn and they treat them with chemicals [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1086.48s)]
*  that make them pop perfectly. So now you've got chemical laden popcorn. You could have just gone [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1090.9599999999998s)]
*  with Orville Redenbacher, who already did all this work for you without trying to pretend that [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1097.6799999999998s)]
*  you're making homemade popcorn at home. No, everything is a lie. Also, don't tell [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1101.76s)]
*  Michelle Obama that you don't cook. You might be in good company. So they're telling me we have two [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1107.36s)]
*  minutes. I want to get to one last woman who is also insufferable and she's in the news right now. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1112.4799999999998s)]
*  That is Taylor Swift. So Taylor Swift bought her masters back for $300 million. We're happy. She [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1117.6799999999998s)]
*  has her music back. If you're not in the weeds in the music industry, no one cares that much. But [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1123.76s)]
*  we had this discussion last night, my team, do we think Taylor Swift's clout is down, right? She [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1129.28s)]
*  lost all her awards at the Grammys, every American Music Award. She also endorsed Kamala Harris. That [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1134.16s)]
*  went terribly for her. Do you think this is her low moment? Is she down in the weeds, Megan? Is Taylor [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1139.6000000000001s)]
*  Swift kind of over? Yeah, I think she is. And she did it to herself. She got political. There was no [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1144.4s)]
*  reason for it. You look around at the Hollywood actresses and the movie stars and the singers who [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1150.72s)]
*  choose not to get political and they're either very smart Democrats or they're Republicans, right? [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1156.5600000000002s)]
*  Because Republicans know they can't come out with their politics because they'll get loathed and [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1163.04s)]
*  canceled by their industry. And very smart Democrats know, as the Michael Jordan rule says it, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1167.52s)]
*  Republicans buy sneakers too and Democrats buy sneakers too. And why would you alienate half [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1172.48s)]
*  your fan base? It's not worth it. I was recently told, for example, Renee Zellweger keeps her [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1176.8s)]
*  politics very quiet for a reason. She's from Texas. You can figure it out from there. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1184.96s)]
*  But Taylor Swift thought she was too big for the rules to apply to her. And as it turns out, [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1192.08s)]
*  she's subject to the rules of gravity, just like every other human on earth, no matter how much she [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1197.6s)]
*  can fool 14 year old girls into thinking she's some sort of a role model, even though her entire [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1203.6799999999998s)]
*  history is getting dumped by a series of men and not to land into a marriage or a family by the [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1208.7199999999998s)]
*  time she's in her mid to late thirties. So Taylor Swift thought the rules didn't apply to her and [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1215.4399999999998s)]
*  that she could get political, that she could not only get political and endorse Kamala, but actually [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1220.32s)]
*  tell the world that the reason she was endorsing him is because of tampon Tim Walsh and their weird [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1225.04s)]

*  it's over. And now she's coming to grips with the reality that her opinion politically means nothing. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1266.8000000000002s)]
*  No one gives a shit. She might be able to sing the occasional cute little bubbly song that's [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1273.76s)]
*  meaningful to a teenager, just like Oprah might be able to fool somebody in her seventies that she's [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1279.44s)]
*  still as relevant as she was in the nineties. But regular people know these are not people we should [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1284.64s)]
*  be listening to for advice or their talk shows or frankly, let's face it with Taylor, her music either. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1289.6000000000001s)]
*  Hallelujah. I couldn't have said it better myself. I think Taylor Swift sort of 2015 girl boss [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1296.4s)]
*  feminism. She hasn't realized the culture has moved on. If she really wants to protect women, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1302.96s)]
*  it's not Kamala Harris. It's President Trump who's trying to get men out of women's sports [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1307.76s)]
*  and secure the border so we don't have another Lake and Riley or Jocelyn and Gary. I think if [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1311.6000000000001s)]
*  Taylor Swift really had some gumption, she would have come out on the right side of history. But [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1315.6000000000001s)]
*  it's why she got her ass handed to her. So I'm on your show tomorrow. Maybe we can break down some [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1319.44s)]
*  more of this, but we are so grateful to have you. I could not be more grateful. I was telling everyone [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1324.24s)]
*  this is an A list booking. Oh my God, we have Megan Kelly coming on the show. This is a big [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1329.28s)]

*  This administration is working very hard to try and fix this country. But while they're focused [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1352.08s)]
*  on fixing the country, they can't fix your personal finances. That's really up to you. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1363.1999999999998s)]
*  And that's why thousands of Americans are turning to birch gold. In the past 12 months, the value of [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1368.96s)]
*  gold has risen by 30%. Think about that. How's your stock market investment doing? As a [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1374.08s)]

*  these uncertain times, it does the same. Birch gold makes it incredibly easy to convert your [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1400.3200000000002s)]

*  the fairy godmother of MK media. And when I say fairy godmother, I mean godmother like Marlon [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1438.72s)]
*  Brando, godfather. Tough but fair. Megan Kelly, welcome to Next Up. The pleasure's all mine. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1443.92s)]
*  Thanks for having me. I'm going to take the opportunity to in public do what I've done in [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1450.48s)]
*  private, which is thank you for bringing me on to be part of this. Why does the world now have [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1455.84s)]
*  the MK media network? Oh, I mean, the honor is mine, Mark. I'm thrilled to be in partnership with you. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1461.6s)]
*  You know, it was one of those things where the show was doing very well and we were thrilled with that, [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1467.4399999999998s)]
*  but I had so many stars coming on regularly who I absolutely loved hearing from. And I thought [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1472.1599999999999s)]
*  it'd be great to help them get out there more. And we've kind of figured out how to market the show, [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1477.36s)]
*  how to get clips out, how to make sure the show gets the attention that it deserves, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1482.32s)]
*  and then the audience will decide whether they like the content that we started discussing [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1486.24s)]
*  internally. How can we help our favorites do the same thing? And that's where you came in. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1490.32s)]
*  All right. Well, again, very grateful to you. And to the extent we're off to a fast start, [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1495.28s)]
*  I would attribute it at a very high percentage to you and your colleagues who have [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1499.52s)]
*  showed us how to do it. So thank you. Halpern's rule of interviewing, I try to ask the people [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1503.04s)]
*  questions they've never been asked before, at least not in public. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1508.6399999999999s)]
*  So let's see how I do. I know it's going to be tough, but I think I might be able to do it. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1511.76s)]
*  First of all, I find that the people who are the most successful on camera are great broadcasters, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1517.92s)]
*  as you are, but also great television producers. Tell me what you know about how to be a great [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1525.3600000000001s)]
*  television producer. What are the hallmarks of being a great TV producer? Well, I mean, [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1530.0800000000002s)]
*  there's so many, but I will say, number one, I do think, and this is kind of a compliment to [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1535.04s)]
*  both myself and you, I think I'm a very good spotter of talent. I think I have, I don't know [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1540.56s)]
*  if it's all those years I spent with Roger under his wing or what, but I definitely have an eye [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1547.36s)]
*  for who will work and resonate with an audience and who will not. And I've almost never been wrong [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1551.52s)]
*  on that. So that's good. That's good news for you too. I think, you know, one of my main things is, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1556.32s)]
*  I talk about my show as follows. It's like cool water over a hot brain. I want the audience to [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1562.96s)]
*  never have to work for it. I want it to be seamless. It comes into their brain effortlessly. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1569.44s)]
*  They walk away understanding it without ever having had to try to hit the 15 second rewind [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1574.4s)]
*  to stop and say to the husband or wife, what was that? To define any small term that may even [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1579.92s)]
*  arguably be confusing and the audience, if they know it, will forgive you that, you know, five [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1586.48s)]
*  second explanation. And if they don't, they'll be forever grateful to you for not assuming they did. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1591.3600000000001s)]
*  I've got pet peeves that are weird. Like I don't really like running sound bites more [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1596.3200000000002s)]
*  longer than 60 seconds. I hate when people put graphics on the screen that don't match [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1600.64s)]
*  what the anchor is saying. It is the most annoying thing in broadcasting. Like don't pop up some [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1608.24s)]
*  tweet somebody said or posted while the anchor speaking. The brain doesn't know what to do. Do [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1614.5600000000002s)]
*  I listen to this anchor? Do I read with my eyes what this post is? Little things like that, [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1620.88s)]
*  that have just come to me over the years that I think help give the audience a pleasant experience [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1625.5200000000002s)]
*  while they're watching the show, whether they know it or not. And then conversely, people who [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1631.6000000000001s)]
*  don't do these things are giving the audience an unpleasant experience and the audience doesn't [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1635.2800000000002s)]
*  really actively know why. They just know I don't enjoy it and they don't come back. Spoken like a [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1639.92s)]
*  great TV producer. All right. Believe it or not, we're 48, only 48 hours past your interview with [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1644.8000000000002s)]
*  Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson and the release of their book. One of the things I tell anchors who [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1650.72s)]
*  I work with or young people who want to be in TV, a list of questions is not a strategy. If you're [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1656.32s)]
*  doing an interview, you need a strategy. What was your strategy when you were interviewing Jake Tapper [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1661.76s)]
*  and Alex Thompson? Well, I did go back and forth on how should I start it? Should I start it by [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1666.96s)]
*  getting into the facts of the book or should I start it by really pushing him on whether he's [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1671.52s)]
*  the right messenger? And in the end, it just didn't feel like I knew I had to get to pushing [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1676.24s)]
*  him on whether he's the right messenger. That could not be sacrificed. We only had 40, well, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1682.56s)]
*  we had one hour plus 14 minutes with him, one hour with some breaks plus 14 minutes. And so I just, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1687.76s)]
*  it was, that was the priority. Get to that. And then whatever time we had left, I would do the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1693.52s)]
*  substance of the book in. And so that made sense to me. And then there was a question of how hard [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1697.92s)]
*  should I push him? Because we are friends, friends. We're not like tight friends, but we're [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1702.96s)]
*  friends. We've been friendly, I guess is a better way of saying it for some 15 years now. I've never [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1707.3600000000001s)]
*  done anything social with Jake, but we like each other. So it was kind of awkward. I think he knew [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1711.76s)]
*  because in the booking process, he and I had been in touch that I was going to push him. And he told [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1719.44s)]
*  me before the interview, he wanted that because he wanted to answer the tough questions for all of [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1725.1200000000001s)]
*  his skeptics. So I felt like we were on a good ground to really, for me to go for it. Maybe, [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1729.44s)]
*  maybe it was like an eight and a half when he thought it might be a six and a half. I'm not [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1734.96s)]
*  sure. We, I think we're fine, but you know how it is. It's like, you have to go with the flow when [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1738.56s)]
*  the person comes on and see if they're pushing back, if they're giving it up, you know, if he [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1743.04s)]
*  had rolled over more right at the top, it wouldn't have been as contentious as it got. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1746.56s)]
*  Right. We were going to play a two minute soundbite from the interview, but I'm told anything longer [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1751.3600000000001s)]
*  than a minute's a bad idea. So we won't. I mean, to be honest, I do make exceptions. It depends. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1755.04s)]
*  All right. Maybe we'll roll in some here two minutes or so. [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1760.08s)]
*  If we're going to do this, let's just stick to the facts here. Okay. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1766.48s)]
*  When there is a damaging report, that's what I've been doing all along. I'm talking about what you [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1771.04s)]
*  just didn't miss the biggest story of the century when it comes to presidential politics. And one of [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1776.0s)]
*  us did. If you hadn't done the interview and Jake, as your friend called you afterwards and said, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1781.76s)]
*  Hey, how'd I do with that interviewer? How would you say Jake did in his interview with you? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1788.16s)]
*  Well, I'll be totally honest. I thought he could have done better. Jake, when he's more relaxed is [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1793.6s)]
*  much more conversational. And I thought in our interview, he sounded almost affected a bit, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1802.24s)]
*  almost like he was trying to be professorial and maintain his cool. And he kept repeating that [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1808.96s)]
*  thing. I look back at my coverage with humility, which sounded PR tested and not really authentic. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1814.0s)]
*  There's a reason it sounded PR tested. Yeah, I know. And I just think that's the problem. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1820.8799999999999s)]
*  It's not just Jake's problem. It's a problem with a lot of people who are stuck in the cable news [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1827.04s)]
*  universe, which is they're not their authentic selves when they're on camera. Jake is actually [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1830.1599999999999s)]
*  a pretty relaxed guy in your personal interactions with him. I do like him. It's just on camera. Not [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1836.72s)]
*  everybody can do it. And when they're feeling on their heels, not everybody can do it. He would [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1843.52s)]
*  have been much better served by just completely owning, I'm embarrassed right up top and putting [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1848.8s)]
*  it in his own words so he could really fill it out and convince people of it. How convincing do [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1853.6000000000001s)]
*  you find his argument that he acknowledges he missed the story, but that there was no way for [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1858.4s)]
*  him to actually get the story? I don't believe it. I don't believe that. I think he did have the [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1864.0s)]
*  sources. And I just think everyone went along because they liked the lie. They were perfectly [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1870.64s)]
*  happy with the lie. Jake is articulating it perfectly now about how Trump was viewed as an [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1875.52s)]
*  existential threat. And when that's how you see your opponent, any many means are justified, [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1882.08s)]
*  except he's still not admitting he was part of that. And that he talked about how he didn't see [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1887.44s)]
*  what Laura Trump saw, what I saw, what you saw. And one question I wish I had asked him was, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1891.6s)]
*  why not? Have you spent any time trying to figure out why you didn't see it? Because I would submit, [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1899.12s)]
*  he's not a Trump fan and it colored his judgment and it's probably still coloring his judgment [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1905.6799999999998s)]
*  right now. Yeah. I mean, again, you and I single out Jake because he wrote the book, but what we're [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1910.6399999999999s)]
*  saying about him is true of thousands of people literally that you and I know in newsrooms across [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1915.4399999999998s)]
*  the country, Senator Cotton is going to be here later. He put out a video in 2020 saying, showing [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1920.48s)]
*  Joe Biden's loss of mental capacity and saying, this is a real danger to the country. And I just [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1927.3600000000001s)]
*  think they can't answer the question. How can you say you didn't see it? Not were you in private [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1932.8s)]
*  meetings or off camera during an interview, but just watching the public performance of Joe Biden [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1938.32s)]
*  in the 2020 campaign, I just don't see how they can say they missed it or they didn't see it or [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  they didn't have the sources. It was right there. Well, this is one of the things I like about you, [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1951.12s)]
*  Mark is you are able to report on both sides objectively, no matter what your personal [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1956.08s)]
*  preferences. And I feel like I can do that too. Obviously I'm a Trump supporter. I endorsed the [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1962.48s)]
*  man and spoke at his rally, but I can still hit him. I can see when he does things that are [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1968.08s)]
*  controversial. He didn't speak to me for eight months in 2023 because I did raise some comments [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1972.96s)]
*  about Trump. He kept calling Biden Obama and was making references to World War III. And I pointed [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1979.68s)]
*  out he didn't like that. If you're doing your job right, they are going to dislike you, these [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1985.68s)]
*  politicians, even if you happen to support them politically. But more reporters need to be able [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1991.92s)]
*  to separate their personal preferences from their reporting responsibility. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=1997.2s)]
*  All right. This next topic could take two hours, but we don't have it. So I'll ask it briefly and [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2002.48s)]
*  you can weigh in a little bit, but I know you have a lot of, I'm pretty sure have a lot of thoughts [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2007.3600000000001s)]
*  on this. You mentioned before authenticity and how we look at our friends who are not unshackled as [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2011.1200000000001s)]
*  we are. They're not an independent media and they're not their authentic selves on camera [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2016.0800000000002s)]
*  or in their writing. Why not? Why can't they be unshackled on cable news or on broadcast television [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2020.5600000000002s)]
*  news? What is it that keeps them from doing what you and I are able to do now so freely? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2027.36s)]
*  Well, I think there's many answers to that. One is if you, most of these people are Ivy League, [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2033.12s)]
*  elite institution educated folks who they've had a lifetime of good approval and coloring within the [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2038.24s)]
*  lines and making it in the proper spaces. And so that cultivates a certain, I don't know, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2044.8799999999999s)]
*  you know, unwillingness to show vulnerability. They're only used to getting perfect A's and [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2051.84s)]
*  pat it on the head. Playing by the rules. Yeah. It takes a fair amount of courage, frankly, to get [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2059.2000000000003s)]
*  rid of that veneer. Many did not come up under somebody like Ailes who saw that in me, even [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2065.1200000000003s)]
*  though I'm not an elite institution person early on, but I was trying to be a perfectionist saying [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2070.56s)]
*  that doesn't work on television and the audience can smell a phony from a mile away. And so I was [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2076.6400000000003s)]
*  given permission by my boss to let my guard down and I did. But even then, I think people would say [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2081.12s)]
*  that you could see a big difference between me today and me while I was on Fox. There's some [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2087.12s)]
*  constraints in the cable news universe on just how much of yourself you can and should show. The whole [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2092.08s)]
*  system's set up to be supportive of the platform, not exactly the anchor. And the discussions are so [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2097.68s)]
*  clipped and surface level and cable. You don't have two hours to sit there and just meander and [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2104.64s)]
*  think aloud and have a funny moment and drop a swear if it's authentic to you. It's like [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2112.0s)]
*  the whole system's set up to keep you in a box. Yep. And so many of them, and you see this everywhere, [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2117.84s)]
*  they're just reading the prompter and they're waiting for the break and then they're waiting [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2123.12s)]
*  for the next break and then they're waiting for the show to end so they can leave. There's no sense [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2126.24s)]
*  of I'm so excited to be here with my audience. I'm so excited to talk to you. And that's true of [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2129.68s)]
*  younger anchors and reporters, but it's true of some of the very experienced people. They don't [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2135.3599999999997s)]
*  seem to be actually in the moment enjoying what they're doing. And so it seems inauthentic. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2139.9199999999996s)]
*  It's true. And not just that, but Britt Hume used to say to me, there are a lot of news actresses [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2144.7999999999997s)]
*  in this business. You're not one of them. But it's true for men too. There are news actors too. These [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2150.64s)]
*  are like people who are failed Hollywood wannabes who settled for TV so they could see their mugs on [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2156.88s)]
*  television and feel important. And they're not excited to be there. They just want to be a star. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2163.04s)]
*  So for them, it's about a performance as opposed to, oh my gosh, I'm excited about the news. I [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2167.36s)]
*  can't wait to talk to you about the news, which I think is closer to how you feel about it. And [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2173.04s)]
*  me too. Either I'm excited about it or I need the show as my therapy. It's a catharsis to set the [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2177.6800000000003s)]
*  record straight on what's out there. Right. So you mentioned Britt. I had the honor of sitting [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2183.44s)]
*  next to Britt in the ABC News White House booth for the first year or so of the Clinton administration. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2187.84s)]
*  And Britt is one of the, I'd say the top five people I learned from about broadcast television, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2193.2000000000003s)]
*  how to be a broadcaster, but also how to navigate the complexities of working with 200 people to [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2198.16s)]
*  get a story on the air. I'll tell you my favorite Britt story. Britt used to work for the investigative [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2204.08s)]
*  columnist, Jack Anderson. And he said, Jack Anderson told him that when you called someone's [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2209.52s)]
*  phone, to call someone on the phone to try to get an interview with them. And they, back then you [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2214.08s)]
*  had to call someone's landline and assistant would answer and the assistant would say, may I tell Mr. [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2220.08s)]
*  So-and-so what it's in reference to? Britt said, Jack Anderson time to say, Malfe decents. And he [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2225.28s)]
*  said, they always called back. I learned a lot from Britt, including humor. And that's what I want to [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2230.4s)]
*  ask you about next, because I study successful broadcasters and I think about what are the [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2236.08s)]
*  elements of their brand? What is it that people find appealing? And I listen to what people say [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2240.3199999999997s)]
*  they find appealing about you. You're interesting, you're honest, you're authentic. You have a great [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2245.04s)]
*  nose for news. You know where the interesting stuff is, but you're hilarious. Okay. Your show is so [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2249.2799999999997s)]
*  funny. You are so funny. And so first I'm wondering what your comedy inspirations are, either people [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2255.92s)]
*  in news or they're comedians you like who style you maybe emulate or think about and animate you? [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2263.2s)]
*  That's very nice of you to say. Thank you. I would say no, there's, I mean, I love comedy [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2271.68s)]
*  and I love comedians, but there's nobody I style myself after. I would just say I come from a long [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2278.3199999999997s)]
*  line of funny people. They come by it naturally. And maybe some small percentage of that has rubbed [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2282.3999999999996s)]
*  off of me. My Nana was hilarious. My mom is very funny. My brother's hysterical. And it was just, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2288.48s)]
*  you know, it's like one of those Irish Catholic things where you sit around the kitchen table [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2293.76s)]
*  and you just mock each other mercilessly for your whole life. So it comes naturally. And the news [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2297.04s)]
*  is just so ripe for humor. If you can keep that arms distance between yourself and it, then, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2302.48s)]
*  you know, it's one of those many days of laugh or cry things, but I don't think I would enjoy the [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2309.36s)]
*  news anywhere as much as I do if I couldn't laugh at the absurdity of it. And I think that's one of [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2313.52s)]
*  the things that's helped me over the years. I remember one time the New York Times was doing [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2318.56s)]
*  a profile on my show when I was at Fox in prime time. And I gave her a quote at the end of the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2322.56s)]
*  show saying something like, we talked about ISIS and men in cages. I mean, it was the worst of the [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2327.84s)]
*  ISIS times and we had a lot of laughs. And somehow, you know, we were able to do that in our 42 minutes [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2333.28s)]
*  of content on the air here and there. And now I, you know, here I try to do the same, you know, [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2338.56s)]
*  you got to keep laughing. All right. If you think about it, not current day comedians, but like [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2342.88s)]
*  Lucille Ball, Joan Rivers, Ernie Kovacs, who's like a classic comedian whose style and- [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2347.04s)]
*  I love Joan Rivers. I absolutely adore Joan Rivers. I know there's so many. I mean, Andrew [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2352.64s)]
*  Schultz right now is so funny. He's so raunchy, but hilarious. I absolutely love him. Tim Dillon's [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2358.08s)]
*  hysterical. You know, I love Sebastian Maniscalco. Jim Brewer, he's so good. I like, you know, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2365.04s)]
*  I like a little raunchy, a little off color for sure. There've been a lot. I love the comedy seller. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2372.32s)]
*  I go there. Noam's a great guy. So more of that, the better. And just grew up watching those, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2377.92s)]
*  you know, like MASH. We watched that all the time. The Jeffersons, all these classic comedies that [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2383.92s)]
*  were on in our house growing up. Growing up and when you started in news, do you consider [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2388.4s)]
*  yourself to be a funny person? I wouldn't go that far. I would say I have a very healthy sense of [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2394.88s)]
*  humor, but I don't really think I'm actively funny. I mean, I'm good for a laugh here or there. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2401.92s)]
*  I'm going to build a clip reel of your funniest moments from the last two weeks and I think I'll [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2407.1200000000003s)]
*  be able to make the compelling case that you are a very funny person. All right. When you think [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2410.8s)]
*  about just broadcasting skills, who have you learned from? Who is either by example or instruction, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2414.6400000000003s)]
*  who has taught you how to be a great broadcaster? Well, I would definitely say Brits been a huge [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2421.2s)]
*  influence. Same as you point out. He taught me the nuts and bolts of being a good reporter and being [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2425.9199999999996s)]
*  relentlessly factual and upgrading your information, keeping it tight, all of that. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2431.6s)]
*  And just never stop questioning the lines in your report. Can they be better? Can they be tighter? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2436.64s)]
*  Can they be more right than they are right now? And his wife, Kim too, is a mentor. Brits, one of [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2440.64s)]
*  the best TV script writers in the history of the medium. Yeah. And merciless in a great way. That's [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2446.56s)]
*  what I hope my team would say about me. I'm merciless in a great way too, I think, because [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2452.56s)]
*  I don't let up on them. We're working on this AM Update show, which we do every day, and my poor [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2456.24s)]
*  producer, I love her. She's great, but I'm just relentless on her. Like, no, no, no, we can upgrade. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2460.7999999999997s)]
*  We can do better. But it's toward service of the audience. That's how Brit was. In terms of role [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2465.36s)]
*  models, there's nobody better in my view. Like, there's the person I admired most. He's no longer [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2471.28s)]
*  with us, but by far was Mike Wallace. I just thought, that's it right there. That's how it [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2477.1200000000003s)]
*  should be done with charisma and fortitude and the willingness to challenge anybody, but in a way where [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2484.0800000000004s)]
*  you could get away with it. You know, like, you didn't have to emerge with a jugular, but you kind [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2492.0800000000004s)]
*  of did. But still, there was a gentlemanly dynamic between Wallace and most of his guests, which I [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2496.8s)]
*  admired. It's very, very tricky. So I really loved him. Did you spend time with him, or that's just studying him on camera? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2502.32s)]
*  Just studying him. I didn't. I mean, I know his son, Chris Wallace, fairly well, or did when I was at [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2507.92s)]
*  Fox, but loved him. When I was very young, I loved Oprah, and the young Oprah was great. She was a great, [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2512.0800000000004s)]
*  great, great interviewer. That was before she got completely drunk on her own wine, became hard [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2517.6000000000004s)]
*  partisan, and then now in today's day and age has totally overestimated her current day relevance. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2522.48s)]
*  So my love affair with the old Oprah is over, but it doesn't diminish her early work and how talented she is. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2528.08s)]
*  I totally agree. If you go back and look, even when she was in Baltimore as a local anchor, she was an [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2534.2400000000002s)]
*  incredible communicator, and her sense of how to communicate and sort of engage the audience was phenomenal. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2538.08s)]
*  Is there anybody today on the air who you think is a very compelling broadcaster? [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2545.04s)]
*  Well, I like Jesse Waters on Fox a lot. That's the one show that's on TV news, like cable news [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2552.8s)]
*  right now, that I would watch. I can't think of anyone else. What would you list as Jesse's brand? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2559.68s)]
*  Besides humor is obviously a big part of it. Yeah, and he too knows what the news target is. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2566.64s)]
*  He's good at finding himself right over the right, the proper target, and approaches it with cleverness [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2573.6s)]
*  and factual backup, and he's pretty fearless, which is important in today's day and age. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2579.28s)]
*  All right, how am I doing asking you questions you've never been asked? 50%. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2584.56s)]
*  You're doing very well. All right, here we go. Let's keep going. This is what we call the rapid [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2587.28s)]
*  round human interest section. Who is living you've never met who you'd like to meet and why? [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2592.8s)]
*  Living never met? I mean, I'm sorry, but it's Meghan Markle. She and I need to sit down across [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2599.28s)]
*  from one another and we will break the internet. Can I come to that? Yes. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2603.12s)]
*  I'll be your graphics PA or I'll help with hair and makeup. I would like to be there for that. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2608.0s)]
*  Literally everybody would watch that. Have you come close to meeting her? [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2612.08s)]
*  Well, I should have gone. I was in the Time 100 this year, and she was too, which is also ridiculous. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2615.84s)]
*  And they invited me to go to this like summit the day before where they interview you about how [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2621.12s)]
*  important you are. And I said no. And naturally she said yes. So we could have crossed paths if I had [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2626.0s)]
*  just been more self aggrandizing. Do you have your booking request in? [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2631.12s)]
*  I gotta be honest. I haven't actually submitted that because the futility of it seems obvious. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2635.84s)]
*  So, well, so you're saying the person you'd most like to meet you haven't even asked to me, [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2640.88s)]
*  even though you could know. No, it's one of those things where it might be too important to me to [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2644.8s)]
*  continue to be able to make fun of her. Like, I don't know if I could make up or like patch [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2649.84s)]
*  things up or somehow be wooed by her mark because being able to mock her is too important to me. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2654.6400000000003s)]
*  I've never met her, but I think the chances that she would melt your heart and win you over are [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2660.2400000000002s)]
*  de minimis. I think you're right. I would say. All right. What's a place you've never been that [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2664.56s)]
*  you'd like to go and why? I'd love to go to Japan. I've never been to Japan. I've never been to Asia [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2669.68s)]
*  and you know where else though, domestically, I've never been to the Pacific Northwest. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2678.08s)]
*  Never, never Seattle, Portland. These are massive holes, Megan. I know. I know. I haven't had a lot [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2681.92s)]
*  of time. I've been to Japan like 25 times. It's my favorite place. It's my favorite place in the [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2688.24s)]
*  world. Let's all go. Let's take the kids and I'll show you around. Let's make it an MK media [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2692.8799999999997s)]
*  excursion. Best architecture, best food, best service economy. It's an incredible place. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2698.64s)]
*  Yeah, it's definitely on my bucket list. All right. All right. It takes a little while to get there, [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2704.3999999999996s)]
*  by the way. All right. What is the greatest movie of all time? [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2708.4799999999996s)]
*  Mm. I mean, are we talking my favorite or just definitively the greatest movie? [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2714.56s)]
*  Yeah. Your favorite. Greatest for you. What is your favorite movie? [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2719.36s)]
*  My favorite movie of all time is Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2722.56s)]
*  The original. The original. I'm obsessed. I've never even seen the imitations I refused. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2725.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah. How are you at imitating the Wonka near the final scene when Charlie walks in and he says, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2729.92s)]
*  Good day, sir. Can you do that? He says, You bumped into the ceiling, [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2738.56s)]
*  which now has to be cleaned and sterilized so you get nothing. You lose. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2743.04s)]
*  And also, good day. Snow shines a good deed in a weary world. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2750.0s)]
*  That's a sweet moment. Are you so in love with that movie that you can differentiate between [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2754.48s)]
*  the Oompa Loompas or they're all pretty much the same? I can differentiate. I've actually spoken [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2759.28s)]
*  with one of the Oompa Loompas, if you must know, and I watched the whole movie four years ago [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2763.04s)]
*  next to the real Veruca Salt. Come on. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2769.7599999999998s)]
*  Julie Dawn Cole, who's now all grown up and living in London, and she came to my hotel and we watched [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2774.16s)]
*  it together. We decorated the whole thing with Willy Wonka apparatus and we kicked balloons together [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2779.92s)]
*  like she does in that one scene. Is there a video of that? Is there a video of that? [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2786.72s)]
*  Yes. I'll give it to you. You can lay it in here. Okay. I'd like to see that. Lay it in here. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2788.96s)]
*  We sang her song. I want it all. I mean, I peaked. That was it. I had peaked. It was my 50th birthday [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2791.68s)]
*  present. All right. Based on that, I think I might know the answer, but let's say Charlie was not [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2797.9199999999996s)]
*  eligible to win. Of the other kids, who was most deserving? Oh, wow. Well, no, it wasn't Veruca, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2802.0s)]
*  for sure. She was the worst. Not Augustus. I guess I'd have to go with Mike TV. I mean, what did he do? [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2810.72s)]
*  Mike TV just watched a bunch of TV. That's really not so bad. [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2815.6s)]
*  How's your Mike TV imitation? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2818.96s)]
*  I'm trying to think. He had a lisp. So, did he have to incorporate that? Yeah. Like, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2824.2400000000002s)]
*  dad says I can't have a real one. Not to your 12th son. Something like that. Not bad. Did you have a [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2830.8s)]
*  favorite of the grandparents? Well, of course, it's grandpa Joe. I mean, the other three just sat in [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2836.8s)]
*  the bed. They didn't even try to get up. So, that was sad. But I do love the parents who are brought [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2842.4s)]
*  along on the tour inside the Wonka factory. There's little lines that I just constantly [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2847.52s)]
*  throw out like, rock Mononov. You boil him up, I know it. There's so many great ones from that, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2852.8s)]
*  that I could recite the whole thing from memory when I watch it. I know every line. And the bargain [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2858.16s)]
*  that my family makes with me is, don't do that. Stop doing that. It's annoying. I believe I remember [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2864.48s)]
*  correctly, you do not fancy yourself a singer. Am I right about that? No, no. I think I have a decent [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2871.04s)]
*  speaking voice and I have an absolutely terrible singing voice. All right. The last thing I'll say [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2876.96s)]
*  about Wonka is when the elevator breaks through the roof, it chills every time it happens. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2881.2s)]
*  Every time I watch it, it just chills. Well, Marc, and you know what else is so great? I mean, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2888.48s)]
*  it's just that there's so much to love about the movie. I mean, I think one of the reasons I love [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  it so much is because I watched it when I was a kid. And I watched it a lot after my dad died when [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2897.04s)]
*  I was 15. And it kind of reminds me of a time where, I don't know, I was just feeling connected with [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2901.76s)]
*  my family. And it's about the terrible people getting their comeuppance and good people getting [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2906.32s)]
*  rewarded for their goodness. So there's a basic morality to it as well. But the last line of the [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2914.32s)]
*  movie is Wonka saying to Charlie Bucket, don't forget what happens to the boy who suddenly got [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2919.92s)]
*  everything he always wanted. He lived happily ever after. And I think about that all the time. Like, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2926.2400000000002s)]
*  if you just persevere, right? If you are a good person, if you don't chase false gods, [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2932.48s)]
*  if you just live by your own moral code to the best of your ability, I believe that last line. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2938.32s)]
*  I believe it's possible. It's the Wonka life lesson. There are two more Wonka things. First, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2944.88s)]
*  I am so loyal to the original in general, and I have no use for the, what's that guy's name? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2949.36s)]
*  Johnny Depp. No use to Johnny Depp. But I will tell you, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2955.28s)]
*  Chalamet is pretty good. If you don't consider it like a blight on the original, Chalamet is [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2958.64s)]
*  pretty good. Last thing, I love to play the version of the equivalent of the newlywed game [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2965.52s)]
*  between anchors and their producers. I love to see when they agree. So here's my question. [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2970.4s)]
*  Are we doing that? Yeah, we're doing that. Just one question. Will Steve Krakauer say after this, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2974.96s)]
*  I can't believe Mark wasted 10 minutes talking about Wonka? Or will he say, [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2978.88s)]
*  this thing is awesome, it's going to go viral? Which do you think Steve will say? [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2982.56s)]
*  The latter. He'll love it. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2985.2s)]
*  He'll love it? Okay. Steve, are you on? Steve, are you there? Try him in. I can't wait to find out. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2986.72s)]
*  All right, last two, because we're up against the clock as happens even on the internet. What was [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2991.6s)]
*  the biggest break of your career? And I don't want you to say when Fox hired you, because that's [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=2996.16s)]
*  too easy. Besides that- No, it wasn't. That wasn't the biggest break anyway. It was [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3000.7999999999997s)]
*  when I had made a resume tape, but no one knew who I was. I had no connections in news. I was [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3007.7599999999998s)]
*  just a frustrated lawyer. I didn't know what to do. I had one of those moments where I was like, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3014.32s)]
*  I'm never going to get into news. I'm 32, which I thought was old. And I'm like, I know nobody. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3021.28s)]
*  And then one day, Mark, I stayed home and I almost never, ever call in sick to work during my law [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3026.88s)]
*  career or as a TV broadcaster. I really genuinely have to be throwing up all day for me not to go [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3034.2400000000002s)]
*  to work. And I was. And I had on Lifetime television, Mark Halperin. Yes, it's true. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3039.2s)]
*  I was living in Baltimore, Maryland, and I watched the Jessica Savage story on Lifetime TV. And it [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3045.9199999999996s)]
*  was that story of this amazing broadcaster who came up in the time of Connie Chung, who made it [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3055.04s)]
*  in a man's world when it was impossible to do so. And she did it. And I thought, you know what? [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3059.8399999999997s)]
*  If she could do it then, why can't I do it now? And I started cold calling news directors. And [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3065.92s)]
*  it was Bill Lord, who was the news director at WJLA, the ABC affiliate in Washington, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3070.6400000000003s)]
*  which also happened to have a lesser known cable channel. News channel eight. Yeah. I thought maybe [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3075.2000000000003s)]
*  I could get hired at news channel eight, not even realizing that there was a chance he could put me [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3081.6800000000003s)]
*  on ABC. And that guy, I convinced him to let me drop off my resume in person, which was huge [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3085.52s)]
*  because I knew given my nine years of law practice, I could talk my way into the job. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3093.84s)]
*  And I did. That was the biggest break. What's the biggest break you've had since you left NBC? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3098.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, I guess. Look, if they didn't have the madness of the George Floyd mania in 2020, [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3106.1600000000003s)]
*  I might still be sitting on the couch. It was the insanity that the country came under that got me [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3114.6400000000003s)]
*  up and off my couch and willing to broadcast in my children's playroom with no video camera and two [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3121.12s)]
*  listeners. So in a way, that was a break for me that the news cycle came in and just touched on [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3126.24s)]
*  all these things that are really important to me, like fairness and justice and due process and [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3132.48s)]
*  facts about cops that were being misrepresented left and right that I got off that couch and [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3136.48s)]
*  started what turned out to be a good show. Finally, I know you've never been asked this one. [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3141.7599999999998s)]
*  What's your best advice for me in succeeding in this world? [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3145.68s)]
*  Well, you're an excellent interviewer. I think you just proved that. But I think your thoughts [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3151.12s)]
*  on the news and politics are what people are going to tune in for. So if I were you, I'd open, [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3158.24s)]
*  and I know you've been doing a lot of this, but I would open every show with at least 20 minutes [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3163.44s)]
*  of what Mark Halpern thinks about the news stories because everybody will listen to that. [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3166.64s)]
*  All right. Megan, couldn't be more grateful to you for spending this time [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3171.8399999999997s)]
*  for your Wonka reminiscence, but also again, for giving me the opportunity to be part of [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3174.88s)]
*  your growing network. I'm grateful to you. The pleasure is all mine, Mark. Keep going. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3178.96s)]
*  The show is already a huge success. We've been thrilled. You far exceeded our expectations [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3183.6800000000003s)]
*  for a month into launch, and I know it's just blue skies ahead. I want to tell you about Lean, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3188.32s)]
*  created by a doctor and university researcher to match the goals of those GLP-1s, but without the [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3194.2400000000002s)]
*  injections. Lean says the studied ingredients, their product are shown to lower blood sugar, [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3200.72s)]
*  radically reduce appetite, and burn fat by converting it into energy. If you are struggling [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3206.3199999999997s)]
*  to lose weight, Lean might be for you. Let me share a few testimonials so you can hear about [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3210.9599999999996s)]
*  their results. One gal named Patty, who's a customer, says it is the first weight loss product [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3216.16s)]
*  that's actually curbed her appetite. Two more testimonials emphasize how Lean can be a lifesaver [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3221.52s)]
*  after years of weight loss struggles. It's even helped one customer increase their energy. So [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3226.88s)]
*  consider trying it for yourself if it sounds right for you. You can get started with 20% off by using [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3231.6s)]
*  code MK20 at takelean.com. That's code MK20 at takelean.com. Again, takelean.com. Results vary. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3236.48s)]
*  These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA and is not intended. The statements are to [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3244.6400000000003s)]
*  diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease, and the product's not a substitute for care from a [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3249.92s)]
*  healthcare provider. I am beyond honored and so excited to have Megyn Kelly, my fellow astronaut, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3255.28s)]
*  expanding her resume as an actress, a producer, non- like what can't this woman do, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3264.48s)]
*  is now a guest on the nerve. Look at this. Thank you MK for coming on the show. I so appreciate it. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3271.92s)]
*  I mean, I'm everywhere. The two of us are everywhere, but we're making it happen, Maureen. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3277.76s)]
*  I love it. I love it too. I love it too. And I have been dying to talk to you about Michelle [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3282.72s)]
*  Obama's ongoing midlife meltdown. Like as you put it, her stegosaurus hairdos. The utterance the [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3289.4399999999996s)]
*  other day, she says she's transitioning. I mean, I think we both know what she's trying to do by [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3298.8799999999997s)]
*  using that word. I mean, what do you make of all of this? Like what's going on in that psyche? [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3304.3199999999997s)]
*  I think that that transitioning line was meant to get attention because her podcast is failing. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3309.44s)]
*  No one wants to watch it and she's not used to that. You know, she's used to being the center [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3315.6s)]
*  of attention. Everyone's interested in me. I don't have to try hard. And so now she's embarrassed. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3319.76s)]
*  And so I think she's intentionally dropping these little nuggets in these podcasts just so she can [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3326.8s)]
*  get pick up and talking here and there about her marriage because she knows that she'll get pick up [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3331.84s)]
*  if she talks about him. You know, it's kind of like Meghan and Harry where it's like the man is [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3337.44s)]
*  the star and the woman is kind of the glomer. She's like the also ran like we're interested in her to [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3343.12s)]
*  the extent she's going to tell us about him. And she knows that so she's working it, but she can't [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3348.56s)]
*  hide her general morose nature. So the more you tune into these clips, nevermind that show. And [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3354.32s)]
*  I actually have tried to watch it because it's our business. It's terrible. She's the most [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3362.48s)]
*  depressing person to spend time with. So it's going to continue failing. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3368.08s)]
*  100%. I mean, she well, for one thing, the transitioning thing struck me so strangely [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3373.28s)]
*  because this is the, this is the third rail on the left, right? Like, like the, the people who call, [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3379.28s)]
*  you know, Michelle Obama knows this, that like online, there's a cohort of people that call her [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3385.6s)]
*  big Mike and who maintain that she is a guy, is a dude. Okay. That's what they maintain. I'm just [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3390.48s)]
*  saying. And so she's very cynically using this word. And then she's going to turn around and [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3396.72s)]
*  be like, how dare you interpret it that way. That is such a disgusting misreading of everything. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3402.96s)]
*  I'm saying I go high when they go low, right? But she's going low. Yeah. Well, I mean, that was a [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3407.84s)]
*  lie to begin with and, you know, tell it to your husband who showed up at that Democratic [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3415.28s)]
*  campaign office when people weren't rallying behind Kamala Harris and called a bunch of [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3421.36s)]
*  Democrat voters, half of whom were men, half of whom were black, racists and sexists, [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3427.28s)]
*  because they weren't getting behind Kamala Harris. Like that doesn't seem like going high to me. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3434.0800000000004s)]
*  And her husband and she have been out there suggesting Trump is Hitler. She wouldn't even [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3439.6000000000004s)]
*  go to Trump's inauguration. It doesn't seem like the high road. So she wants credit for taking the [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3443.28s)]
*  high road, even though, of course, she hasn't and she doesn't. And it's not where she spends her time. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3448.88s)]
*  It's just like anything, Maureen, you know, like you and I, we wouldn't be out there being like, [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3453.36s)]
*  we only take the high road. We have nothing to compensate for. We're perfectly content on [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3457.1200000000003s)]
*  the low road and we'll make no apologies for it while we're there. She's like, she's dishonest, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3462.1600000000003s)]
*  right? So she's got to say she's something other than what she is. Same way Anna Wintour had to [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3469.04s)]
*  pretend she understands the black experience because she decided to do black dandyism this [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3473.6s)]
*  year, even though there are no blacks running fashion houses. And even when they've kind of [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3478.8s)]
*  come under the microscope, she's kept it down to a minimum. So in any event, I think she's a [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3483.36s)]
*  hypocrite. I think she's false. But I think the thing that's genuine about her is her depression, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3488.0s)]
*  her unhappiness, her self-loathing and her loathing of him. Oh, 100%. And I think the [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3493.52s)]
*  Meghan Markle analogy is completely correct. I think we're seeing it now like Hilaria Baldwin [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3501.68s)]
*  is becoming much more aggressive against her husband because she's got the leverage now. [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3507.44s)]
*  Like it's cheaper to keep her like he can't divorce her. Like these cases have bankrupted him. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3512.16s)]
*  So she's out there talking, she's spilling all of his personal secrets. Like I'm going to get [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3518.8s)]
*  into this book she just wrote. But she's spilling all of his personal secrets and snapping at him [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3523.6000000000004s)]
*  on red carpets and basically saying, I run this show. People are interested in me, not you. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3528.88s)]
*  And just like those other two, she has not an original thought in her head. She has absolutely [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3533.6000000000004s)]
*  nothing to say. She has nothing to offer. She is in deep rage that she is well known only because [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3538.32s)]
*  of the marriage she made. And I think really resents the person she decided to marry. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3544.72s)]
*  And with Michelle and Meghan Markle and Hilaria's unusual because the bulk of the media is still [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3551.12s)]
*  pretending like she didn't tell us she was from Spain. She just likes to adopt a Spanish accent. [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3558.0s)]
*  Right. Greatest story ever. Greatest story ever. But there's something about these two women in [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3563.04s)]
*  particular rich beyond their wildest dreams. They got a level of fame they never would have gotten [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3567.7599999999998s)]
*  on their own. And I don't know what is going on in there. I think there are people who will [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3571.76s)]
*  never let themselves be happy. And I think there are people who are comfortable in a state of [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3580.88s)]
*  grievance and martyrdom and rage. See, this drives me nuts because I know a lot of rich women, [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3586.48s)]
*  rich because they married a rich man and they're fine. They're cool. They're thrilled. [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3595.7599999999998s)]
*  They don't run around like overcompensating all the time or trying to prove to everybody, [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3602.72s)]
*  I am also special. I'm special too. They're like, my life's grand. I got these nice cars [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3608.7999999999997s)]
*  and this nice house and this guy who takes care of me. Like that is the way to do it. If you decide [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3615.7599999999998s)]
*  to do it. What happened in both of these cases is they shot for the moon and they got it. Harry [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3621.84s)]
*  landed the elephant. She got her prince and Michelle got the star at Harvard who was very [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3628.96s)]
*  clear was going to be making a huge impact in Democrat politics. And then they spent the rest [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3635.04s)]
*  of the time seemingly resentful or even jealous. That's what I detect from these two women. There's [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3640.96s)]
*  an envy by them toward their husbands for being the main stars to the point where now Meghan [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3647.68s)]
*  Markle has almost like rearranged it all. You know, Dan Wooden was on my show the other day saying, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3653.2s)]
*  he's now realized he's the he's the spare to her. She's so used his fame and connections and his [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3658.64s)]
*  ability to help her make money that she's re-engineered the whole thing to where she's [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3668.8799999999997s)]
*  the breadwinner and he is just the whipped loser back at the house, which is exactly what Michelle [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3674.48s)]
*  Obama would kill for. She doesn't want Barack Obama in the headlines anymore. She wants it to [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  be her. And so she's crapping all over him while still kind of using the Obama name and the time [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3688.88s)]
*  in the White House to make herself relevant. Right. And so like I this is what I think this [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3694.96s)]
*  is just one long tease. Like I think she wants out. I think he would be happy to be done with [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3700.24s)]
*  her. Okay. Yes. Like is he like paying his penance for becoming the first black president [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3704.7999999999997s)]
*  and like seeming to be like a kind of decent guy? Like is he paying his penance because [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3711.2s)]
*  Michelle isn't as great as he is and she never will be. So he's just going to suck it up until [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3715.92s)]
*  she is he going to let her be the one to file. I just I just find this I never seen such deep [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3720.96s)]
*  loathing on the public stage. I was trying to think of any other famous person who's gone [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3728.32s)]
*  through a divorce. I mean I don't think since Woody and Mia frankly it's been something like [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3734.0s)]
*  this disgusting you know like have your dignity. I mean other than someone who's a sworn enemy [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3737.6800000000003s)]
*  of yours have you ever talked that negatively about somebody uniformly? You know like you can [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3744.1600000000003s)]
*  never say anything nice about them. It's like okay now there are public figures who we don't [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3751.1200000000003s)]
*  like and we criticize but like someone who's in your life who you get asked about. Like it's just [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=3754.64s)]

*  and she's saying she thinks that's the wrong way to go in life because Michelle the master of [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4059.2799999999997s)]
*  grievances likes to hash that shit out she likes to beat that carcass further into the ground and [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4064.24s)]
*  she will not let go and you have to have like a multi-day summit and then revisit that maybe [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4071.2799999999997s)]
*  months down the road and she's saying that's the healthy way to be. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4076.8s)]
*  Yeah so that's the difference between her spouse who doesn't seem to put up with her nonsense and [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4080.7200000000003s)]
*  her endless wanting you know to have these talks about everything and Megan's spouse because Megan [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4087.6800000000003s)]
*  married somebody who is not well Megan Markle like Prince Harry is a weak damaged man who doesn't [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4094.4s)]
*  have the inner strength that Barack Obama has even though I mean listen I understand [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4101.28s)]
*  Barack Obama's faults and the vein and all like just of all of that but he doesn't have like such [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4105.04s)]
*  a tiny id the way Harry does who does like he doesn't really have a fundamental sense of himself [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4111.68s)]
*  and so he was so easy for Megan Markle to manipulate all she needed was that first meeting [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4117.28s)]
*  she was totally right that he would be like putty in her hands that he would buy he's too dumb you [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4125.36s)]
*  know of course he bought every act she delivered hook line and sinker her little ingenue I'm so [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4132.16s)]
*  sweet and innocent I don't even know who the queen is I had no idea you were a prince and he ran with [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4138.16s)]

*  the doldrums of like the only thing miserable miserable people want is to make others miserable [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4150.08s)]
*  too and she can't seem to do it with him she you know she's only gotten more angry in my opinion [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4155.28s)]
*  because she can't do it to him he's got too big a life he's too important to too many people [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4160.56s)]
*  and she's not his only company and he will not take the bait he will not allow himself to be [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4165.92s)]
*  debased this way like he's kind of gray rocking it he's not responding to any of it yeah and he [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4172.240000000001s)]
*  does strike me fundamentally as an optimistic person he strikes me as somebody who really enjoys [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4178.0s)]
*  life you know and like he's not going to get down in the mud with this and I think you're right I [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4183.92s)]
*  think his lack of response is sending her into a further and further rage spiral because she can't [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4190.24s)]
*  get what she wants any attention is better than no attention and it goes to her husband it goes to [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4195.92s)]

*  always about how racist we are we elected her husband twice twice and celebrated her I mean [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4235.6s)]
*  she's still as far as I know to this day is one of the most popular figures in the country [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4243.28s)]
*  it's never enough she's so much happier talking about her anger and her disappointment [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4250.24s)]
*  in the failure that we all are to her 100% and in that vein I wanted to know your thoughts about [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4257.44s)]

*  in which he says two two things that do not go together he implies that the British royal family [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4272.48s)]
*  had something to do with Diana's death that they would like to see grievous harm we know what that [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4279.5199999999995s)]
*  means come to Harry and Megan and their two small innocent children and also that he would love to [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4285.839999999999s)]

*  not true and the one that is not true is his desire for reconciliation he does believe all those things [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4308.72s)]
*  I think he actually does believe them I think it stems back to his childhood trauma which was [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4314.96s)]
*  genuine at the loss of his mother the way she died and unlike William who also had the same trauma [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4320.320000000001s)]
*  and was only a couple of years older than Harry dealt with it like he dealt with it and went on to [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4326.64s)]

*  of the healthiest things he did part of him falling in love with Catherine Princess of Wales I really [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4451.92s)]
*  think had to do with her family of origin and they were intact and they were loving and they [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4457.36s)]
*  seemed to have a very healthy emotional sort of relationship amongst all of all of them and he [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4462.719999999999s)]
*  was very attracted to that and I think he found that normalcy and that groundedness and and the [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4468.799999999999s)]
*  things that you know he was maybe lacking given his birthright and Harry meanwhile was just left [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4474.08s)]
*  to stew in it and I think the thing too that you're saying is so right on and it's so perverse [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4481.2s)]
*  because like in that BBC interview he was bragging that like on the on the threat hit list he's [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4487.2s)]
*  number one yeah like he's right sure I would not be bragging about that if I've if if a government [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4492.0s)]
*  agency came to me and said you know what Maureen suddenly for whatever reason you're like at the [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4498.16s)]
*  top of the list of people who are going to be like in grave danger I would be like you're an [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4502.5599999999995s)]
*  astronaut let me not publicize that right right that doesn't seem bright right no he's I've never [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4506.4s)]
*  seen somebody so anxious to disclose his alleged security threats I mean it's it is strange like [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4513.599999999999s)]
*  I actually had a very very dark period when I first became a journalist where I developed a very bad [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4520.16s)]
*  stalker I was nobody knew who I was I was on the weekend shifts on Fox but I nobody knew you [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4526.0s)]
*  weren't that famous yet not at all not at all but you just happen to be the one person who [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4532.4s)]
*  developed this very dangerous stalker and now I talk about it this 20 years ago right like so long [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4536.32s)]
*  resolved the guy went to jail for 10 years um but at the time I would rather be caught dead I was [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4541.839999999999s)]
*  like hell no anything I say could like encourage the person or create another such person or like [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4549.44s)]
*  if you're actually under threat and genuinely afraid for your safety you don't want to go [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4558.96s)]
*  anywhere near that discussion and the whole lawsuit with the family and the security that was just his [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4564.4s)]
*  attempt to to like win you know to punish them to say like you're not in control of me like I will [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4571.28s)]
*  get what I'm entitled to I'm a prince of England you know I will have it because we all know number [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4577.84s)]
*  one he has the money to pay for private security all the private security he wants now it's true [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4583.84s)]
*  you cannot arm them in Great Britain they're not allowed to carry guns so that's a diminishment of [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4590.24s)]
*  full protection but it's what Taylor Swift has to deal with it's what Tom Cruise has to deal with [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4597.04s)]
*  it's what every massive star way more famous than Harry has to deal with when they go to the UK and [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4602.400000000001s)]
*  speaking of stalkers I guarantee you Taylor Swift is in far more danger at any public appearance [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4608.16s)]
*  than Prince Harry is so but but the second point Dan Wooden told me he's he broke Megxit he's broken [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4613.04s)]
*  all these big royal stories that the the king said to Harry okay Queen Elizabeth said you cannot have [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4620.56s)]
*  the security the same as you would if you were working royal we cannot look at the taxpayers [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4628.4s)]
*  and tell them they have to foot that bill since you're not doing any work for us and you've fled [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4632.96s)]
*  the coop and you're trying to make money off of all our stories on Netflix but whenever you come [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4636.32s)]
*  here you can stay in Buckingham Palace and you'll get all the security that comes with that and Harry [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4642.08s)]
*  refuses to do it even though Maureen no one's in Buckingham Palace William and Kate are at a [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4651.28s)]
*  different palace and so are Charles and Camilla so we'd have Buckingham Palace to himself with all [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4657.28s)]
*  the security and he still is on the BBC going boo fucking who feels sorry for me incredible such [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4663.68s)]
*  a great point and like let's say even a family member happened to be in Buckingham Palace it's [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4672.0s)]
*  like you could conceivably never see them okay you've got like 85 rooms and staff and foot soldiers [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4676.96s)]
*  and it's all going to be fine I wanted to ask you the ditty trial we are in day four it's it's [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4685.68s)]
*  happening in New York City they are still winnowing down this jury pool and the judge in the case said [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4692.4s)]
*  that the celebrity names that are documented and submitted to the court are like this thick he [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4697.92s)]
*  compared it to the Lord of the Rings book okay so have you heard about some of the celebrity names [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4703.92s)]
*  that have come out I heard it on the nerve I think you were talking about on your last episode [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4709.84s)]
*  and then the latest I heard was that she wasn't a celebrity witness but she was the key one of the [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4714.72s)]
*  key accusers has gone missing what yeah I didn't hear that yeah and she was supposed to show up [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4720.72s)]
*  and they can't find her and there's a search I don't know if she's absconded like she's having [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4727.6s)]
*  second thoughts about testifying or there was even just a miscommunication issue that caused [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4732.320000000001s)]
*  her not to show up but I'm sure people are very intimidated about walking into that courtroom and [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4737.04s)]
*  testifying against him I mean I have an even more sinister thought that somebody did away with her [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4742.240000000001s)]
*  yeah I mean look if you believe her to the point that she fled for her life yeah well look we saw [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4748.96s)]
*  him beat his ex-girlfriend and then we read the allegations from the main ex-girlfriend who's like [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4755.84s)]
*  one of the main accusers in this case Cassie who's going to take the stand and then you know [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4763.04s)]
*  allegedly setting the car on fire of the kid Cuddy kid Cuddy yeah like the same person you know the [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4768.0s)]
*  same woman like if he's capable of all of that allegedly I mean we know the beating happened [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4774.64s)]
*  we saw it with our own eyes in a hotel hallway yeah then how far would he go I like I don't know [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4780.400000000001s)]
*  I mean look I said this on my show this week and it's true I went to the Met Gala I went two years [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4788.96s)]
*  Maureen and what I remember yes you know Anna Wintour and I used to be well no we weren't friends [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4794.96s)]
*  but she was cozying up to me when she thought Trump didn't like me she was like oh that I must [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4802.0s)]
*  like her so um I went there and the thing I remember most from being there was P. Diddy [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4806.8s)]
*  in the restroom of the Met it was the women's room that's why I was there dry humping a [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4813.76s)]
*  Kardashian like I heard the dry humping anecdote but I don't think you revealed the name yeah it [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4819.92s)]
*  was there were multiple Kardashians in there and like that other sort of lame supermodel version [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4825.68s)]
*  like not the real supermodels like we grew up with but like these new influencer types right [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4832.0s)]
*  they're all in there no one was using the bathroom they were smoking and dry humping and that was P. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4835.84s)]
*  Diddy like I'm just saying there's a pattern of disrespect for others and our sacred places [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4841.6s)]
*  and things that should be treated as in violet and it applies to places and it applies to people and [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4847.6s)]
*  I have no idea what this guy is capable of but I think it's probably worse than we can even imagine [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4853.2s)]
*  so if I were in the SDNY I'd be really seriously considering getting all of my witnesses [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4859.68s)]
*  protection and making sure that neither he nor his people had any way of threatening or accessing them [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4866.48s)]
*  can I just get back to the Met bathroom for a moment the important part of the story [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4875.2s)]
*  so pities in pity Diddy is it P did whatever pity works dry humping a Kardashian as other [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4880.08s)]
*  Kardashian siblings are in there watching and smoking that is so disgusting yeah like the [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4890.08s)]
*  smoking is less disgusting than like I mean in the siblings watching you engage in a sexual act it's [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4896.8s)]
*  so gross well look it's like the Met you can't smoke in the Met like fine you would have you [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4902.16s)]
*  smoke it's fine but like truly some of our most sacred works of art are inside the Met there's no [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4908.08s)]
*  smoking you cannot smoke and Doug was in the men's room with two people whose names you would [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4913.84s)]
*  definitely know who are of the tech world snorting coke like this is a lovely gala these are the [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4919.28s)]
*  people who think there are betters who look down at you know the great unwashed is like oh that [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4925.2s)]
*  can't come to Anna Wintour's the Met gala but it's no surprise to me that this guy wound up being a [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4930.64s)]
*  complete cretin and I don't know whether SDNY's got the case made I really don't because you know [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4936.56s)]
*  for the same reasons you guys were discussing with the lawyer on your case on your show the other day [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4942.88s)]
*  I'm sure he's going to argue I love sex parties people love to give it up to me for free because [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4947.84s)]
*  I was rich and I was a rap mogul and I don't have to force anybody into it like trust me yeah and [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4952.56s)]
*  you can't criminalize my weird sex parties as a big star I think that'll be the defense I think [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4959.6s)]
*  it'll be convicted but you know I wouldn't bet money on it Maureen because that kind of defense [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4964.08s)]
*  you know Harvey Weinstein's doing the same thing right now in another courtroom and [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4970.48s)]
*  he might get away with it too Harvey might get away with it but um my other my other at the other [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4974.48s)]
*  aspect of the defense strategy that I love is hey like he loves to buy baby oil in bulk like you know [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4981.2s)]
*  everybody loves a bargain everybody loves to go to Costco yeah right like who doesn't live to buy [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4986.96s)]
*  like 12 bounty select a size you know why not knock that out listen I my big takeaway on that [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4991.76s)]
*  was like I feel like Doug and I might be phoning it in like do I do are you not having enough sex [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=4998.320000000001s)]
*  parties Megan and like covered with baby oil everybody should we just eat you've been to my [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5004.0s)]
*  house for a party Maureen I like I feel like we fell down on the job well I was anticipating [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5009.6s)]
*  something a little spicier I will tell you but you know I I may do with Doug's delicious cocktails [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5014.4800000000005s)]
*  right here's your cocktail and your baby oil see you in 20 minutes I'm easy I'm easy you know [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5020.4s)]
*  I can hang I'm a good hang I think um yeah and so I guess the question then is like so for my my [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5026.96s)]
*  last question vis-a-vis Diddy is the celebrity names thus far that has shocked me is Mike Myers [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5034.0s)]
*  oh yeah Mike what is Mike Myers doing running with Diddy and his crew like this nerdy white [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5040.4s)]
*  comic Canadian like what's what is that I know I guess I mean Ashton Kutcher too which is not [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5046.96s)]
*  really a shock but like I I'm not shocked I don't know like as you know people are really dazzled [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5053.2s)]
*  by huge wealth and and not even just and and rock stars have it in a particular way like they're [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5061.44s)]
*  almost bigger than our actors like there's something about them that's like it's like you [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5071.2s)]
*  could say Tom Cruise is coming to the restaurant people would swoon for sure but like if you say [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5076.08s)]
*  like Rihanna is coming to the restaurant yeah you're gonna have to shut down the restaurant [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5081.44s)]
*  you're gonna have to get layers of cops it's just they're bigger they're just in a different [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5085.92s)]
*  stratosphere for whatever reason the mystery around them you know you feel like you know the [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5090.5599999999995s)]
*  actors because you hear them saying lines and you see them up close and the performers are different [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5095.76s)]
*  they've just got this incredible talent and they have this whole team around them that builds image [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5100.64s)]
*  and I just think that people are very susceptible to that kind of a person [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5104.96s)]
*  deigning to speak to them to want to be with them to entertain them and that's why mothers handed [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5110.24s)]
*  over their children like Usher and Justin Bieber you know and it's the same thing that led maybe [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5118.24s)]
*  Mike Myers to go into these ditty parties and allow himself to be in the presence of what [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5125.12s)]
*  may have been open crimes and like a roll of the eyes like I guess this is just how they live [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5131.12s)]
*  and I've been given this chance to peer inside yes you know it's human nature to want to see [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5136.48s)]
*  like what am I being shown how bad is it and I'll tell you one other story on this [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5142.96s)]
*  there was a woman who told me her Harvey Weinstein story I'm gonna keep this ambiguous so I don't [[01:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5148.8s)]
*  identify her inadvertently but he didn't touch her he was just really gross and did some outrageous [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5152.96s)]
*  things around her and I asked her like well why he didn't have you like under his control so why [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5159.6s)]
*  didn't you just like run or turn and leave and she said I was curious to see how far he was going to [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xi5HRL-tfSc&t=5165.280000000001s)]
