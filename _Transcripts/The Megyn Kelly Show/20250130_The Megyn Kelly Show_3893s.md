# Secretary Marco Rubio on Buying Greenland, His Trip to Panama, and How to End the Russia-Ukraine War
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [January 30, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show. Today, our exclusive interview [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=0.0s)]
*  with the 72nd Secretary of State Marco Rubio. This is his first long-form sit-down. He said it was [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=4.88s)]
*  his first interview since taking on the new role just over one week ago. Of all the Trump 2.0 [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=11.92s)]
*  nominees, he's the only one so far who gained entirely bipartisan support, passing unanimously [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=18.8s)]
*  by the Senate with a 99 to 0 vote and as the only nominee to receive a vote on day one of the second [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=25.92s)]
*  Trump administration. On the eve of his first foreign trip as Secretary of State, interestingly [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=32.800000000000004s)]
*  to Panama, we get into everything. We go to Greenland, we talk China, we talk Iran, Israel, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=37.760000000000005s)]
*  and we do get into the deep state. Enjoy. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=47.92s)]

*  We continue to face uncertainty when it comes to the economy with a perfect storm brewing as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=59.12s)]
*  Social Security and Medicare hit a breaking point as the largest generation is hitting retirement. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=63.68s)]
*  A smaller workforce means a smaller tax base. You pair that with our growing national debt [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=68.4s)]
*  and the rising cost of living and we could have a very big problem on our hands. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=72.72s)]
*  So what are you doing right now to protect your family for the future? [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=76.16s)]
*  Gold can be a very safe haven in very hard economic times and Birch Gold makes it easy [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=79.44s)]

*  Mr. Secretary, thank you so much for doing this. Thank you. It still feels weird to hear that. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=122.48s)]
*  It does, right? You're a week in now? Eight days, but I'm not counting. I'm saying it's been eight [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=126.32s)]
*  days. Yeah, eight, nine days. There's so much I want to go over like the change between the [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=130.64s)]
*  Senate and here. What's it like to be at the heart of the deep state? But let me start with [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=135.2s)]
*  the plane crash. Yeah. It's so awful. It is. It's horrible. I mean, just from a human standpoint of [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=141.67999999999998s)]
*  it, to think these are people that were landing. I mean, we've all been on these planes. You're [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=146.32s)]
*  getting ready to land. You're excited. You're getting ready to go. Maybe your phone's already [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=150.07999999999998s)]
*  connecting because you're ready to get on the ground and then something like this comes out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=153.11999999999998s)]
*  of the blue and it's a horrible tragedy. And we don't forget that there were service members [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  involved in this as well who lost their lives in this terrible accident. Obviously, it's not a [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=160.16s)]
*  State Department function, but the key to these is first to honor those who have passed and understand [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=165.2s)]
*  the pain of these families. The second is to figure out why this happened so that it never [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=170.64s)]
*  happens again. This is a very busy airport and there's a lot of traffic going in and out through [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=174.56s)]
*  this city. But it's just heartbreaking. And I'm sure as we hear the individual stories of the [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=179.12s)]
*  people involved will be even sadder. Does it underscore at all why President Trump needs his [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=183.92s)]
*  nominees confirmed quickly? Yeah, especially on the response part of it, right? I mean, so ultimately [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=189.04s)]
*  there was a failure here at some point. Like helicopters and airplanes are not supposed to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=193.6s)]
*  crash into each other in the capital of the United States at one of the busiest airports in the [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=196.72s)]
*  country. This isn't supposed to happen. So it happened for a reason and someone needs to lead [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=201.12s)]
*  a process that figures out why. And then you need to lead a process to make sure it doesn't happen [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  again. And look, it happened here. It could have happened in some other city too. And so you need [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=209.04s)]
*  to have someone at the head of these departments that are in charge of this. And it may be multiple [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=213.12s)]
*  departments because it's going to involve DOD. It's going to involve the Department of [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=218.16s)]
*  Transportation, but it may involve other elements of the U.S. government. And you need to have [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=221.35999999999999s)]
*  somebody running the agencies or they will not be. You're just not going to get the same [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=225.12s)]
*  responsiveness. Yeah, God forbid we had something happen on an international basis. You're installed, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=228.48s)]
*  but Tulsi's, you know, that one could take a while and there's been a little foot dragging. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=233.12s)]
*  All right. So you've been in the job now for eight days. What's the biggest difference between [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=238.16s)]
*  being a U.S. Senator and being the Secretary of State? Well, two things. First of all, my boss [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=241.35999999999999s)]
*  is President Trump is a person that moves very quickly. I'll give you a perfect example. This [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=245.52s)]
*  weekend we had a disagreement, not with Colombia, with the president of Colombia, who at four [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=250.72s)]
*  something in the morning decided to turn around flights that he had agreed to. We have it in [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=256.32s)]
*  writing. They agreed. These are Colombian nationals illegally in the United States. And they have, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=260.48s)]
*  I mean, under international agreements, they have to take back their nationals and they agreed to [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=265.36s)]
*  it. At four thirty in the morning, he for whatever reason was either awake or about to go to bed. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=268.88s)]
*  And he decided to go on X and write that he had ordered that the one plane was halfway there and [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=273.76s)]
*  the other had just taken off and ordered them turned around. And so in a traditional administration, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=278.48s)]
*  I would have taken about two and a half years to react to it. It would have gone through all this [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=283.28s)]
*  and all these policy options with President Trump. It happened within a matter of hours. It was very [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=288.08s)]
*  quick. And so the ability to execute on action, on directive is a big difference between being in [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=292.24s)]
*  the Senate, the Senate, the House play a very important role, but it doesn't have the executive [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=297.44s)]
*  role. And the executive part of it is the one that I think is the biggest difference, the ability [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=302.32s)]
*  to see a problem and under our authorities address it. And when you're working for someone like [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=306.96s)]
*  President Trump, it's going to happen very quickly. There's not going to be a lot of debate. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=311.36s)]
*  You know, in the wake of that plane crash, I had to wonder last night whether, you know, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=315.2s)]
*  the their predecessors from the prior administration were calling Pete Hegseth, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=320.24s)]
*  were calling Sean Duffy. Have you spoken with Anthony Blinken at all? Was there any sort of [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=324.64s)]
*  good tidings sent your way? Well, it's not at the State Department. It's possible because when we're [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=328.8s)]
*  in our offices, we don't have our phones here in this building because for security reasons. So [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=333.04s)]
*  it's possible they've reached out as of this morning. But the truth of the matter is, you know, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=336.72s)]
*  this is, well, there may be a state component if there were internationals on the flights of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=342.0s)]
*  citizen of another country. You know, we obviously would notify their embassy or consulate because [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=346.56s)]
*  their families and loved ones for that notification. But I would expect that at DOD because obviously [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=351.2s)]
*  that was the Department of Defense. That was a military helicopter. Three service members have [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=356.48s)]
*  lost their lives and then most certainly in Department of Transportation because they have [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=360.48s)]
*  the primary jurisdiction over the FAA and the broader airplane safety challenges. But what [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=364.16s)]
*  about just since you took the job? Is there is like does he give you a letter in the way that Biden [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=370.0s)]
*  left? He did. He left a very nice note and basically said, welcome to the best job in the world and I'm [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=374.16s)]
*  here to help anything you need. And it's like I said, it's a really important job. It needs to [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=380.48s)]
*  become even more important. The State Department, in my view, over the years has become less and [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=385.52s)]
*  less relevant in the making a foreign policy for a variety of reasons. Not because there aren't [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=390.47999999999996s)]
*  talented people in the State Department. There are. And I've known that from the past interacting with [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=396.56s)]
*  them, but because it moved too slowly, because it took too long to action, because you gave a [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=400.47999999999996s)]
*  directive and it took so long for the State Department to do something because of internal [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=405.59999999999997s)]
*  processes or whatever that largely administrations would start to work around the State Department. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=409.12s)]
*  And I want the State Department to be relevant again. I want it to be at the center of foreign [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=414.16s)]
*  policy making. And so that's by providing advice to the President who ultimately makes the decision [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=419.68s)]
*  about what we're going to do. So it's a great job. And I tell you, it's not just the position, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=425.76000000000005s)]
*  but to be Secretary of State for Donald Trump is a great job because you know you're not going to [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=432.0s)]
*  be wasting a lot of time. Once a decision is made, you're going to get to act. It's such a tricky [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=436.56s)]
*  time to be Secretary of State, especially as a Republican, because you look at the Republican [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=440.96s)]
*  Party and it's fractured internally about where we should be on foreign policy. It's not like during [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=446.32s)]
*  the Bush years where it was, you know, we were much more neo-Khani on the right. And now there's a real [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=451.52s)]
*  division within the right, within MAGA even, on how what should we do about Ukraine? There's [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=457.59999999999997s)]
*  most of the party I think wants nothing to do with that anymore. How, what kind of saber rattling [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=463.03999999999996s)]
*  should we be doing about Iran? You know, there's a large strain that believes none. We should be [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=467.6s)]
*  focused on China and we should stop demonizing Iran and Russia and keep our eye on our biggest [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=472.48s)]
*  threat. I know you think they're our biggest threat as well. So how, just give me the 30,000 [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=476.96000000000004s)]
*  foot level view of how you're going to navigate that fraction. Well, I think we spend a lot of [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=481.68s)]
*  time in American politics debating tactics, like what we're going to do, who we're going to sanction, [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=486.72s)]
*  what letter we're going to send or whatever. I think it really has to start with strategy. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=490.64000000000004s)]
*  What is the strategic objective? What's the purpose, the mission? And I think the mission [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=494.24s)]
*  of American foreign policy, and this may sound sort of obvious, but I think it's been lost. The [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=498.40000000000003s)]
*  interest of American foreign policy is to further the national interest of the United States of [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=502.88s)]
*  America, right? I mean, every time. Well, and that's the way the world has always worked. The way the [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=506.72s)]
*  world has always worked is that the Chinese will do what's in the best interest of China. The Russians [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=511.2s)]
*  will do what's in the best interest of Russia. You know, the Chileans are going to do what's in the [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=514.96s)]
*  best interest of Chile. And the United States needs to do what's in the best interest of the [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=518.8s)]
*  United States. Where our interests align, that's where you have partnerships and alliances. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=522.32s)]
*  Where our differences are not aligned, that is where the job of diplomacy is to prevent conflict [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=527.2800000000001s)]
*  while still furthering our national interest and understanding they're going to further theirs. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=533.2800000000001s)]
*  And that's been lost. And I think that was lost at the end of the Cold War because we were the [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=537.2800000000001s)]
*  only power in the world. And so we assume this responsibility of sort of becoming the global [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=540.72s)]
*  government in many cases, trying to solve every problem. And there are terrible things happening [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=545.5200000000001s)]
*  in the world. There are. And then there are things that are terrible that impact our national [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=549.76s)]
*  interests directly. And we need to prioritize those again. So it's not normal for the world to [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=554.64s)]
*  simply have a unipolar power. That was not, that was an anomaly. It was the product of the end of [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=560.3199999999999s)]
*  the Cold War. But eventually you were going to reach back to a point where you had a multipolar [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=564.88s)]
*  world, multi great powers in different parts of the planet. We face that now with China and to [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=569.12s)]
*  some extent, Russia. And then you have rogue states like Iran and North Korea you have to deal [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=575.12s)]
*  with. So now more than ever, we need to remember that foreign policy should always be about [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=580.0s)]
*  furthering the national interest of the United States and doing so to the extent possible, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=585.28s)]
*  avoiding war and armed conflict, which we have seen two times in the last century be very costly. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=590.32s)]
*  They're celebrating the 80th anniversary this year of the end of the Second World War. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=596.8s)]
*  You know, that, that I think if you look at the scale and scope of destruction and loss of life [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=601.76s)]
*  that occurred, it would be far worse if we had a global conflict now and life on the planet. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=607.6800000000001s)]
*  It sounds like hyperbole, but that's how you have multiple countries now who have the capability to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=612.96s)]
*  end life on earth. And so we need to really work hard to avoid armed conflict as much as possible, [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=617.36s)]
*  but never at the expense of our national interests. So that's the tricky balance. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=624.4s)]
*  So I think returning us to that, now you can have a framework by which you analyze not just [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=627.44s)]
*  diplomacy, but foreign aid and who we line up with and the return of pragmatism. And that's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=632.48s)]
*  not an abandonment of our principles. I'm not a fan or a giddy supporter of some horrifying human [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=638.6400000000001s)]
*  rights violator somewhere in the world. By the same token, diplomacy has always required us [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=644.1600000000001s)]
*  and foreign policy has always required us to work in the national interest, sometimes in cooperation [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=649.9200000000001s)]
*  with people who we wouldn't invite over for dinner or people who we wouldn't necessarily [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=656.08s)]
*  ever want to be led by. And so that's, that's a balance, but it's the sort of pragmatic and [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=660.48s)]
*  mature balance we have to have in foreign policy. How do you think we did in the last [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=664.64s)]
*  administration? Because Jake Sullivan, former national security advisor, now former under [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=669.6s)]
*  Joe Biden said, our alliances are now stronger as they left office, our adversaries and our [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=674.08s)]
*  competitors are weaker, Russia's weaker, Iran's weaker, China's weaker. And all the while we kept [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=678.72s)]
*  America out of wars. What's your response to that? Well, a couple of points. The first is, [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=683.76s)]
*  and we're looking forward and moving forward, but we have to analyze where we stand and what the [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=687.52s)]
*  world that we inherited. And I would disagree with that assessment. I think it really begins [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=690.96s)]
*  because the Biden administration, from my view, had internal fractures between state department [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=694.56s)]
*  and the national security council, between different elements of their party. You saw that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=699.04s)]
*  come to fruition, for example, with our position on Israel, where you had a group that, you know, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=703.52s)]
*  wanted to head in a different direction. That's really a fracture within the Democratic Party as [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=708.24s)]
*  well. If you look around the world, I would say that in many cases, our adversaries are stronger [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=711.68s)]
*  than they've ever been and became stronger over the last four years. Certainly Russia does not [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=718.4s)]
*  consider itself weaker than it were four years ago. They now control territory they didn't have [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=722.7199999999999s)]
*  when Donald Trump left office. I think if you look at the Middle East, we had the outbreak of a war [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=726.9599999999999s)]
*  that can, that's been incredibly costly and divisive. It started on October 7th when these [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=732.0s)]
*  savages came across and committed these atrocities. They have a war in Europe as well, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=737.28s)]
*  Ukraine, as I mentioned a moment ago. So we had the, and I think really one of the lynchpins that [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=742.16s)]
*  sort of triggered all of that was that chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan. I think that sent a [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=746.88s)]
*  very clear signal to someone like Vladimir Putin that America was actually in decline or distracted. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=752.3199999999999s)]
*  We can move. And he did. I think you see it in the Indo-Pacific, where every day, it's not just [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=758.24s)]
*  Taiwan, it's the Philippines are being aggressively challenged by the Chinese militarily [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=763.12s)]
*  where coercion is spreading throughout the world. The Chinese are using coercive tactics, [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=768.48s)]
*  not just in their near abroad, but in other parts of the world as well. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=772.8s)]
*  So I don't agree with that assessment. I think we have a lot of work to do. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=777.2s)]
*  And I'm going to tell you, and this is something that's not often appreciated enough, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=781.04s)]
*  countries will openly complain about the U.S. being very firm and being engaged in these things [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=784.88s)]
*  in a very firm way, but privately, in many cases, they welcome it. They welcome U.S. engagement. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=790.64s)]
*  They want clarity in our foreign policy. And then they want us to take action to be reliable. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=795.76s)]
*  And I know of no president, certainly in modern American history, who's more clear than Donald [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=801.6s)]
*  Trump. And I know of no one who's more action oriented than President Trump. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=806.08s)]
*  And so that's what the State Department is going to reflect in how we proceed. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=809.68s)]
*  I'm just wondering, as I listen to you, whether you think Joe Biden's mental infirmity, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=813.1999999999999s)]
*  which we all witnessed, especially during his last year in office, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=817.52s)]
*  cost us anything with these adversaries? Yeah, look, both adversaries and allies [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=821.76s)]
*  analyze everything just as we do. We would watch foreign leaders and how they behave and make [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=827.28s)]
*  decisions upon that. And there's no doubt that foreign adversaries are going to look at how [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=831.68s)]
*  our leaders, not just presidents, but anybody else react and make assumptions on the basis of it. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=837.1999999999999s)]
*  And sometimes, you know, look, China's perception of America, this is China's perception of the [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=842.08s)]
*  world. China's perception of the world is that they are inevitably going to be the world's [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=847.36s)]
*  greatest power by 2035, 2050, whatever date they've set in their mind. They believe that [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=852.48s)]
*  they're on an irreversible rise. And we are an inevitable decline that the West at large, [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=857.2s)]
*  but the U.S. in specific is a tired, spent, former great power in inevitable decline. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=862.96s)]
*  And they believe that foreign policy is about managing our decline in their rise, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=869.6s)]
*  and they want nothing to interrupt it. That's how they view the West at large and the United [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=873.0400000000001s)]
*  States in particular. And so any time our leaders sort of personify their vision of our problems, [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=879.28s)]
*  it only further cements that belief that they have and frankly invites them to do things that [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=886.64s)]
*  perhaps they wouldn't do if they have a different calculus of us. And by that logic, we got safer [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=891.2s)]
*  the day Trump was inaugurated. There's no doubt I've seen it. I mean, I'm telling you that [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=895.92s)]
*  for if you look at what happened with Colombia, you know, generally speaking, if a leader had said, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  I'm going to turn back these planes, I'm not going to take them, we would have sent a note, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=904.3199999999999s)]
*  a demarche to call it, you know, complaining about it. And we would have then had a high level [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=907.92s)]
*  outreach back and forth. And we had figured this out, and it would have taken six weeks or what [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=912.0799999999999s)]
*  have you. In this particular case, we presented President Trump with options. He immediately took [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=915.5999999999999s)]
*  action. And the black channels existed, there was a lot of conversation with other figures in the [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=920.88s)]
*  Colombian government who had agreed to this. And we're trying to figure out a path to get us right. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=926.16s)]
*  But it didn't take six weeks or six months. It took six hours. Were they shocked when Trump sent [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=930.56s)]
*  out his tweet? Shocked? No, I don't think they were shocked. I think it reaffirmed what they [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=935.4399999999999s)]
*  believe about him. And that is that this is not a traditional sort of orthodox American president [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=941.6s)]
*  who is going to be tangled up by interagency, you know, impediments in our government. This is [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=949.6s)]
*  someone who's action oriented and is going to do things, actually going to do what he says. So, [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=956.0s)]
*  yeah, I mean, I don't think they were shocked. I think it was a good reminder. And look, I want to [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=960.32s)]
*  be clear, most of the people in the Colombian government are friendly to the United States. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=965.36s)]
*  They were horrified by what was happening. I mean, there were leaders of their congressional [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=969.36s)]
*  branch over there that were putting messages on X like this is crazy. Our president's a nutcase. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=973.6800000000001s)]
*  They were writing that. That's their internal politics. But I think it reaffirms what a lot of [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=978.88s)]
*  leaders believe about America under Donald Trump. And that is we are led by someone who is not very [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=983.6s)]
*  mysterious. He's going to tell you what he's going to do and he'll actually do it. And I think foreign [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=988.72s)]
*  policy works a lot better when you're led by someone like that. Now, does that make your job [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=992.5600000000001s)]
*  easier? Easier, no doubt. So you can just say, hey, look, the boss has said exactly how he feels. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=997.0400000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I think oftentimes people think there's posturing going on. Well, they don't [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1001.52s)]
*  really mean this or they're not really going to do it. I think in my particular case, I don't have [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1005.36s)]
*  to make that argument. I mean, I think they understand it. I think it's also a lot of [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1009.28s)]
*  pragmatism. Every conversation I've had with foreign leaders to the extent it's been conflictive or that [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1013.52s)]
*  we've had areas of conflict to talk about, I've been very clear in that is, look, I expect you [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1017.6800000000001s)]
*  to do what you're doing because you're acting in your national interests. And I know you've gotten [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1021.84s)]
*  used to a foreign policy in which you act in the national interest of your country and we sort of [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1026.48s)]
*  act in the interest of the globe or the global order. But we're led by a different kind of person [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1032.16s)]
*  now. And under President Trump, we're going to do what you do. And one of the terms that President [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1037.68s)]
*  Trump's like loves is reciprocity. And it's very simple, but I think people would understand it. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1041.76s)]
*  If you charge us a 50% tariff for an American product to enter your country, we should charge [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1046.8000000000002s)]
*  you a 50% tariff here. Maybe 55. President Trump likes to have leverage too. And who would not [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1051.8400000000001s)]
*  argue that that's not fair? And how can you argue against it? But that's been our policy in many cases. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1060.24s)]
*  In country after country around the world, we have no access to their markets, but their products [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1065.36s)]
*  have open and free access to ours. How can that continue? That's absurd. I think anybody [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1069.76s)]
*  who has common sense would argue that. Frankly, I think a lot of these leaders have been wondering [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1075.28s)]
*  why it took us so long to figure that out. But under President Trump, they know we have. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1079.44s)]
*  The New York Times said, okay, you guys got away with this with Colombia, but you're not going to [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1083.28s)]
*  be able to pull that trick with Russia, with China, with Iran. If you try to bully these [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1089.28s)]
*  stronger nations in this way, it's not going to go very well. Is that a fair point? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1095.36s)]
*  Well, we're not interested in bullying anybody. And we don't feel like we bullied Colombia. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1098.8799999999999s)]
*  We feel like we had a deal. Colombia signed a deal. They signed a piece of paper that said, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1102.08s)]
*  yes, send us these airplanes. And then halfway into the flight, they broke it. And so our answer was, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1105.84s)]
*  well, now we flew these planes. We had to bring them back to the United States. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1110.56s)]
*  So now you're going to come pick them up. Why are we going to pay for those flights? [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1114.3999999999999s)]
*  Because you canceled them. It's not bullying. They broke a contract that we had made with them. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1117.2s)]
*  Obviously, look, China has nuclear weapons. They're tough people. There's no doubt about it. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1121.76s)]
*  They're tough people. They have nuclear weapons. They're a great power with a large economy. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1125.04s)]
*  They're going to be a global power, but it can't come at our expense. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1128.64s)]
*  And so ultimately, when you're dealing with great powers like China, it's going to be at the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1132.16s)]
*  highest levels of their president and ours, their premier and ours, and our president. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1136.48s)]
*  And that interaction will happen in the case of Russia, the same. Obviously, there's going to be [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1140.8s)]
*  whatever happens with Russia will be a Putin-Trump dynamic. But I think most certainly, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1144.4s)]
*  sure, I mean, the world is the way you do treat, not the way you treat countries, but the way you [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1150.0s)]
*  approach a nation has to be based on the strategic balance. But I don't view that we bullied [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1155.3600000000001s)]
*  Colombia, nor do I think these articles about all they're going to turn to China. That's absurd. [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1160.72s)]
*  That's an absurd argument. I think the overwhelming majority of people in Colombia, a country I know [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1164.4s)]
*  very well, don't even like their president. I mean, this guy had an election. He would lose. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1169.0400000000002s)]
*  Well, he'd lose. I mean, he's unpopular in Colombia. I mean, that's not up to us. People there will get [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1173.92s)]
*  to vote and they'll decide who they want to lead them. But I think a lot of their people in their [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1177.76s)]
*  business class are like, what's this guy doing? This is absurd. I mean, it's normal that you would, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1181.44s)]
*  we were deporting people to Colombia, just like we deport people to every country in the world. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1186.48s)]
*  And by the way, if there are illegal American immigrants in another country, we would have to [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1191.28s)]
*  accept them coming this way. So I don't pay a lot of it. Most of the people, unfortunately, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1194.4s)]
*  that opine on, the more I have been delved into foreign policy and the more I read people who [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1200.24s)]
*  claim to know about foreign policy, the more I realize that a lot of the people we believe [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1206.4s)]
*  are experts have no idea what they're talking about. There's a large delta. What about, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1210.64s)]
*  you mentioned China. Did you recently have a call with the foreign minister? And there was a report [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1214.64s)]
*  that you were, you received a sort of warning that you needed to basically watch yourself. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1221.36s)]
*  Yeah, somebody told me that. And that's two things that the game that they play. But one is they put [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1224.48s)]
*  out an English translation and they put out a Chinese translation and they don't always overlap. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1228.24s)]
*  The call was very straightforward. And I basically said, you're acting in the best [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1232.64s)]
*  interest of China. We're going to act in the best interest of America. We're two great powers. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1235.84s)]
*  And in areas where we can work together, there's probably no problem in the world. We couldn't [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1240.08s)]
*  solve working together in areas where we have disagreements. We have a responsibility to manage [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1244.08s)]
*  it. So it doesn't escalate into something catastrophic, but be clear that we're going [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1249.04s)]
*  to do these things. I did not, at least the translator that was on the call did not say [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1252.8s)]
*  anything to me that I felt was over the top. But then they put out these games. They like to play [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1258.1599999999999s)]
*  these games. They put out these translations where it says one thing in English and then it's [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1262.08s)]
*  translated in a different, they use a different term and Mandarin. So he was warned not to overstep [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1266.08s)]
*  himself. They never said that. And if they had, I would have told them, well, I would say the same [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1270.96s)]
*  to you. Don't overstep either. And, but that didn't happen, at least not on the call, or at least maybe [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1274.8799999999999s)]
*  their interpreter didn't want to interpret it that way. But that was not the readout we got, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1279.28s)]
*  but it's silly and irrespective and irrelevant. What really matters is the decisions we make [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1283.12s)]
*  moving forward. And, you know, China wants to be the most powerful country in the world and they [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1287.84s)]
*  want to do so at our expense. And that's not in our national interest. And we're going to address it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1291.6s)]
*  We don't want a war over it, but we're going to address it. [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1295.92s)]
*  Well, that brings us, we have more on China, but that brings us to Panama, where you're about to [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1299.6s)]
*  go. And China's obviously playing a role down there. And is it one of the reasons why Trump has [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1304.0s)]
*  been saying, President Trump has been saying, we want the canal back. We never intended to give it [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1308.16s)]
*  to the Chinese. That was never the game plan. They don't technically control the Panama Canal, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1311.92s)]
*  but they do have interest down there. Can you explain it? [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1318.8000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, so they're all over Panama. A few years ago, Panama made a decision that they were going to [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1320.88s)]
*  derecognize Taiwan and align with Beijing. And with that came all sorts of money that was provided to [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1325.2s)]
*  the then president's administration for projects and things of that nature, but also Chinese [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1333.92s)]
*  investment. And one of the main investments they have is in these two port facilities on both sides [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1338.5600000000002s)]
*  of the canal and all kinds of other infrastructure, cranes and the like. And so people will argue, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1344.72s)]
*  well, that's not China. That's a company based in Hong Kong. Well, a company based in Hong Kong [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1349.76s)]
*  is the government of China. You are not a company in China if the Chinese government doesn't control [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1355.1200000000001s)]
*  you. It's similar to the argument about bite dance and TikTok, which is every company that operates [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1359.76s)]
*  from China or Hong Kong, which is controlled by China, more than ever controlled by China, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1366.8s)]
*  it's no longer autonomous. They have to do whatever the government tells them. And if the [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1371.76s)]
*  government in China in a conflict tells them shut down the Panama Canal, they will have to. And in [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1375.76s)]
*  fact, I have zero doubt that they have contingency planning to do so. That is a direct threat. So [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1380.24s)]
*  it's a technicality. But in reality, if China wanted to obstruct [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1385.84s)]
*  traffic in the Panama Canal, they could. That's a fact. And it's my view, that's a violation of the [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1390.1599999999999s)]
*  treaty agreement. And that's what President Trump is raising. And we're going to address that topic. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1394.9599999999998s)]
*  It's one of deep concern that dynamic cannot continue, not simply because we built it at great [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  cost and lives and treasure, but because it is contrary to our national interest. It is not in [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1404.08s)]
*  the national interest of the United States to have a canal we paid for and we built used as a [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1410.0s)]
*  as a leverage and a weapon against us. That can't happen. So what's the solution? Well, that's what [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1415.76s)]
*  we're going to have to talk about. And I think the president's pretty clear he wants to administer [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1420.96s)]
*  the canal again. Obviously, the Panamanians are not big fans of that idea. But we're you know, [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1424.4s)]
*  that message has been brought very clear. And there are a lot of other areas we can work very [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1429.2s)]
*  closely with Panama on. I mean, their government generally is pro-American on a number of fronts. [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1432.56s)]
*  But this is a core national interest for us. We can work together on a lot of things. And there [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1437.84s)]
*  are a lot of things we can work with them on that are very positive on migration. And they can be [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1441.36s)]
*  very helpful on all sorts of things. And I hope we'll get resolution to those very soon. But that [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1445.04s)]
*  does not in any way replace the core reality that the Panama Canal, we cannot allow any foreign power, [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1449.92s)]
*  particularly China, to hold that kind of potential control over that they do. That just can't [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1457.04s)]
*  continue. What could they do? I mean, are they these, you know, Chinese control or Chinese [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1462.1599999999999s)]
*  businesses along the canal, very large ones that could easily be turned into military facilities? [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1466.3999999999999s)]
*  Do they have to get rid of them? Do they have to like, what, what are the kinds of things we [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1471.04s)]
*  could ask for that would satisfy us? Hong Kong based companies having control over the entry [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1475.04s)]
*  and exit points of the canal is completely unacceptable. That cannot continue because of [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1480.72s)]
*  the China. And if there's a conflict, and China tells them do everything you can to obstruct [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1484.6399999999999s)]
*  the canal so that the US can't engage in trade and commerce, so that the US military naval fleet [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1489.44s)]
*  cannot get to the Indo-Pacific fast enough, they would have to do it. They would have to do it. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1494.24s)]
*  And they would do it. And now we have a major problem on our hands. That's number one. Number [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1499.68s)]
*  two, we have to talk about the fact that we built this thing, we paid for it. Thousands of people [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1503.92s)]
*  died doing this. Americans. And somehow, our naval vessels who go through there and American [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1508.96s)]
*  shipping that goes through there pays rates, some cases higher than other countries are paying or, [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1514.72s)]
*  you know, for example, a vessel from China, that's also not acceptable. It was a terrible [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1520.72s)]
*  deal when it was made. It should never have been allowed. They're going to tell you that it's set [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1526.0800000000002s)]
*  by an independent administrative entity, and not the government. That's their internal problem. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1529.2s)]
*  They'll have to figure that out. But we should not be in a position of having to pay more than [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1535.1200000000001s)]
*  other countries. In fact, we should be getting a discount or maybe for free, because we paid for [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1538.32s)]
*  the thing. They are too, like you mentioned with Colombia, is there a risk if we play too hardball, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1542.96s)]
*  we drive them into the arms of the Chinese? Well, I would argue that the canal is already in the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1548.16s)]
*  arms of the Chinese. So I mean, that's one aspect I would say. And we can't operate that way. Like, [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1552.96s)]
*  we can't operate in the world saying, well, we can't defend our national interest because [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1558.4s)]
*  if not, these countries will turn to China against us. I mean, we wouldn't allow that to happen. It [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1561.8400000000001s)]
*  would be against our national interests. So but that said, I hope we don't get to that point, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1567.6000000000001s)]
*  right? We have on so many topics have a very good working relationship with Panama and with [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1572.24s)]
*  their government. And I want that to continue. But we have a core national interest that's at stake. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1577.6000000000001s)]
*  They should understand that. And I think that they will understand that. And it needs to be [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1581.76s)]
*  addressed. And we'll do that. We'll do it in the right form. We'll do it appropriately. I'm not [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1586.48s)]
*  here to we're not here to embarrass anyone or cause internal friction or problems for them. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1590.24s)]
*  But I can assure you if it was the other way around, and that was a canal that the Chinese [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1594.64s)]
*  had built, they would be very forceful about it. So we can no longer operate in the world with two [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1598.64s)]
*  hands tied behind our back. People need to understand that Panama is not exactly about Panama. [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1603.3600000000001s)]
*  It's about the Chinese, which you've been jumping up and down about for a while, warning that [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1607.28s)]
*  people may not realize just how grave the threat is. And you said something I think was at your [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1612.3999999999999s)]
*  confirmation hearing to the effect of if China gets what it's want, what it wants in 10 years or [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1616.6399999999999s)]
*  so, life could look very different. Like maybe for us for for America. So I mean, they can today [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1622.1599999999999s)]
*  control me. We love our technology and we need it for all kinds of advances. All of that depends on [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1627.6799999999998s)]
*  critical minerals at the end of the day, ranging aluminum, cobalt, you name it. They have gone [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1633.4399999999998s)]
*  around the world buying up mining rights and they control not just the mining of it, but the [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1638.24s)]
*  refining and the production of it and the use of it for industrial purposes. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1643.36s)]
*  So I remember during COVID, everybody was freaking out because we couldn't get the masks [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1647.6s)]
*  because they were all made in China. And then we couldn't get this because they were all made in [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1651.92s)]
*  China. We had lost and given away our industrial capacity. This is even graver. This is the rare [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1655.2s)]
*  earth minerals. This is the raw materials necessary for some of the things that go into our most [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1660.64s)]
*  advanced technologies in the defense realm and in medicine. 80 something percent of the active [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1665.68s)]
*  ingredients and generic pharmaceuticals in the United States are made in China. We can't make [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1672.4s)]
*  them. So if they decide we're going to cut you off from these things, they could, we'd be in a lot [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1676.48s)]
*  of trouble because we gave away our industrial capacity on those things. That can't continue. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1681.04s)]
*  That's a vulnerability that we face and they will use it as leverage. In fact, they are already using [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1685.44s)]
*  it as leverage. For the first time ever, they have actually imposed export controls on critical [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1689.6s)]
*  minerals to damage our national security, but ultimately our technological capacity as well. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1697.1999999999998s)]
*  So it ranges topics, but ultimately, if China controls the means of production for both raw [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1703.6799999999998s)]
*  material and industry, then they have total leverage on us economically. And that's the [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1709.28s)]
*  world we're headed to. And I was wrong, maybe not in 10 years, maybe in five. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1714.9599999999998s)]
*  So, I mean, it's a dicey situation. Trump, President Trump knows all this. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1718.8s)]
*  And yet one of the top Chinese leaders attended his inauguration. He understands that there's, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1723.6799999999998s)]
*  it has to be played very carefully. We don't want to make an open hot war enemy out of them, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1727.76s)]
*  but we've been passive for too long. Yeah. First of all, one of the interesting things about [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1732.6399999999999s)]
*  President Trump is he's incredibly accessible. People don't believe this, but I mean, if you're a [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1737.6s)]
*  if you're a rank and file, not even leadership member of Congress, and you call the President [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1743.3600000000001s)]
*  of the United States, the chances are you're going to get a call back and you're going to get a call [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1747.76s)]
*  back from him. And you might get a call back that very day, maybe within an hour or two. [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1751.1200000000001s)]
*  He's incredibly accessible to both Americans and also to foreign leaders. His policies generally [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1754.88s)]
*  have been on meet with any world leader, you know, all engage with any world leader. That doesn't [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1759.84s)]
*  mean just because you're meeting with them, you're giving anything away, but he's willing to engage. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1763.84s)]
*  In the case of China, there's two things. I've just described one, which is the grave threat [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1768.08s)]
*  that they pose to our national interests. And the other is the mature realization that no matter [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1772.08s)]
*  what happens, China is going to be a rich and powerful country. We are going to have to deal [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1776.6399999999999s)]
*  with them. In fact, and I said this in my call with their foreign minister, but I've said this [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1780.8s)]
*  publicly, the future, the history of the 21st century will largely be about what happened [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1785.28s)]
*  between the US and China. So for us to pretend that somehow we're not going to engage with them [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1790.56s)]
*  is absurd. Now we should engage on our national interests. That is engagement and concessions are [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1795.6s)]
*  two different things. What's been horrifying is that for 25 or 30 years, we've treated China as [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1801.44s)]
*  a developing country and we allowed them to continue to do things that were unfair. We said, [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1806.96s)]
*  go ahead, let them cheat on trade, let them steal our technology because when they get rich, [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1811.28s)]
*  they'll become just like us. They became rich, they did not become like us. And now they want [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1815.52s)]
*  to continue to have these unfair benefits. That has to stop. And they built up their military, [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1820.48s)]
*  their military, their industrial capacity, but all over the world, their control of critical [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1825.2s)]
*  minerals. Again, I go back to them because buying up land in the United States, buying up farming [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1830.32s)]
*  land in the United States in particular as well, because they need to produce food and they want [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1834.3999999999999s)]
*  to be able to control that they're doing it because it's in their national interest. They are doing, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1837.76s)]
*  frankly, what I would do, but maybe not the human rights violations, but they are doing what anyone [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1841.6s)]
*  would do if they were the leader of China. They are acting in China's best interests. What's been [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1845.9199999999998s)]
*  missing is American policy that acts in our best interest. And that needs to return. How does [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1850.08s)]
*  Greenland fit into all of this? Well, the Arctic, which has gotten very little attention, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1855.04s)]
*  but the Arctic Circle and the Arctic region is going to become critical for shipping lanes. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1859.92s)]
*  For how do you get some of this energy that's going to be produced under President Trump? These [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1863.84s)]
*  energies rely on shipping lanes. The Arctic is some of the most valuable shipping lanes in the world. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1868.6399999999999s)]
*  As some of the ice is melting, there's become more and more navigable. We need to be able to [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1873.6s)]
*  defend that. So if you project what the Chinese have done, it is just a matter of time before, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1878.1599999999999s)]
*  because they are not in Arctic power. They do not have an Arctic presence, so they need to be able [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1882.8s)]
*  to have somewhere that they can stage from. And it is completely realistic to believe that the [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1886.3999999999999s)]
*  Chinese will eventually, maybe in the short term, try to do in Greenland what they have done at the [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1891.6s)]
*  Panama Canal and in other places. And that is install facilities that give them access to the [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1897.28s)]
*  Arctic with the cover of a Chinese company, but that in reality serve a dual purpose, that in a [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1901.76s)]
*  moment of conflict, they could send naval vessels to that facility and operate from there. And that [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1907.1999999999998s)]
*  is completely unacceptable to the national security of the world and to the security of the world and [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1913.1999999999998s)]
*  the national security of the United States. So the question becomes if the Chinese begin to threaten [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1918.7199999999998s)]
*  Greenland, do we really trust that that is not a place where those deals are going to be made? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1923.04s)]
*  Do we really trust that that is not a place where they would not intervene? You don't think Denmark [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1927.28s)]
*  would stop them? I think that's been the president's point, and that is that Denmark [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1932.56s)]
*  can't stop them. They would rely on the United States to do so. And so his point is that the [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1936.4s)]
*  United States is on the hook to provide, as we are now, we have a defense agreement with them [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1940.5600000000002s)]
*  to protect Greenland if it comes under assault. If we're already on the hook for having to do that, [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1945.44s)]
*  then we might as well have more control over what happens there. And so I know it's a delicate [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1950.48s)]
*  topic for Denmark, but it's again a national interest item for the United States. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1955.3600000000001s)]
*  So there was a conference call between President Trump and the Danish prime minister. Apparently [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1959.8400000000001s)]
*  didn't go very well. Reportedly involved some sort of a meltdown on the prime minister's part. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1966.24s)]
*  They don't want to give it up. So what does that, what options does that leave us? Because [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1973.28s)]
*  President Trump did not rule out economic or potentially military use. Well, I think President [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1978.8s)]
*  Trump's, what he has said publicly is he wants to buy it. He wants to pay for it. And how we worked [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1985.28s)]
*  on something like that, how something like that is approached, obviously has probably done better in [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1991.52s)]
*  the appropriate forums. A lot of the stuff is done publicly and it's not helpful because it puts the [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=1996.32s)]
*  other side in a tough spot domestically. So those conversations are going to happen. But this is not [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2000.48s)]
*  a joke. Like what he is saying is pretty accurate. People don't talk about it for years. We do have, [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2005.28s)]
*  this is not about acquiring land for the purpose of acquiring land. This is in our national interest [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2010.32s)]
*  and it needs to be solved. President Trump's put out there what he intends to do, which is to purchase [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2014.72s)]
*  it. I wasn't privy to that phone call, but I imagine the phone call went the way a lot of these phone [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2019.28s)]
*  calls go and that is he just speaks bluntly and frankly with people. And ultimately, I think [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2023.76s)]
*  diplomacy in many cases works better when you're straightforward as opposed to using platitudes and [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2028.8s)]
*  language that translates to nothing. So when President Trump said he might use economic or [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2034.64s)]
*  military coercion, what does that mean? Well, I don't remember him saying military coercion. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2039.84s)]
*  He did. He was asked, you know, what would you rule out? Would you rule it out? Right. I don't think [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2045.28s)]
*  he's in the, listen, he also brings to this. But he said no, I won't rule it out. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2050.0s)]
*  Because he brings to this, this is a businessman who's involved in politics, not a politician [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2054.64s)]
*  involved in politics. So he approaches these issues from a transactional business point of view. [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2060.72s)]
*  So he is not going to begin what he views as a negotiation or a conversation by taking [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2066.16s)]
*  leverage off the table. And that's a tactic that's used all the time in business. It's being applied [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2071.84s)]
*  to foreign policy. And I think to great effect in the first term, you look at the Abraham Accords, [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2077.52s)]
*  and the Democrats mocked the Abraham Accords when they were made. And then by the end of the Biden [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2082.0s)]
*  administration, they became the linchpin of a lot of what we're hoping to build on. That never would [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2086.48s)]
*  have happened had there not been a transactional approach. You look at what his envoy to the Middle [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2091.2s)]
*  East, Steve Woodcoff, has achieved. The Biden administration asked Woodcoff, they asked for him [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2094.88s)]
*  to be involved in these conversations. He has brought a businessman's approach to a very delicate [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2100.16s)]
*  and intractable foreign policy challenge and delivered a ceasefire that obviously is tenuous [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2105.68s)]
*  and has long term challenges to it. But there are hostages being released every day. That didn't [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2110.8799999999997s)]
*  happen for over a year and a half until he became involved. And that's the president's envoy, a very [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2115.2799999999997s)]
*  close friend who's brought the same kind of business approach to some of these challenges. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2119.44s)]
*  So let's look forward four years. Does the U.S. own Greenland? [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2123.9199999999996s)]
*  We'll see. I mean, obviously that's the president's priority. He has made that point. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2129.04s)]
*  I think that what I can tell you about four years without getting into specifics, because I don't, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2132.32s)]
*  you know, I'm not, we're not in a position yet to discuss exactly how we'll proceed tactically. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2136.4s)]
*  What I think you can rest assured of is that four years from now, our interest in the Arctic will be [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2141.04s)]
*  more secure. Our interest in the Panama Canal will be more secure. Our partnerships in the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2146.1600000000003s)]
*  Western Hemisphere will be stronger, will be stronger. We need to understand a lot of these [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2150.88s)]
*  countries in Central America, they're not destination sites. They are countries that migrants come [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2154.8s)]

*  That's part of President Trump's effort to shore up our borders and get rid of the illegal aliens [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2286.24s)]
*  who came under Joe Biden. Part of that's going to include, yes, Canada. He's said that as well, [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2291.6s)]
*  but also obviously Mexico. And President Trump is threatening to slap tariffs on both of them [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2297.6s)]
*  if they don't get in line and start doing some of the things that we want them to do [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2303.2799999999997s)]
*  as soon as this Saturday. They're jumping up and down saying, we want to cooperate. Let's work [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2306.88s)]
*  diplomatically before you slap tariffs on us. Where do you stand on that? Well, we've had [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2312.0s)]
*  conversations with Mexican government officials. I met yesterday with the foreign minister of [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2316.48s)]
*  Canada. I think there are two topics and they have to be separated, but they're interrelated. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2320.08s)]
*  The first is the migration, particularly with Mexico. There are parts of Mexico, [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2324.32s)]
*  many parts of Mexico, in which the government doesn't control those areas. They're controlled [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2328.88s)]
*  by drug cartels. They are the most powerful force on the ground and they are plowing into the United [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2333.04s)]
*  States. They're facilitating illegal migration, but they are also bringing in fentanyl and deadly [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2337.84s)]
*  drugs to our country. That's a national security threat and that needs to stop. So we expect their [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2342.6400000000003s)]
*  cooperation on that because they should. If it was the other way around, they would expect that as [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2348.0s)]
*  well. And that needs to be addressed. Secondarily to that is the president feels that we have a [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2351.76s)]
*  trade imbalance and unfairness with Mexico on a number of products, including agricultural products [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2357.2000000000003s)]
*  that are dumped on our markets, but also the Chinese. What the Chinese are now doing is they're [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2363.1200000000003s)]
*  creating these front companies. They're investing in Mexican manufacturing and then backdooring [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2367.2000000000003s)]
*  using the USMCA, the free trade agreement, to get Chinese goods into America. And so it creates this [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2371.76s)]
*  trade imbalance and that needs to be confronted. So when the president talks about tariffs, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2376.96s)]
*  he talks about it on two fronts as obviously a leverage and pressure point when it comes to [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2380.64s)]
*  cooperation on migration. But separate from that, it's also related to unfairness in our trade [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2386.3199999999997s)]
*  relationship. With the Canadians, obviously the border is one of the biggest, if not the biggest [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2391.2s)]
*  border, land border in the world. We share common interests there. I think they don't want to see [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2395.7599999999998s)]
*  their country filled with fentanyl either. I think if I were them, I'd be concerned that with the [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2400.08s)]
*  crackdown on illegal immigration in the United States, people would flee north into Canada. [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2405.2799999999997s)]
*  You would think we'd be able to work with them very cooperatively on border security. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2410.4s)]
*  And then there's a broader trade imbalance with them that the president wants to address as well. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2413.92s)]
*  So that's why those conversations are important. These are not hostile moves. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2419.52s)]
*  Are these tariffs going to kick in on Saturday? [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2422.72s)]
*  Well, we'll see. I mean, that's the president's decision to make. And we'll be prepared to [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2424.64s)]
*  address it from a foreign policy perspective, whatever decision he makes on those things. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2430.08s)]
*  That's his decision to make. Whether he makes it this weekend or a week from now or a month from [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2433.92s)]
*  now, he clearly wants to address both illegal migration, but ultimately also our economic [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2438.16s)]
*  interests. Who is more likely to be the 51st state, Canada or Greenland? [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2444.3999999999996s)]
*  Well, again, look, I think that we're a long ways from that point. I think the president's made his [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2449.2s)]
*  view on this very clear. And that is our interests in Greenland are endangered and that needs to be [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2455.12s)]
*  addressed. And he's willing to buy it. And our interests with Canada, particularly, I think if [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2459.44s)]
*  you go back and I think he said this publicly, he had a conversation with Trudeau and he asked [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2464.32s)]
*  Trudeau, well, what would happen if I imposed these tariffs on you? And he said, well, we would be [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2468.7200000000003s)]
*  done as a country. We would be finished. And his whole point is, well, if the only way you can [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2473.1200000000003s)]
*  survive as a country is by having a trade imbalance with the United States, then maybe you should just [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2477.52s)]
*  become a state. Right. And that was the genesis of that conversation. So we have issues that we need [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2482.0800000000004s)]
*  to address with Canada. They're good friends. I mean, we work with them on a lot of things. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2488.6400000000003s)]
*  We have a deep partnership with them. And but there are some issues we're going to need to [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2491.6s)]
*  address. But what are the risks to us? Because you've got the premier of Ontario saying we can't [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2495.04s)]
*  bring a knife to a gunfight here. If they're going to do this to us with these tariffs, we got to [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2500.64s)]
*  fight back the same way we supply them with a bunch of electricity. Let's shut it down. So [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2504.4s)]
*  can Canada shut our lights off? Well, then who would they be selling it to? Where else would they [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2509.2799999999997s)]
*  send that electricity? I mean, it would hurt them as well. They would have no market to sell it to. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2513.2799999999997s)]
*  And I would also argue that the United States and that look, that's a I don't think Canada is a [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2518.0s)]
*  strategic to the United States. I'm not comparing them to China or what have you. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2523.7599999999998s)]
*  But it brings to mind the point of energy independence and how critical that is. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2527.2s)]
*  We don't want to be in a situation you mentioned that about Canada. Imagine if in the future, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2531.04s)]
*  the argument is not Canada is threatening that. Well, who's threatening that is China who's [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2535.2s)]
*  threatening that is Russia. I mean, one of the great mistakes that were made is by unilaterally [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2538.96s)]
*  disarming when it comes to energy production by not fully utilizing our energy resources in this [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2543.76s)]
*  country. Other countries didn't follow the same line. They, for example, China today has the [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2549.92s)]
*  largest capacity of unused. They are able to process more oil than any country in the world [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2555.5200000000004s)]
*  right now. They've and they build more coal plants than anybody in the world right now. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2563.2000000000003s)]
*  They'll talk about green energy and batteries and cars, but they are using all of the above [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2567.6800000000003s)]
*  strategy on their energy. We've unilaterally disarmed on energy. They've all they've done [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2572.0s)]
*  is continue to increase their capabilities on energy because they know you need energy [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2576.48s)]
*  to fuel all this. AI alone was going to require an extraordinary amount of energy that the world [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2580.8s)]
*  right now can't produce to fuel it. Whatever country has energy resources that are cost-effective [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2585.28s)]
*  is going to dominate AI, which is going to dominate many, many fields. So I think at the end of the [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2589.6s)]
*  day, it's a reminder when you talk about Canada of why energy is a national security matter and [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2595.04s)]
*  why the U.S. must be able to have a reliable and consistent source of energy, or we are in a lot [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2599.68s)]
*  of trouble. Our planes won't fly. Our ships won't be able to sail and our economy will not function [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2605.2799999999997s)]
*  without energy. One of those issues that's become dicey within the Republican Party is NATO, which [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2609.8399999999997s)]
*  we've talked a lot about these other countries doing their fair share and doing their part. And [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2616.3999999999996s)]
*  this is why NATO has become controversial because there are many people who believe, [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2619.9199999999996s)]
*  what are we doing this for? It's I mean, it made sense right after World War II, but does it make [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2623.7599999999998s)]
*  sense today in the United States? It tends to be the dominant player. The Europeans can support [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2628.16s)]
*  themselves. They don't need the United States to be the big babysitter of the world, and it creates [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2632.16s)]
*  more opportunities for us to get involved in foreign conflicts that we shouldn't be involved in. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2636.8799999999997s)]
*  To that, you say what? Well, the president's position on NATO is the same every other president [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2641.44s)]
*  has had, and that is that our allies, many of our allies in NATO, do not do enough to provide for [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2645.68s)]
*  their own security. Every other president has made the same complaint. He's just actually been serious [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2650.3999999999996s)]
*  about it, and that's what he's pointing to. And look, it's interesting, and in fairness, [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2654.56s)]
*  Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, the closer you are to Russia, the more they're spending as a percentage [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2658.64s)]
*  of their GDP on national defense. But then you have countries like France, okay, or you have [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2662.96s)]
*  countries like Germany. These are big economies, powerful economies, and they don't spend as much [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2667.92s)]
*  on national security. Now, why? Because they rely on NATO. They say, well, we don't need to spend [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2673.2799999999997s)]
*  that much on- Us. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2678.64s)]
*  Yeah, we don't need to spend as much on defense because America has soldiers here, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2679.36s)]
*  and if they get attacked, they'll be our national defense. So we can instead spend all that money [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2682.64s)]
*  on this enormous social safety net. When you ask those kids, why can't you spend more on [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2687.2s)]
*  national security, their argument is because it would require us to make cuts to welfare programs, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2692.64s)]
*  to unemployment benefits, to being able to retire at 59 and all these other things. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2698.24s)]
*  That's a choice they made, but we're subsidizing that. So I think if you were to take the [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2702.96s)]
*  president's point on NATO, number one, they need to do more. And I do think long term, there's a [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2708.0s)]
*  conversation to be had about whether the United States needs to be at the front end of securing [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2711.68s)]
*  the continent or as a backstop to securing the continent. And if you talk to countries on the [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2717.12s)]
*  Eastern periphery, the ones closest to Russia, all of them are building the capability to be [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2722.0s)]
*  at the front end, the polls, the checks, all of these different places. And if you move further [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2726.08s)]
*  west to the richest economies, Germany, France, Spain, they don't spend enough on national [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2731.2799999999997s)]
*  security. They're relying on us to be the front stop. And that's not an alliance. That's a [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2736.8s)]
*  dependence. And we don't want that. We want NATO. We want a NATO in which we have strong and capable [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2741.84s)]
*  allies. Finland's a very capable ally. They make weapons. They bring something to the table. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2747.28s)]
*  We need more countries like that to behave in that manner in the alliance. And then it'll be [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2753.44s)]
*  a stronger alliance. And it'll be able to work cooperatively, not just in Europe, but in other [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2757.92s)]
*  challenges we face around the world, hopefully even the Indo-Pacific potentially. Ukraine's [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2762.2400000000002s)]
*  another issue that's got the party divided. You've got a lot. I'm sticking with the Republicans now [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2766.56s)]
*  because there's a whole other debate with the other side of the aisle, but who say, no, Putin's [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2772.4s)]
*  a bad actor. Russia's a growing threat. And we're doing the right thing by backing Ukraine. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2776.72s)]
*  And I would say the majority of Republicans now are against that viewpoint and think we've lost. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2781.6s)]
*  We've spent too much. It's any place from 105 billion to 187 billion. And they've lost. We just [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2786.56s)]
*  have to be realistic about the fact that Ukraine has lost. It's not going to gain back any of this [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2793.2s)]
*  ground. And we need a negotiated settlement now before we keep throwing good money after bad. And [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2797.68s)]
*  we can't afford it. We've got Americans who are suffering now. I think that's the majority view, [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2801.8399999999997s)]
*  even on the Republican side now. It also happens to be the reality on the ground. First, let me say [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2805.7599999999998s)]
*  this. We think what Putin did was terrible. Invading a country, the atrocities he's committed. He did [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2809.9199999999996s)]
*  horrible things. But what the dishonesty that has existed is that we somehow led people to believe [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2815.68s)]
*  that Ukraine would be able not just to defeat Russia, but destroy them, push them all the way [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2822.16s)]
*  back to what the world looked like in 2012 or 2014 before the Russians took Crimea and the like. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2826.88s)]
*  And in the result, what they've been asking for the last year and a half is to fund a stalemate, [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2833.7599999999998s)]
*  a protracted stalemate in which human suffering continues. Meanwhile, [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2837.68s)]
*  Ukraine is being set back 100 years. Their energy grid is being wiped out. I mean, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2841.68s)]
*  someone's going to have to pay for all this reconstruction after the fact. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2845.44s)]
*  And how many Ukrainians have left Ukraine living in other countries now, they may never return. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2848.96s)]
*  I mean, that's their future and it's endangered in that regard. So the president's point of view is [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2852.72s)]
*  this is a protracted conflict and it needs to end. Now it needs to enter a negotiation. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2856.56s)]
*  In any negotiation, both sides are going to have to give something up. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2860.96s)]
*  I'm not going to pre-negotiate that. I mean, that's going to be the work of hard diplomacy, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2864.72s)]
*  which is what we used to do in the world in the past. And we were realistic about it. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2868.64s)]
*  But both sides in a negotiation have to give something. And that's going to take time. But [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2872.48s)]
*  at least we have a president that recognizes that our objective is this conflict needs to end [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2877.12s)]
*  and it needs to end in a way that's enduring because it's an unsustainable on all sides. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2881.2799999999997s)]
*  It's ultimately unsustainable for Russia's paying a big price for this in their own economy, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2886.88s)]
*  their inflation rate and the like. But at the end, that's the president's position. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2890.3199999999997s)]
*  And it's the truth. And I think even a growing number of Democrats would now acknowledge [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2895.52s)]
*  that what we have been funding is a stalemate, a protracted conflict, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2899.7599999999998s)]
*  and maybe even worse than a stalemate, one in which incrementally Ukraine is being destroyed [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2903.6s)]
*  and losing more and more territory. So this conflict needs to end. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2907.92s)]
*  Who's the bigger problem in reaching a final negotiated settlement there? [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2910.96s)]
*  Is it Putin or is it Zelensky? There's a report out that the Ukrainians are just banking on Putin, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2915.92s)]
*  digging his heels in and becoming annoying to President Trump on this because he won't give [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2923.52s)]
*  an inch. And they're hoping that President Trump will come back over closer to their world view [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2928.0s)]
*  about Putin, about Russia, about this conflict. So who do you see as the bigger obstacle in getting [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2932.96s)]
*  a negotiated peace there? Well, I think there's the public and then there's the private, right? [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2936.96s)]
*  So in what you see portrayed publicly in conversations and what leaders say, a lot of [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2940.8s)]
*  it is speaking, they have domestic political considerations. Even Vladimir Putin, who controls [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2945.68s)]
*  media, still has to care about what public opinion is in Russia and his image and what [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2951.28s)]
*  his entire personality is built around. Why do you think he does the shirtless pictures? [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2956.48s)]
*  He didn't do those anymore. I think it's been a while. I asked him, I asked him, why do you do it? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2960.4s)]
*  When I interviewed him and he said, I give the people what they want. Well, the point is that [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2965.1200000000003s)]
*  he has got his own domestic considerations and so does Zelensky, right? I mean, at the end of the day, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2971.28s)]
*  if you imagine if you're Ukrainian, the Russians have made you suffer so much and now you're going [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2976.32s)]
*  to let them keep land. I mean, people would be upset about that in Ukraine and you would understand [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2979.6800000000003s)]
*  it. And then there's the mature realities of life on this planet. And that's where this work is going [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2983.84s)]
*  to have to be defined. Both sides are paying a heavy price for this. Both sides have incentive [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2989.6s)]
*  for this conflict to end. Both sides are in a, it's not going to end with the maximalist goals of [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2994.16s)]
*  either side. And there's going to have to be a lot of hard work done. And I think only the United [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=2999.92s)]
*  States under the leadership of President Trump can make that possible. But it won't be easy and it'll [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3004.7999999999997s)]
*  take some time, but it's certainly something I know he's strongly committed to being, to seeing [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3009.6s)]
*  happen. And then there's Israel and the return of the hostages, which still include Americans. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3013.2s)]
*  Right. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3018.72s)]
*  Supposedly we're going to get three Americans back in the first tranche, the first [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3020.9599999999996s)]
*  phase of this hostage deal. Do you believe we will? And what are we going to do if we don't? [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3026.08s)]
*  Well, I expect we will because that's the agreement that was made. And but the core [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3030.8799999999997s)]
*  problem here remains. And that is ultimately as long as there is an entity like Hamas, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3036.56s)]
*  which is, who's expressed purposes, the destruction of the Jewish state, who is willing to commit [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3041.84s)]
*  horrifying atrocities against civilians, against teenage girls at a concert and do the things that [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3048.1600000000003s)]
*  they've done and take hostage for a year and a half babies and elderly and murder and all the [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3053.84s)]
*  things that they did. That's a threat to Israel's national security. What country in the world can [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3057.52s)]
*  be expected to live alongside an enemy armed, capable and willing of committing horrifying [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3061.6s)]
*  atrocities? You can't. So I think that the ceasefire is important because it brought an [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3067.68s)]
*  end to some of the destruction and certainly allowed hostages to be freed at an extraordinary [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3072.56s)]
*  cost. I mean, we're talking about a ratio of one to, you know, you get a teenage hostage in exchange [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3076.64s)]
*  for 250 killers, Hamas killers that are released from prison. So just think about how unfair that [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3082.72s)]
*  trade is. But it tells you how much, you know, we value life compared to what the other side, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3088.24s)]
*  the Hamas animals view this. Now that said, the real challenge here is going to be what happens [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3094.48s)]
*  when the ceasefire period expires. Who's going to govern Gaza? Who's going to rebuild Gaza? [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3101.44s)]
*  Who's going to be in charge of Gaza? Because of the people who are in charge of Gaza are the same [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3106.56s)]
*  guys that created October 7th, then we still have the same problem. It is. And so now the good news [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3110.8s)]
*  in the region is in Lebanon, we have a government that hopefully will become more powerful than [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3117.28s)]
*  Hezbollah in the Lebanese government. And there's a ceasefire that was extended there that ultimately [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3121.76s)]
*  will lead to that. In Syria, a group has taken over. These are not guys that would necessarily [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3126.0800000000004s)]
*  pass an FBI background check per se. No, would not be coming over for Sunday dinner. But if there's [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3132.0s)]
*  an opportunity in Syria, if there is an opportunity in Syria to create a more stable place than what [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3135.92s)]
*  we've had historically, especially under Assad, where Iran and Russia dominated and where ISIS [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3140.8s)]
*  operated with impunity, we need to pursue that opportunity and see where that leads. And if you [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3146.32s)]
*  have a region in which you have a more stable Syria, a more stable Lebanon where Hezbollah is not [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3150.72s)]
*  able to do the things it does on behalf of Iran, a weakened Iran who's now lost all of these proxies, [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3156.3999999999996s)]
*  it now opens the door to things like a deal between Saudi Arabia and Israel, which would [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3162.64s)]
*  change the dynamic of the region. And then ultimately not make easy, but make easier [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3167.3599999999997s)]
*  resolving some of these challenges that we face with the Palestinian question and in particular [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3172.72s)]
*  with the Gaza question. So there's a lot of work to be done there. None of it is certain. All of [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3177.12s)]
*  it is hard, but real opportunities that we couldn't have even imagined 90 days ago. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3181.6s)]
*  Domestically, Trump pulled the security around Mike Pompeo, who was his secretary of state. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3186.96s)]
*  And I wonder if that, what your reaction was to that, because his defenders are saying is an [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3194.7999999999997s)]
*  outrage and that, you know, he's exposed now. Well, look, the president has the authority to make [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3199.8399999999997s)]
*  those decisions and to execute those orders. I can tell you they're all were run through the [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3205.12s)]
*  process that exists for assessing threat versus cost. That process was executed on. There was [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3210.3199999999997s)]
*  agreement that this was something that could be done. I've never taken lightly. And if circumstances [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3218.56s)]
*  change and new threats emerge or additional threats emerge, that will always be an option to address. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3223.8399999999997s)]
*  But if you look at some of it is also not sustainable. I mean, theoretically, Iran decided [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3229.92s)]
*  or things got out to that Iran wanted to continue to kill people. We would have to provide everybody [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3236.88s)]
*  a security detail. So there's a balance there. We don't want to see any Americans harmed, [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3241.28s)]
*  but those decisions about who we provide security for have to be based on a risk assessment. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3245.36s)]
*  And those risk assessments were done. And it led to that outcome and that conclusion. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3252.96s)]
*  On the subject of risk assessment, we pulled U.S. foreign aid. We paused U.S. foreign aid [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3258.72s)]
*  with humanitarian exceptions. And then there was a bunch of negative blowback on how this was [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3264.64s)]
*  stopping critical medications and other humanitarian aid that was being provided to our, you know, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3270.88s)]
*  third world allies. Now we've loosened that spigot again. So the criticism is that we got [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3276.4s)]
*  too far ahead of our skis by pulling too much too soon in which response to what you say. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3282.08s)]
*  I mean, we didn't issue a pullback. We issued a clarification. We always said from the very [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3287.2s)]
*  beginning, with the exception of, you know, Israel and Egypt, because that security assistance is a [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3291.04s)]
*  cornerstone of that Camp David Accords and the deals that were made there and are critical to [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3295.6s)]
*  that region. With the exception of that, we said all foreign aid is paused for 90 days, except for [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3299.7599999999998s)]
*  things that save lives and what was mentioned in the executive order with things like food and the [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3305.2799999999997s)]
*  like. We went back, people say, well, people, we have medicines that we've paid for and that are [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3310.16s)]
*  deployed and it's sitting on a shelf somewhere and we are not authorized to give it to people. So [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3314.16s)]
*  all right, it makes no sense for us if we already paid for the medicine not to distribute it and [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3318.88s)]
*  give it to people. We don't want to see people die and the like. But this, I think what's important [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3322.72s)]
*  is to talk about the purpose of this pause. Okay. If I went to these foreign entities, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3327.2s)]
*  $60 billion a year, if I went to these and said, okay, show me your foreign aid programs and what [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3330.96s)]
*  they do. Historically, we've gotten very little cooperation. But if you go to them and say, okay, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3335.44s)]
*  your money is stopped until you tell us what you do. Now you get a lot more cooperation. So now a [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3340.24s)]
*  process exists and that process is you apply for a waiver and everybody knows how to apply for a [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3345.52s)]
*  waiver. They know how to come forward and say, this is what our program does. This is why it's [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3350.24s)]
*  important. This is why it makes America safer, stronger, or more prosperous. This is why it's [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3354.08s)]
*  in our national interest. Now we get details about these programs and we may say, okay, the program [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3358.4799999999996s)]
*  gets a waiver or we may say, well, the program gets a partial waiver. You do five things. Three [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3364.0s)]
*  of them are critical. Two of them remain under pause. That's what it gives us the opportunity [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3368.72s)]
*  to do now. Thinking of it almost as an audit, but not an audit in which we're voluntarily asking [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3373.9199999999996s)]
*  for cooperation. I think we're now getting a lot more cooperation because otherwise you don't get [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3378.24s)]
*  your money. And so I think as the weeks go on, you will see more and more programs come back online [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3382.16s)]
*  because we've had a chance to review what they actually are. Some will be partial, some will be [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3387.7599999999998s)]
*  full, but we've got to get control of this. We have this thing that I've called the foreign aid [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3391.4399999999996s)]
*  industrial complex. All these entities around the world that are getting millions and millions of [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3396.96s)]
*  dollars from the United States, we have to make sure that it's aligned with our national interest, [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3401.44s)]
*  that we are prioritizing that and that we're spending it on things that really matter and [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3404.88s)]
*  are really producing. Like we don't want 50 million in condoms to the Palestinians? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3408.96s)]
*  They deny that that's true. The foreign, the Biden administration denies that. Well, but okay, [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3414.08s)]
*  but part of it was they may deny the number, but they can't deny that there are things that we were [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3417.52s)]
*  doing in Gaza that had nothing to do with saving lives on the short term or even helping with a [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3421.92s)]
*  ceasefire. Here's the broader point. And I don't know the, I'm rounding numbers here, but on USAID, [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3425.76s)]
*  about 11, less than 12%. Let's, let's be fair. Let's say 12 and a half percent of every dollar. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3432.88s)]
*  So 12 cents of every dollar ultimately reached the end recipient. That means the rest of the [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3439.28s)]
*  money was going to fund some NGOs somewhere, some organization. Maybe there's a justification for [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3444.4s)]
*  it. But before I stand before a congressional committee or the American people and say, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3449.1200000000003s)]
*  we sent a dollar to help this cause, but only 12 cents of it really got to the people were trying [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3453.2799999999997s)]
*  to help the rest of it went into the hands of an organization. How do we justify that? I can't [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3459.6s)]
*  justify that. I need to know answers to that. And so these are the kinds of things that we have to [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3464.0s)]
*  go through. And ultimately our foreign aid has to be a tool that we use to advance the national [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3467.8399999999997s)]
*  interest. The U S government is not a charity. It spends money on behalf of our national interest. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3472.08s)]
*  There are a lot of great causes in the world and the private sector can raise as much money as they [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3476.72s)]
*  want for those. We taxpayers are going to invest in the things that further our national interest. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3480.16s)]
*  And that's the process we're going through right now. And the pause has helped accelerate it. [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3484.7999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to wrap it up, but I do want to ask you about just a couple more things. Number one, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3488.56s)]
*  eight years ago, you and I were crossing each other on the debate stage. Donald Trump was center [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3496.3999999999996s)]
*  stage and he was insulting both of us. And things have really changed in eight years. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3501.2s)]
*  Can you talk about that evolution for you? [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3508.72s)]
*  I mean, so I love like mixed martial arts and boxing, right? And I see people go on the ring [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3510.16s)]
*  and I've never heard anyone ask a boxer, why did you punch him in the face in the third round? [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3514.64s)]
*  And the boxer would say, well, cause it was a boxing match. And so campaigns are a competitive [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3518.9599999999996s)]
*  environment and Trump, president Trump's a tough guy. And so these things are going to get rough [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3523.52s)]
*  and tumble, but there's another difference. I didn't know Donald Trump when he ran for president. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3527.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, I knew who he was, but I didn't know him as a person. Then he became president. I was in the [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3531.2s)]
*  Senate. Those were the four best years I've ever had in the Senate because we got a lot of things [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3535.6s)]
*  done working with him. I got to work around him. I got to know him as a person, not as the character [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3539.44s)]
*  chair on television, but as a person about the way he works, the way he makes decisions. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3544.24s)]
*  You learn from being around someone like that as well. The things he does on an interpersonal [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3548.48s)]
*  basis with people, the acts of kindness that are never going to be reported, the things he does for [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3552.48s)]
*  people that you're never going to hear. But that he, I've just, and over time as there's a big [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3557.36s)]
*  difference between the way you know someone and when you don't know them. And I would also say [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3562.48s)]
*  this, you know, I worked in the Senate, 99 of my colleagues, 98 of my colleagues that I voted for [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3566.32s)]
*  myself, 98 of my colleagues. These are people I strongly disagree with. These are people that [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3570.8s)]
*  have accused people who hold some of my policy positions of being some of the worst human beings [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3575.04s)]
*  on the planet. And yet on a personal level, I had to figure out a way to work with them and get along [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3579.68s)]
*  with them. And they're in the other party. So I don't understand this idea where if I'm, if a [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3584.16s)]
*  Democrat and Republican run against each other, you lose the election, you're expected to now, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3589.28s)]
*  okay, the election's over, you guys need to work together in the interest of our country. [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3593.44s)]
*  If that's expected among people that are in opposite parties, what should be expected of [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3596.6400000000003s)]
*  people that are in the same party? They should be expected to also work together. In the end, [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3600.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm in this because I want to serve my country, not because I want to be an enemy of anybody [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3604.8s)]
*  else's on a personal level. In the case of President Trump, I've worked alongside him and [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3609.52s)]
*  I've gotten to know him over the years and I hope that we've gained a mutual respect for one another [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3614.0800000000004s)]
*  as well. And so much so that I was honored to be his nominee for Secretary of State and now I am. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3618.8s)]
*  Yeah. And it's an exciting time to be here. You gave it back to him just as good and I gave him [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3623.52s)]
*  a few punches too. So we, you know, it was fair game. We were both fair game back when that was [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3628.0s)]
*  happening. It was almost 10 years ago now, that debate, that August 15 debate. I mentioned at the [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3631.76s)]
*  interview flippantly, the deep state thing. You know, it is a real concern for a lot of people [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3637.04s)]
*  that there's like a group of people at state and elsewhere who will actively work to undermine your [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3641.6800000000003s)]
*  agenda and President Trump's. Well, I think that's going to be true in any large organization. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3647.2s)]
*  You're going to have people that are not aligned with a mission, are not aligned with carrying [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3651.2s)]
*  things out. And I think I always am careful about it, not because I'm resistant to the idea per se, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3654.24s)]
*  but because I also think there are very talented people who may not agree with me on policy, [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3658.24s)]
*  but will do what the mission is. They will carry out the mission. And I think we expect that of [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3662.7999999999997s)]
*  people all the time. You know, I mean, if you think about it, I don't know who the pilot on, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3670.48s)]
*  maybe it's a terrible analogy on a day like this, but we don't know when we get on a commercial [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3674.72s)]
*  aircraft who the pilot's voted for, you know, or who they are, but I don't think they're going to [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3678.88s)]
*  harm us. I don't, you go to a doctor, I don't necessarily check their voter registration. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3682.56s)]
*  And we expect doctors to treat us well. And I think the same is true for people that work. There are [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3686.64s)]
*  a lot of professionals that work in the state department who will carry out the mission, [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3690.16s)]
*  but they need to have a clear mission. And they want the state department to be relevant again [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3694.24s)]
*  and have deep expertise on topics that we need their support. Now look, if someone is going to [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3697.92s)]
*  actively undermine the work of the elected administration, that's a problem. And I think [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3702.3199999999997s)]
*  any agency would argue that. And I think any president would argue that. In the end, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3708.24s)]
*  the state department and foreign policy is not separate from our republic. In our republic, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3712.8799999999997s)]
*  the American people elect a president. And that president is the executive officer of our country [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3717.12s)]
*  and is in charge with executing our foreign policy. And our agency's job is to execute the [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3722.64s)]
*  president's foreign policy. We don't have an independent foreign policy, independent from our [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3727.68s)]
*  republic, independent from our people, independent from the outcome of elections. And so our [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3732.16s)]
*  expectations is that no matter how people may feel about political leaders or me or the president [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3736.56s)]
*  or anybody else, their job is to execute on the policies the American people have chosen [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3740.64s)]
*  through their elected representatives. And that's what we're going to do at the state department. [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3745.12s)]
*  And I think the overwhelming majority of our workforce will comply with that. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3748.56s)]
*  It's pretty cool. Your parents were from Cuba. They immigrated here in the late 1950s, I think. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3752.16s)]
*  May 27, 1956. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3757.44s)]
*  Your mom works in a hotel as a maid. And here you are, Secretary of State, final thought on what [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3759.44s)]
*  that says about the United States of America. That it remains the only place where anyone from [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3766.8s)]
*  anywhere can achieve anything. And I think from our example is what other countries we hope will try [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3771.76s)]
*  to emulate in their own nations. And so it's a testament not just to the country but to the [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3776.56s)]
*  people of this country. And the greatest gift my parents ever left me is they never [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3781.52s)]
*  discouraged, never did my parents ever say, you can't be that. People like us can never be that. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3786.8s)]
*  They've always encouraged us to have big dreams and pursue them, whatever they may lead. And if [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3792.32s)]
*  you work hard, you can achieve what they are. For some people that dream is I just want to have a [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3796.4s)]
*  really good job and raise a family and be able to leave my kids better off than themselves. And for [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3800.24s)]
*  others, it's professional dreams as well. And I am blessed to be a citizen of the only place in [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3805.6s)]
*  human history where that's happened for so many. Those dreams have led you to this position and [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3810.96s)]
*  soon to Panama where we need you. You got an important job. Good luck. Thank you. Thanks for [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S5RJwmw1ihE&t=3815.92s)]
