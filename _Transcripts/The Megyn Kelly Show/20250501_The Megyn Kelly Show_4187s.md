# Tulsi Gabbard on Investigating the Leaks, Fighting the Deep State, and Whether She'll Run in 2028
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show. We have a very special [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=0.0s)]
*  program for you this morning, all about Tulsi Gabbard. When I first met Tulsi, she was still [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4.4s)]
*  a Democrat, and it was early on in her career. When she first came on this show, we didn't [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=11.44s)]
*  even have audio. We didn't even have video. It was an audio-only podcast, and you could [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=18.0s)]
*  hear her with the birds tweeting in the background from her home state of Hawaii, and the two [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=23.0s)]
*  of us were wondering what our next move was in life. This podcast was fledgling. She had [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=27.8s)]
*  been ostracized by the Democrats and the Democrat Party, and here we are five years later, both [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=34.0s)]
*  in very different places. She's now running at the top of 18 intelligence agencies, and [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=41.78s)]
*  I'm down here interviewing her at the office of the Director of National Intelligence. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=49.040000000000006s)]
*  So many did not want her to get this post, because while Hillary Clinton and others accused [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=54.52s)]
*  her of being Putin's puppet, etc., what crushes them about Tulsi Gabbard is she's no one's [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=61.080000000000005s)]
*  puppet. She won't be bought, she won't be bullied, and she won't be cowed in saying how she really [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=67.16s)]
*  feels by the military-industrial complex or anyone else. So we just completed a fascinating [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=74.28s)]
*  hour-long talk about so many different things. It's Tulsi like you've seen her a bit before, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=82.28s)]
*  still straightforward and moving and honest in her commentary, but in a brand new, really [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=88.64s)]
*  big role. Enjoy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=94.08s)]

*  and X. With longer daylight hours, you might be spending more time away from home, giving [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=102.88s)]
*  burglars more opportunities to strike. That's a good news, bad news situation. FBI crime [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=108.16s)]
*  data shows that break-ins are more likely during daylight hours than at night. Protect [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=112.75999999999999s)]

*  I'm so excited to be here with you. There's significance to where we are. Why? Yes. So [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=174.04s)]
*  we're sitting here in the lobby of the buildings known as Liberty Crossing, the office of director [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=181.23999999999998s)]
*  of national intelligence. This organization was formed because of the disaster of the [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=187.79999999999998s)]
*  intelligence community that could have prevented the attack on 9-11 had there been an integration [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=195.28s)]
*  of intelligence, had the CIA been talking to the FBI and all of these different people [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=202.79999999999998s)]
*  who had different pieces of information but weren't talking to and sharing that information [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=207.72s)]
*  and intelligence with each other, followed by the intelligence failure of the Iraq War [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=212.32s)]
*  that ultimately led to the creation of this organization. So we're sitting here in the [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=217.92s)]
*  lobby. This is the very first interview that's ever been done in this lobby and potentially [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=221.48s)]
*  in this building anywhere. I'm honored. It's a special day. And this is the 20th anniversary [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=228.56s)]
*  of the founding of this organization. Wow. Yeah, your role was created after 9-11. Yes. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=233.82s)]
*  As a result of all that, now you oversee 18 intelligence agencies. Can I just ask you [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=240.04s)]
*  as a practical matter? You come in, you had a background in intelligence when you were [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=244.04s)]
*  in the house. It's not like you never touched it. I was on the armed services in the foreign [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=248.0s)]
*  affairs committee. So it was interesting as a member of Congress there for eight years. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=252.16s)]
*  On those subject matter committees, I was a customer of intelligence very frequently. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=255.95999999999998s)]
*  Some of the highest levels of intelligence as well as kind of the broader intelligence [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=262.32s)]
*  that we had. And so I, at that time, experienced a level of frustration that's common if you [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=267.44s)]
*  were to ask most members of Congress in that the briefings that we received then, more [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=273.48s)]
*  often than not, were things that we had already read about in the newspaper or seen on the [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=278.52s)]
*  news the night before and just didn't get much value from it to better inform the decisions [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=282.88s)]
*  that we had to make related to our military or military operations or foreign policy decisions. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=289.28000000000003s)]
*  And that was, you know, I left Congress and my last day was January 3rd of 2021. And as [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=295.36s)]
*  I was going through the confirmation process for this job and I was meeting with the different [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=301.44s)]
*  senators, it was interesting that they expressed that same frustration to me. And many of these [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=306.32s)]
*  senators were members of the intelligence committee, which really spoke to how much [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=312.36s)]
*  work there is to do still. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=318.90000000000003s)]
*  So you show up here, you get confirmed. I mean, what's the first thing that, as a practical [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=322.04s)]
*  matter, do you say, like, let me see the JFK files? What do you do? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=326.28000000000003s)]
*  I have a long list of things I'm working through. But honestly, the first thing that I did was [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=331.16s)]
*  actually send out an email to all the people who work here and said, I'll be down here [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=337.12s)]
*  in this lobby where we are right now. I think it was at 12 o'clock. And if you're free, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=343.72s)]
*  I'd love to come and introduce myself and say hello. It was standing room only here. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=349.2s)]
*  I was grateful to be able to have the opportunity to just immediately address those who work [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=354.8s)]
*  here, intelligence professionals, analysts, people who are subject matter experts in different [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=359.96s)]
*  areas, some of the support staff who are here and kind of keep the lights on. And they gave [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=365.16s)]
*  me a very warm welcome and I laid out who I am, my background and the mandate that the [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=371.48s)]
*  American people delivered by electing Donald Trump and why I'm here, the purpose that we [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=378.36s)]
*  all are here for, to serve the American people, to ensure their safety, security and freedom, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=384.64s)]
*  first and foremost. And let me just tell you this, I got a number of notes. I told them, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=391.12s)]
*  let me know what you think is going right. Let me know what you think needs fixing. You [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=395.40000000000003s)]
*  can find my email address, you can find my number. And I started to get notes from people, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=400.76s)]
*  one of which came from a guy who has worked here since its founding. And it really, I'll [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=405.68s)]
*  never forget it because he said, not once has any other director ever come and done [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=411.72s)]
*  anything like this. And second, he said, I'm so happy that you're here and the changes [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=416.16s)]
*  that you seek to make, now I can finally breathe. So a simple gesture of coming and saying, [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=423.36s)]
*  this is who I am. I look forward to working with you to serve our country, to refocus [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=435.32s)]
*  the intelligence community back on its core mission, to get rid of the distractions, the [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=439.88s)]
*  weaponization and all of the other noise that has undermined the trust that the American [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=444.76s)]
*  people may have had long ago in the intelligence community. It just speaks to the vacuum of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=451.2s)]
*  that leadership that unfortunately has existed for so long. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=460.52s)]
*  So how do you, I have no doubt that the people in this building like you as a person, but [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=463.28s)]
*  you have to fight the deep state's loathing of your boss, right? I mean, there's no question, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=468.71999999999997s)]
*  there's a fair amount of loathing by Democrat lifers that work in these buildings for him. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=475.84s)]
*  And that's why I think we see leaks, whether it's at the Pentagon or from here, and you've [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=481.85999999999996s)]
*  had a couple and you've handled them very well and very firmly. But how do you battle [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=486.73999999999995s)]
*  that? I mean, it's like they have an agenda. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=491.6s)]
*  Yeah. Well, I'm sure there are people who work here and within the intelligence community [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=493.6s)]
*  who probably don't think or speak very kindly of me either, specifically because, again, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=499.24s)]
*  through the president's leadership and the mandate of the American people, I know exactly [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=505.72s)]
*  what I need to do here and how deep the rot is within the intelligence community that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=510.04s)]
*  has to be rooted out. So yes, bringing about transparency and accountability, shining a [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=517.8000000000001s)]
*  light in areas that haven't seen the light in a very long time, if ever, really pushing [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=523.9200000000001s)]
*  for the declassification of documents that the president has listed in several of his [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=531.8000000000001s)]
*  executive orders and reminding people here, especially in the area of declassification, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=536.8000000000001s)]
*  there's so much protection. We've got to hold on to all the secrets instead of really thinking [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=544.64s)]
*  about what is in the best public interest. And so obviously starting with the assassination [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=549.7199999999999s)]
*  documents related to President John F. Kennedy, Senator Robert Kennedy and Martin Luther King [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=554.4s)]
*  Jr. is the starting point. But there are many other areas where we have to bring about transparency [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=559.3599999999999s)]
*  in order to achieve accountability and deliver that to the American people, reminding people [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=567.0s)]
*  here every single day that the American taxpayers pay for this building. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=573.86s)]
*  Yeah, there are secrets. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=578.86s)]
*  Exactly. They keep the lights on. They are the ones who are funding your paycheck that's [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=580.5s)]
*  paying for your rent, your mortgage, your ability to feed your family. The American [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=587.5s)]
*  people are who we work for. So any other level of protectionism of like, well, we don't want [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=591.5s)]
*  the agency to be embarrassed by what we are going to expose in the truth to the American [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=598.9s)]
*  people. It's a wrong-headed mindset and speaks to the huge culture shift, the mindset shift [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=603.42s)]
*  that has to take place here. And this is the bigger thing that we are tackling here and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=610.42s)]
*  that the president is tackling and we're tackling across the entire federal government. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=615.38s)]
*  Did we learn something new in the RFK and JFK documents in particular? I didn't follow [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=619.22s)]
*  it that closely, to be honest. But my takeaway was most people thought it didn't add that [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=624.26s)]
*  much. Am I wrong? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=629.3s)]
*  I got to say, I'm not someone who has studied these over the years, so I'm probably about [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=632.02s)]
*  where you are. There were new pieces of information. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=637.14s)]
*  Did you get a briefing from somebody who said, holy God, it really was the CIA? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=640.58s)]
*  No. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=645.74s)]
*  And those who are experts on this, who've studied this for a long time, did not find [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=647.42s)]
*  what they were looking for. So yes, there was new intelligence and information that [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=653.8s)]
*  was declassified that had not ever been seen by the public before. There were new revelations [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=658.28s)]
*  that came through. But in both of those cases, and in a few days we're releasing another, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=663.52s)]
*  I think, 50 or 60,000 pages related to Senator Robert F. Kennedy's assassination because [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=668.76s)]
*  we had to go out and hunt and find those files stuck in other warehouses. But whether or [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=675.5999999999999s)]
*  not it delivers the quote unquote smoking gun, the important thing is that the transparency [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=682.04s)]
*  is there. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=689.16s)]
*  Well, it's even more reason to release it if it doesn't have anything. You must have [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=689.56s)]
*  looked at some of this and said, why was this kept a secret for so long? [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=693.7199999999999s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=697.0s)]
*  It just sends people spinning. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=697.4s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=698.8399999999999s)]
*  On the subject of documents that we'd like to see but haven't, COVID and its origins. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=699.8s)]
*  Sure you saw that just before we sat down tonight, the Chinese State Council Information [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=704.68s)]
*  Office, I don't even want to know what that is, but it sounds bad. They have determined [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=709.6s)]
*  that COVID came from us, that it's more likely than not that COVID originated in the United [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=713.72s)]
*  States and not in China. I'm wondering whether you have any dispute with that based on what [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=719.6800000000001s)]
*  you've seen over here. The intelligence community has been responsible for trying to figure [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=726.6800000000001s)]
*  out in part how this thing started. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=730.44s)]
*  So I created a special teams group, the Directors Initiative Group, that is focused on investigating [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=733.76s)]
*  a number of the president's top priorities and the things that the American people really [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=741.8s)]
*  deserve and want to know the truth about. The origins of COVID-19 is one of them. So [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=746.02s)]
*  they're actively working on that. A lot of the work that's been done is on covid.gov. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=750.96s)]
*  Have you had a chance to look at the website? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=756.88s)]
*  Trump changed it. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=758.96s)]
*  It's quite a transformation of the website for anybody watching. If you haven't seen [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=760.12s)]
*  it check it out. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=764.88s)]
*  It's the annoying website to which YouTube and all social media used to refer people [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=765.76s)]
*  with ouchy talking points and now it's been completely reversed. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=769.92s)]
*  So a lot of what's been found is already there, but the thing that we are working with Jay [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=775.0s)]
*  Bhattacharya, the new NIH director on with as well as Secretary Kennedy, is looking at [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=782.88s)]
*  the gain of function research that in the case of the Wuhan lab as well as many of these [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=791.36s)]
*  other bio labs around the world was actually U.S. funded and leads to this dangerous kind [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=798.24s)]
*  of research that in many examples has resulted in either a pandemic or some other kind of [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=804.76s)]
*  other major health crisis. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=812.0s)]
*  Let me ask you specifically because we already know that EcoHealth Alliance was partnering [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=814.04s)]
*  with this Wuhan lab to create, to do gain of function research. We just have never been [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=817.76s)]
*  able to have somebody say and it was that exact experiment that led to this COVID bug, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=822.36s)]
*  but have we gotten there? What's the new thing that you're digging in on? [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=828.8s)]
*  We are working on that with Jay Bhattacharya and look forward to being able to share that [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=833.16s)]
*  hopefully very soon. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=837.84s)]
*  That specific link? [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=839.68s)]
*  Correct, between the gain of function research and what we saw with COVID-19. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=841.4s)]
*  That would be extraordinary because just so the audience knows, if that's true, if it [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=845.6s)]
*  was Peter Dazic's research with the Wuhan so-called Bat Lady that caused this pandemic, [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=848.8s)]
*  then we did fund it. Then Anthony Fauci helped fund the pandemic. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=854.0s)]
*  The thing that he denied over and over and over to Senator Rand Paul's questioning. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=857.72s)]
*  That's right, under oath. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=863.88s)]
*  Exactly. Is it any wonder that he sought a preemptive pardon for anything during a certain [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=866.4399999999999s)]
*  period of time by President Biden before he left office? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=873.36s)]
*  Then strong-armed and smeared people like Dr. Jay Bhattacharya, anybody who came out [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=877.64s)]
*  and said, I don't know if that's natural. This actually smacks of lab. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=884.2s)]
*  The reason why this is so important is not just what happened in the past. It's because [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=889.16s)]
*  this gain of function research is happening in biolabs around the world. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=893.88s)]
*  I got attacked, and I think you saw this, we've probably talked about on your show before, [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=899.0799999999999s)]
*  when I warned against US-funded biolabs in Ukraine when the Russia-Ukraine war kicked off [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=903.0799999999999s)]
*  for this very reason. Who knows what kinds of pathogens are in these labs and if release [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=909.56s)]
*  could create another COVID-like pandemic. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=914.92s)]
*  And for that, I was called a Russian asset. You're trumpeting Putin's talking points. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=917.8s)]
*  All of this nonsense simply for speaking the truth and stating facts that, by the way, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=923.72s)]
*  are still on US Embassy Ukraine's website today about how the US has funded these biolabs in [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=928.6800000000001s)]
*  Ukraine. But in order to, my point is, in order to prevent another COVID-like pandemic or another [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=935.1600000000001s)]
*  major health incident that could affect us in the world, we have to end this gain of function [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=942.6800000000001s)]
*  research and provide the evidence that shows exactly why and how it's in our best interest, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=949.8s)]
*  the American people's best interest, to bring about an end to it. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=955.16s)]
*  Can I just ask you one other question on that? Why did the intelligence community, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=957.7199999999999s)]
*  why were they so reluctant to just say that? You know, under Joe Biden, it was split. The FBI [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=960.68s)]
*  eventually said, well, we kind of think it was the lab. The Department of Energy said lab. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=967.4s)]
*  But then the other agencies were like, no, we think more natural origin. Long past the point [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=971.16s)]
*  when it did not look like natural origin, they tested 80 or 90,000 animals. They never found [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=974.84s)]
*  this version of the virus. So what was going on with the intel community? [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=979.64s)]
*  You know, it's a good question, and I don't have a specific answer to it. But I want to point to [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=982.92s)]
*  the contrast of how in some cases, they are very unwilling to come to express a view or a certain [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=988.68s)]
*  opinion on something. And in other cases, even if they don't have decisive or conclusive evidence, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=998.2s)]
*  per se, they're very quickly to come to an assumption. This gets to the real heart of the [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1007.88s)]
*  challenge here. And the problems that we've seen is the politicization of intelligence to meet a [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1013.8000000000001s)]
*  certain objective or to influence a certain policy. And that is what has been the problem. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1019.72s)]
*  This goes all the way back to why this organization was founded. When you look at the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1026.12s)]
*  so-called intelligence that really was used to spur the Iraq regime change war and look at what [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1030.04s)]
*  that has cost our country in lives, in treasure, look at what it's cost the world, look at what [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1037.0s)]
*  Iraq is today, now essentially a proxy of Iran, when Iraq that would not have happened had that [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1043.6399999999999s)]
*  regime change war not occurred. So again, this is really what is at the heart of what needs to be [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1051.72s)]
*  addressed within the intelligence community and why leadership matters so much. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1060.1200000000001s)]
*  Just as a reminder to our audience, you were a young 21-year-old state assembly person in Hawaii, [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1065.48s)]
*  and two years after that, you signed up, you enlisted in the National Guard, and you were [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1072.52s)]
*  deployed to Iraq. So you know firsthand about the blood and treasure. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1077.0s)]
*  And I served in a medical unit, and it was with a unit out of Hawaii, an infantry brigade combat [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1081.64s)]
*  team. And my first task every single day was to go through a list of all of those who had been [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1090.92s)]
*  casualties the day before, those who were injured. I was the first one notified when there was someone [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1099.4s)]
*  who was killed in action. And ultimately to make sure that those who were injured either got the [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1103.88s)]
*  medical care they needed, that they were evacuated as quickly as possible, and then making sure that [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1109.8000000000002s)]
*  they were getting that care all the way until they got home or getting them back out into the field. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1115.3200000000002s)]
*  But every day going through this list of names and thinking about those at home who I knew, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1121.0800000000002s)]
*  because I heard from my parents, were worrying and terrified of their phone ringing and the [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1130.12s)]
*  most terrible outcome of their loved one, their husband or wife or son or daughter, brother or [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1140.84s)]
*  sister, being in a position where they have paid the ultimate price and service to our country. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1146.4399999999998s)]
*  And this is such an important thing because too often, as you know, very well covering all of [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1152.76s)]
*  these issues for so long, that you have politicians who debate whether do we go to war here or there, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1159.88s)]
*  do we go topple this government or that government, and too often it is so detached from [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1167.24s)]
*  the real consequences that come from those decisions. And we see the same reflected here [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1174.2s)]
*  at times, again, when we have people who are working within the intelligence community, [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1183.4s)]
*  who perhaps in some cases have become too detached from the impact of their work on those who are [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1188.44s)]
*  making life and death decisions for our country and the potential to either go to war or to prevent [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1199.24s)]
*  war, as President Trump is trying to do on many fronts. And you have those who are co-opted by the [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1205.08s)]
*  military industrial complex, abusing their position to feed or manipulate intelligence [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1211.0s)]
*  as we saw with the Iraq war, to start a new war. This intelligence community, the work that gets [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1218.84s)]
*  done in places like this every single day, has that power to be the fodder, the fuel, the seed [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1227.0s)]
*  that can lead to yet another unnecessary war. You're overseeing the group that could cause it. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1235.48s)]
*  Pete Hegson is overseeing the group that would have to do it. And both of you are in very powerful [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1242.1200000000001s)]
*  positions in advising President Trump about the risks and rewards. There was a New York Times [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1247.4s)]
*  article within the past month saying you, he, JD Vance, and his Chief of Staff, Suzy Wiles, were [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1252.68s)]
*  all together in urging him to not go too far on our actions against Iran, that we should not give [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1260.3600000000001s)]
*  Netanyahu what he wanted by either participating in or boldly and robustly supporting Israel bombing [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1268.8400000000001s)]
*  Iran, that that's a proxy for us and there's no way we wouldn't be heavily involved. And that is [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1275.88s)]
*  not a position the United States wants to be in. And President Trump did not do it. He did not give [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1280.92s)]
*  Netanyahu the answer he wanted. I know you're not going to get into the specifics of what you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1285.72s)]
*  advised the President, but can you explain your view of the dangers of barreling toward a potential [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1290.44s)]
*  conflict with Iran? Yeah, the New York Times article was a result of an unfortunate, [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1299.72s)]
*  unauthorized, and illegal leak of a very private conversation between the President and his advisors. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1309.3999999999999s)]
*  I won't get into the details, but it was a very robust discussion that really speaks to [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1319.1599999999999s)]
*  President Trump's care and thoughtfulness as he makes his decisions around these very serious [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1325.48s)]
*  issues of war and peace. Ultimately, what we are doing is providing the President with the facts, [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1332.28s)]
*  the intelligence. Here is what the intelligence is telling us. As the Secretary of Defense, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1341.24s)]
*  here are the options that are on the table and the likely outcomes that could occur if you go [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1347.32s)]
*  with course of action A, B, or C. And ultimately, it's the President who makes the decision, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1352.04s)]
*  and he has made it clear time and time again that his goal with Iran, first of all, they cannot be [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1358.12s)]
*  in a position where they can develop or have a nuclear weapon, and that he believes and is [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1365.0s)]
*  confident in the opportunity that this moment provides to be able to achieve that outcome [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1370.1999999999998s)]
*  through peaceful means, through diplomacy, and through negotiations. And he knows that that's [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1377.7199999999998s)]
*  what's in the best interest for the American people and for the world. On the Iran front, [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1382.44s)]
*  here's the argument that the more neocon crew makes. This is from Mark Dubowitz of Defense of [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1389.64s)]
*  Democracies, one of these think tanks in Washington that wants a hard line toward them. He recently [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1397.96s)]
*  tweeted, quote, the Islamic Republic is weaker than ever, hated by most Iranians, hammered by [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1402.76s)]
*  the IDF and Assad. Its terror armies, meaning Hamas, the Houthis, and Hezbollah, air defense, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1407.16s)]
*  missile production capability are in ruins. Never a better time to dismantle its new program [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1411.8s)]
*  and finish off the regime. Will another president blink? How is he wrong? [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1416.68s)]
*  First of all, the military option is always on the table. The President often talks about peace [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1425.08s)]
*  through strength, and he means what he says when he talks about his objective, which is also Prime [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1430.84s)]
*  Minister Netanyahu's objective. And I think many countries in the world would agree that Iran cannot [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1436.68s)]
*  be in a position to have a nuclear weapon or to develop a nuclear weapon. That is unequivocal. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1442.04s)]
*  How we get there is really the question. The President is of the mind as he has been consistently [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1447.88s)]
*  through his first term in office as he is now. If there is a way to achieve what is in our best [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1453.96s)]
*  national security interests through peaceful means, through negotiations, not blind trust, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1459.64s)]
*  okay, we're just going to believe whatever they say, not at all. Any deal that is potentially [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1465.64s)]
*  made with Iran will have to come with a very, very rigorous set of verification means. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1470.44s)]
*  Nothing like the failure that was the JCPOA that President Obama negotiated. The deal that President [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1478.52s)]
*  Trump through his very talented and exceptional ambassador in Steve Wittkopf [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1486.76s)]
*  is negotiating is a deal that will best serve the security interests of the American people. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1495.0s)]
*  Do you feel the push, Tulsi, the push of this like strong neoconstrain that's still within the [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1500.52s)]
*  Republican Party and probably in these agencies that's much more hawkish on an issue, including [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1506.3600000000001s)]
*  war in the Middle East, which we've just done for 20 years? Yeah, of course, the pressure is there. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1515.56s)]
*  The debate is happening in the public, which I think is a good thing. It's a positive thing [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1520.6s)]
*  that we're hearing from different elements. Yes, even within the Republican Party. Even if they're [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1524.9199999999998s)]
*  leaking? I mean, because we're hearing from them that way. Well, the leaks should not, the leaks [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1530.44s)]
*  have to end. If the President can't have the confidence that he can sit in a room with his [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1534.52s)]
*  closest advisors without it leaking to the public, then that is something that really undermines [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1540.76s)]
*  his being best served with the best possible information, with robust debate around the table, [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1548.68s)]
*  which you look at the team of people he's assembled, he likes that debate because he sees the value [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1555.64s)]
*  in hearing different perspectives so that he can make that best informed decision. But when we look [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1560.76s)]
*  at this debate that's happening kind of in the public town square, whether it be digital or TV [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1566.2s)]
*  or whatever the platform is there, I think it's important for the American people to see the [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1571.4s)]
*  contrast and the difference between the neocons who are very ready to rush into war without [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1577.64s)]
*  allowing what President Kennedy spoke about in his historic speech at American University, which was [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1583.72s)]
*  to choose peace, to do the hard work of diplomacy, to recognize the true cost and the serious cost [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1590.84s)]
*  of war, and that it requires strong leadership to do the hard work of diplomacy in order to achieve [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1598.84s)]
*  peace, however and wherever possible, and that it's not something that you just go, okay, good, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1605.48s)]
*  we got peace, and then you walk away. No, it requires consistent engagement and that strong [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1611.8799999999999s)]
*  leadership that once again strikes that balance and recognizes that we cannot be prosperous unless [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1616.84s)]
*  we are at peace as a nation and ensuring our nation's security. We have the strongest and [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1623.48s)]
*  most capable military in the world, and I can say as someone who still serves in the Army Reserve [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1631.32s)]
*  and has now for 22 years- You're too busy for that right now. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1636.84s)]
*  A little bit, but those who I've had the privilege of serving alongside, [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1640.9199999999998s)]
*  I had the chance to go and do some PT with Pete Hegseth and some Marines the other day. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1645.96s)]
*  You still got it? Are you still there? You know, I'm giving the kids a run for their money, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1650.52s)]
*  and I'm good with that, but it's recognizing again, yes, we have the capability to defend our safety, [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1654.76s)]
*  security, and freedom anywhere, anytime, but it takes a strong leader and a strong president [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1663.48s)]
*  to choose peace and diplomacy, recognizing that war and the use of our military because of the [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1669.72s)]
*  sacrifices of these young men and women from all across the country that is required when you go [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1677.32s)]
*  to war. President Trump takes that very seriously. I mean, I appreciate as a mother of an 11, 14, [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1683.48s)]
*  and 15-year-old, I appreciate that. I do not want somebody with their foot on the gas pedal [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1688.52s)]
*  recklessly pushing us into yet another war, and I think I speak for most people in the country on [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1693.72s)]
*  that. The leaks, we touched on it. It must be very disconcerting to be in a private meeting with [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1698.84s)]
*  the president with only top, top people, and then a day later see it on the pages of the New York [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1705.56s)]
*  Times. Clearly, I assume you trust your fellow cabinet members and so on implicitly, but everyone [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1711.24s)]
*  has to speak to a staff about what happened and what needs to happen, and I wonder how rattling [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1717.48s)]
*  that is because you're in the same position in a way that Pete Hegseth is in where people underneath [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1724.2s)]
*  you appear to be leaking even top secret information that you can go to jail for leaking, but they [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1730.28s)]
*  clearly have such an agenda, it's worth it to them. So how has that affected you? And you're dealing [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1738.28s)]
*  with it with a firm hand, but how has it affected you when this happens? You mentioned that example [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1743.16s)]
*  of that New York Times article. There were a number of things in that article that were completely [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1748.44s)]
*  inaccurate, which speaks to, again, and there is an investigation that's underway to try to figure [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1752.84s)]
*  out the source of this leak or sources of this leak around that specific incident, but the effect [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1758.9199999999998s)]
*  is, I mean, it makes things much harder in constantly questioning and looking over your [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1765.6399999999999s)]
*  shoulder, okay, who's in the room? I have to be careful about everything that I say because [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1772.04s)]
*  ultimately we're in a situation where these things being leaked either by people who are just trying [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1777.96s)]
*  to show a reporter that they're important or chasing clout of some sort, or the most dangerous [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1783.4s)]
*  of which is those who are trying to ultimately undermine the president's policies, and this is [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1792.44s)]
*  not just like, okay, we don't like Trump or someone who has a problem with President Trump and his [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1799.96s)]
*  policies, really what is happening when they do that is they're undermining our democracy, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1804.76s)]
*  because what they're doing in whatever tactic they use is saying, well, I'm doing what's best [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1809.8s)]
*  for the country, and I know what's better for the country than the majority, the vast majority of [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1816.92s)]
*  the American people who chose this duly elected president, Donald Trump, and that's where you can [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1821.96s)]
*  agree or disagree with his policies, but when people cross that line who are in the room, [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1828.92s)]
*  who are in these positions of power and influence, they are actually undermining our democracy and [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1834.12s)]
*  our security in doing so. You've referred three people now to DOJ for criminal prosecution. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1839.8799999999999s)]
*  Do you think they will be prosecuted? That's the goal. That's the goal. The only way we bring [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1845.8799999999999s)]
*  about accountability is by doing the work of conducting these investigations. The Department [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1851.08s)]
*  of Justice and the FBI obviously have different tools that they can use in order to find the truth [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1858.68s)]
*  and to seek out that evidence so that we can actually prosecute these crimes. Do the people know [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1866.52s)]
*  they've been referred? Like, do they still work here? In some cases, they know. In other cases, [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1871.0800000000002s)]
*  they are likely not aware. We have another 11 cases that we are still conducting our own internal [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1876.1200000000001s)]
*  investigations around. Some will be sent to the Department of Justice for further investigation [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1882.28s)]
*  and prosecution for criminal charges because it is a crime. It's a federal crime. And others, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1887.88s)]
*  depending on the situation, will be dealt with internally where people will be fired and have [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1894.2800000000002s)]
*  their security clearance revoked. One of the leaks was it spoke to what Trump is trying to do with [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1898.68s)]
*  the deportations, not the securing of the southern border, but the deportations. And he has declared [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1905.0800000000002s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act an invasion or incursion, in part saying that the Venezuelan [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1910.0400000000002s)]
*  government has dispatched Tren de Aragua, this gang, to come into the United States and commit [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1915.96s)]
*  mayhem. And one of the things that was leaked from someone in the intel community was that didn't [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1922.52s)]
*  happen. There is no official link between the Venezuelan government and Tren de Aragua. Therefore, [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1928.3600000000001s)]
*  it's not an incursion. It's not an invasion. It's very clear why somebody would leak that, [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1934.3600000000001s)]
*  to try to undermine the president's use of the Alien Enemies Act. Is that one of the leaks being [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1939.48s)]
*  investigated? It is being investigated. There's a few things to add to that to kind of color out [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1943.48s)]
*  the picture. One of the most often tactics that these leakers use is they will take, let's say [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1948.2s)]
*  it's a six-page top secret classified document, and they will pull a line from page one and a line [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1956.1200000000001s)]
*  from page two and a line from page three that, when put together, supports the narrative that [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1963.32s)]
*  they are trying to push, but is not at all reflective of the kind of conclusive analysis [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1969.24s)]
*  in that report. And that's exactly what happened in this case. So they very selectively and [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1977.64s)]
*  intentionally left out what was really the most important thing, which was that the FBI very [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1984.92s)]
*  clearly is the intelligence element that is responsible for domestic security. So it shouldn't [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1990.36s)]
*  be a surprise then that they are the element that said yes, the Maduro Venezuelan government [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=1996.68s)]
*  is supporting Tren de Aragua and their criminal activities here, enabled by President Biden's [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2004.3600000000001s)]
*  four years of open borders, where they very freely came in and out of our country and were able to [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2010.6000000000001s)]
*  begin to control territory here in the United States. The CIA doesn't collect intelligence [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2016.6000000000001s)]
*  here in the United States because that is not within their writ or their authorities. So again, [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2023.08s)]
*  this is where we look at the ways that intelligence leaks are politicized is by the selective picking [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2030.9199999999998s)]
*  and choosing and very clearly leaving out the thing that actually supports what the president [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2036.76s)]
*  is doing here. I'm listening to you. I'm rolling my eyes at the thought of a judge trying to [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2043.8s)]
*  overrule effectively you and President Trump on whether it's been an incursion, on whether the [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2052.6s)]
*  intel supports this link without having any access to any of these materials. I mean, when you see the [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2060.8399999999997s)]
*  courts really trying to get involved in this and seeming to be on a road towards saying we are [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2068.04s)]
*  allowed to declare whether there is an incursion or they're not, what's your reaction? I mean, [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2073.88s)]
*  it's such a dangerous thing and again, it's preposterous in my view that these judges, [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2079.24s)]
*  the judicial branch obviously plays an important role in our three, you know, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2084.52s)]
*  co-equal branches of government, but they should understand what their role is. And these activist [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2088.2799999999997s)]
*  judges who now somehow believe that they're in the position of making policy by undermining [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2093.56s)]
*  the president's legal authorities and orders bestowed upon him by the American people. He did [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2099.4799999999996s)]
*  the hard work and put his name on the ballot and ran for office. If these judges want to run for [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2106.2s)]
*  office and be president, go ahead and do that. Go make your policies. Go state your views and [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2110.6s)]
*  your opinions. But they are politicizing the bench and, you know, showing how through their activism [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2115.72s)]
*  they are undermining really frankly their own credibility in doing this. And again, [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2123.56s)]
*  another thing that undermines the American people's faith and trust that these institutions, that the [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2128.3599999999997s)]
*  judicial branch in some of these cases is actually doing their job. You do a presidential daily brief [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2134.6s)]
*  every day. You don't do a judicial daily brief every day. You don't sit with Judge Boasberg or [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2141.08s)]
*  the U.S. Supreme Court and tell them all the things that he hears. That's what's so absurd. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2146.04s)]
*  It's crazy. One more thing I'll add on that because you mentioned of leakers within the [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2150.68s)]
*  intelligence community. Unfortunately, we have them and they have been there for far too long [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2155.64s)]
*  and we are trying to root them out. But there's also another source of leaks in coming from [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2160.76s)]
*  Congress where certain staffers and members of Congress have access to this very same intelligence. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2167.0800000000004s)]
*  And as you can imagine, some may find it in their interest to selectively leak intelligence, once [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2174.92s)]
*  again, to support the talking points that they are delivering that are undermining the president's [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2182.2000000000003s)]
*  actions to root out these cartels and these gangs to keep the American people safe. [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2188.7599999999998s)]
*  When we just take a step back and look at the arguments that many of these Democrats in Congress [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2196.04s)]
*  are making and how hard they are fighting and these judges, it makes zero sense. In really, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2201.08s)]
*  President Trump's mission is very clear. We are trying to make our country safe. We're getting [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2208.04s)]
*  rid of the most dangerous of gangs and criminals and cartels. How is this not the most bipartisan [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2212.36s)]
*  issue that exists in the country? They say they need due process. They need more due process. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2219.48s)]
*  Right. But not when they illegally came across the border. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2222.52s)]
*  We didn't get any. You guys have been helping with that. I want to ask you about this. [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2227.08s)]
*  This is the National Counterterrorism Center's border security has actually helped President [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2231.08s)]
*  Trump quite a bit in nabbing a bunch of these gang members, from what I can see, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2237.24s)]
*  leads on approximately 750 individuals in the U.S. who have ties to some of these gangs like [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2243.3199999999997s)]
*  Trenda, Aragwa, MS-13, and also the Sinaloa cartel. Can we spend some time, let's first speak about [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2248.52s)]
*  that, and then let's spend some time on the cartels, which I saw you recently listed as your number one [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2255.7999999999997s)]
*  security concern above Iran, above China, above Russia, the cartels. So let's do it in that order. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2261.96s)]
*  Sure. The winds at the border and how you guys are helping. So as we started the conversation, [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2269.2400000000002s)]
*  we talked about why this organization exists. The ODNI exists to be that integrating element, [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2273.96s)]
*  pulling together information in this case from the DEA, who's been focused on these cartels for a [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2280.44s)]
*  very long time because of their counter-narcotics trade. The intelligence that the FBI has collected [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2285.56s)]
*  is they're looking at the criminal activities that these cartels are conducting right here [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2291.24s)]
*  in communities all across the country. You look at the databases that we already have in place, [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2295.3999999999996s)]
*  and have had in place for a very long time, in being able to keep track of known and suspected [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2302.04s)]
*  Islamist terrorists from different parts of the world who may be trying to come into our country. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2309.0s)]
*  Or did come in under Biden. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2314.2s)]
*  Well, that's exactly the point. And so this is kind of the nucleus for all of the intelligence [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2315.88s)]
*  and information that's being collected about all these different individuals. And it allows us, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2322.44s)]
*  our National Counterterrorism Center, great people who work there. They deliver almost every day on [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2327.1600000000003s)]
*  keeping the American people safe. In some of the examples that you mentioned of providing information [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2333.48s)]
*  on these over 750 individuals who we know are members of these three major cartels. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2340.44s)]
*  Just yesterday, identifying almost 600 people who are known or suspected terrorists, who illegally [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2348.36s)]
*  came into our country, who applied for asylum under Joe Biden's administration, and who were [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2355.7200000000003s)]
*  then released out into our country. And so being able to get their names and work with the FBI, [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2361.2400000000002s)]
*  work with the Department of Homeland Security, for the cartels working with the DEA, so that we [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2367.72s)]
*  can find them and either prosecute them or immediately deport them and get them out of our [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2373.24s)]
*  country. And to stop them from entering into our country in the first place, either by legal or [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2378.52s)]
*  illegal means. Before we get to the cartels, what's your level of confidence? And you can't [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2385.0s)]
*  speak for DHS, but within the intel community, the ones that you guys are identifying, what's [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2389.48s)]
*  your level of confidence that they actually are gang members or cartel members? Because some of [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2394.44s)]
*  the public have been led to believe it's very willy-nilly, you're picking up random hairdressers [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2400.12s)]
*  and deporting them. How high is the bar before you communicate to the Tom Homans of the world? [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2406.04s)]
*  It's this one and that one and the other one. When it's by the time it comes to us here at [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2412.68s)]
*  our National Counterterrorism Center, extensive work has already been done by the DEA, by the FBI, [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2417.48s)]
*  in order for their names to even be entered into our system. So my level of confidence is high [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2425.56s)]
*  because it's high because of the work that I know that these DEA agents are doing, that these FBI [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2431.48s)]
*  agents are doing. My office as the Director of National Intelligence, we have 12 regional [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2438.36s)]
*  representatives all across the country and I've been spending time getting out to them [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2444.84s)]
*  and having conversations not only with them, and it's usually the FBI Special Agent in charge of [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2450.2000000000003s)]
*  that FBI office, but we have people from every element of the intelligence community, every [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2454.76s)]
*  element of, you know, Department of Homeland Security, DEA, all of the domestic law enforcement [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2460.6s)]
*  agencies, and they are working together as a team sharing that information, working together [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2467.4s)]
*  on these cases to be able to identify who these people are and ultimately to track them down and [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2474.36s)]
*  deport them or arrest and prosecute them. On the subject of the cartels, fentanyl remains the [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2479.08s)]
*  number one killer of Americans. I think it's 18 to 44 now. I mean, it's not just the super young, [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2487.4s)]
*  it's like those are the main years of your life. That's when you're totally thriving, [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2494.04s)]
*  you're making a family. Number one killer, and we just did a long special on this the other day [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2497.72s)]
*  because yesterday was National Fentanyl Awareness Day, and we were talking with these documentary [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2503.64s)]
*  makers about how they'll flood the border on one side so that the border agents will go over here [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2508.84s)]
*  and then they'll send the fentanyl over on screen right where nobody's covering it because that's [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2514.6s)]
*  their main goal is to get the fentanyl into a country that's desperate for it where we have [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2519.72s)]
*  some, we're 4.5 percent of the world and we're 40 percent of the fentanyl consumers. So it's crazy. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2523.64s)]
*  Sounds good, taking on the cartels, evil, very dangerous. Also sounds like a nightmare of a [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2534.12s)]
*  never-ending war that could turn into some sort of homegrown terrorism problem here in the United [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2542.12s)]
*  States. So how do you calculate the risks here? Well, first of all, it's, I mean, it's already [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2548.28s)]
*  happening. These cartels are already finding their emplacements here, having their own version of a [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2554.76s)]
*  headquarters in different cities and towns across the country. The capabilities of these cartels, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2563.0s)]
*  we are not underestimating at all. It is quite an eye-opening thing when we look at how their [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2570.6s)]
*  operations are running and their capabilities, and I won't go into detail here, but it really [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2580.92s)]
*  speaks to why President Trump recognized this as this greatest domestic threat, which goes back [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2586.36s)]
*  to the annual threat assessment and where I detailed this and why, and also how the Department [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2593.88s)]
*  of Defense is now working with Department of Homeland Security really to secure our border [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2600.84s)]
*  and will play an integral role in going after and defeating these cartels, working very closely [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2606.76s)]
*  with Mexico and their government. Can you just speak to, it's not just coming from the southern [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2614.76s)]
*  border, right? Now they're going around, they're using the northern border, they're sending, [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2621.64s)]
*  they're shipping things in from the west coast, the east coast. I mean, it's, we like to think [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2626.92s)]
*  of ourselves as isolated, but we're really not that isolated from these cartels. That's right, [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2631.72s)]
*  and that's where taking this very expansive approach all at once is so essential. No one is [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2636.52s)]
*  naive at all in thinking that this is just going to be like, oh, we'll conduct a few operations and [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2645.56s)]
*  just knock this all out, but also thinking through very carefully kind of the lessons learned from [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2650.04s)]
*  the last war on drugs that ultimately ended up just being a prolonged war that we never really [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2657.96s)]
*  saw much progress on. There's a lot of talk about government debt, but after four years of inflation, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2665.56s)]
*  another real crisis is personal debt. Some people are working harder than ever and still [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2675.8s)]
*  drowning in credit card debt and overdue bills, but then you can look to done with debt. Done with [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2680.36s)]
*  debt has unique escape strategies designed to help end your debt fast so you keep more of your hard [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2686.44s)]
*  earned money. Done with debt does not try to sell you a loan or bankruptcy. Their tough negotiators [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2691.7200000000003s)]
*  go one-on-one with your credit card and loan companies with one goal, to drastically reduce [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2696.6800000000003s)]
*  your bills, eliminate interest, and erase penalties. Most clients end up with more money in their [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2702.12s)]
*  pocket month one, and they don't stop until they break you free from debt permanently. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2707.56s)]
*  Take a few minutes and visit donewithdebt.com. Speak with one of their strategists. It's free, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2711.72s)]
*  but listen up. Some of their solutions are time sensitive, so you will need to move quickly. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2717.0s)]
*  Go to donewithdebt.com. That's donewithdebt.com. Picture this. A lady named Phyllis walks into a [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2720.84s)]
*  neighborhood pharmacy in New Jersey. She asks the pharmacist for an antioxidant cream for her [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2728.6s)]
*  wrinkles. The pharmacist says, I'll compound one for you. Come back tomorrow. It's already promising. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2733.64s)]
*  Phyllis uses the cream for three days, goes to her dermatologist appointment, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2739.0s)]

*  struck this deal with the Ukrainians for a minerals deal where we're going to have access [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2810.84s)]
*  to some of their rare earth materials. And it's not necessarily a repayment for all of the [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2817.16s)]
*  aid that we've given them, but it gives us a reason to be involved in Ukraine, to look out [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2824.04s)]
*  for Ukraine, and President Trump thinks it'll be a deterrent to Putin in starting things back up [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2828.76s)]
*  again if he's able to put this to bed. The critics say, these are former Biden people, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2834.1200000000003s)]
*  there's nothing to be gained in Ukraine. They don't have the rare minerals that we need. That's why [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2840.84s)]
*  we're all buying the stuff from China to begin with. So we've bought a pig in a poke. What do you say? [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2845.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't know why they can't find a single thing that they can agree with the president on. Not [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2852.0400000000004s)]
*  a single thing. You know, this deal was very important to the president to get done, and today [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2857.32s)]
*  was a big day. A lot of work went into getting this deal signed today because he values the fact [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2865.4s)]
*  that, as he talked about earlier in the cabinet meeting today, about how the American taxpayer [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2873.32s)]
*  has provided overall when you look at all of the aid that's been given to Ukraine since the Russia- [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2878.28s)]
*  Ukraine war started, $350 billion. And when you look at some of the deals that some of the other [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2884.04s)]
*  European countries made with the aid they provided with Ukraine, A, either they used frozen Russian [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2889.56s)]
*  money, so they weren't using their taxpayer dollars, they found a way to give them frozen [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2895.4s)]
*  money from Russian funds, and in other areas, they said, okay, we'll loan you this money and [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2901.88s)]
*  we'll figure out a payback plan for the future. But not us, not the Biden administration. This [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2907.4s)]
*  money was just given and that's it. So President Trump understood that, was very, very, very [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2914.92s)]
*  bothered by it, that the American people are just out of pocket on this without any means of [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2923.4s)]
*  of any kind of repayment whatsoever. And so this Minerals Deal is a way for the American people [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2929.56s)]
*  to get some form of- not return, but some kind of a repayment based on the taxpayer dollars that [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2938.12s)]
*  have been expended and used to pay for someone else's government to be run, to pay for someone [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2945.48s)]
*  else's infrastructure, even outside of all of the weapons system, while we still have communities [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2951.32s)]
*  here who have failing infrastructure, who have poisonous water, who have people still in western [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2955.8s)]
*  North Carolina who are homeless and don't have the basic needs that they have. And so this deal, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2962.36s)]
*  yes, of course, he wouldn't have made the deal if they don't have these rare earth and minerals [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2970.44s)]
*  that still need to be mined, but of course we checked. He's not going to go and make a blind [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2976.44s)]
*  deal based on just a handshake. And so this is a win for the American people and it's a win for [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2983.4s)]
*  the Ukrainian people because this joint partnership is something that is mutually beneficial for the [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2989.56s)]
*  people of both of our countries. You think about the things we could have used some of that money [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2994.2000000000003s)]
*  for with all due respect to the Ukrainians. I mean we're talking about the southern border, [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=2998.12s)]
*  how porous it is, more agents, maybe at the northern border more agents, maybe to inspect [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3002.52s)]
*  some of the cargo that gets shipped in, maybe some treatment programs for people who get addicted [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3007.48s)]
*  to this poison and will be dead if you play the odds within 18 months, maybe more immigration [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3011.48s)]
*  judges so we can give all that due process the Democrats want us to give. You know, like there's [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3017.88s)]
*  so many other ways we could have spent that money. So I want to go back on, you remember the tragic [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3022.92s)]
*  wildfire that hit my home community of Lahaina. I didn't live there, but it was within my district [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3030.2s)]
*  when I was in Congress and how many lives were lost and an entire town just razed to the ground. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3036.68s)]
*  And when I went there just a couple of days after that fire happened and went out and talked to the [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3045.08s)]
*  people there on West Maui and the fact that so many of them not connected to each other, [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3050.52s)]
*  completely different conversations, different households, different locations said gosh, [[00:50:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3057.0s)]
*  if only we were Ukraine, maybe somebody would pay attention to us. And that just speaks to what [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3062.04s)]
*  we're talking about here. And so this is this community of Lahaina now who is only now, by the [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3069.24s)]
*  way, just starting to rebuild homes in communities and in places where they have lived for generations. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3074.36s)]
*  We talk about western North Carolina and the very, very, very slow rebuild process that's going on [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3082.2s)]
*  there, that people who lost their homes are still paying property taxes and mortgages [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3088.2s)]
*  for the land and the home that they have that they are not able to to live on in any way at all. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3093.96s)]
*  You look at... I don't think I'd do it. Well, I don't think I'd be doing it. That's the thing is [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3100.6s)]
*  those are two of many examples. You have a level of poverty in West Virginia that I think many [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3107.56s)]
*  Americans would not see if but going to a third world country on the other side of the planet. [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3114.6s)]
*  The needs that we have here are very real and part of the dissatisfaction that the American people [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3121.96s)]
*  have had for so long in our government is that the government, by and large, FEMA is a great example. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3127.64s)]
*  You take all of this money, so much of this money, and it feeds into this bureaucracy and you have [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3132.7599999999998s)]
*  all these officials going to places like western North Carolina. I went there and you hear the [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3138.2799999999997s)]
*  angst in people's voices when they say, no, FEMA hasn't been here, and they're hoarding supplies [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3143.56s)]
*  here or there. They're saying, hey, here you go, here's 500 bucks. What a freaking insult that is. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3148.52s)]
*  And then they see what's going on with, oh, we sent another 50 billion to Ukraine today and then [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3154.92s)]
*  next, oh, we sent another 100 billion and how people are celebrating that when they're not even [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3160.52s)]
*  looking at what's happening in our own backyard. And this is what I saw and experienced when I was [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3166.04s)]
*  helping President Trump during his election campaign was that there was a spark of hope [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3170.76s)]
*  in people's hearts when they saw that he was addressing the very things that they were most [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3177.6400000000003s)]
*  concerned about. Their health and well-being, securing our borders, not allowing boys to play [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3183.32s)]
*  in girls' sports or allowing them into girls' bathrooms, things that are common sense and [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3189.32s)]
*  address the everyday needs of the American people, our security, him being the president of peace [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3195.5600000000004s)]
*  and trying to prevent war. This is a shift. This is the beginning of a shift to what we are all [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3200.52s)]
*  seeking to bring about, which is in this 250th anniversary of the founding of our country, [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3208.7599999999998s)]
*  how about let's have a government that actually serves the people, a government that is of, by, [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3213.8s)]
*  and for the people. We were talking about Russia briefly. You and I have talked before about how [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3219.96s)]
*  Hillary Clinton labeled you a puppet of Putin, a Russian asset. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3224.44s)]
*  shamefully, said the same. And I saw recently President Trump withdrew Hillary Clinton's [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3230.76s)]
*  security clearance, which you had to do. That must have been a little fun. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3237.7200000000003s)]
*  Right? Just a little fun. I smiled. Of course you did. You're only human. Yeah, I am. So yeah, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3243.16s)]
*  that's over for her. And a number of other people, by the way, when you look at the 51— [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3252.36s)]
*  Mark Zaid, former intelligence officials who signed that Hunter Biden disinformation letter [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3257.8s)]
*  and never apologized for it, never held themselves accountable for it. [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3263.8s)]
*  Yes, Mark Zaid, you had Letitia James and others. Why does she even have one? Well, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3267.56s)]
*  some of them didn't have clearances, but they had access to classified information. And so we took [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3272.6s)]
*  away that access for those— Yeah, Alvin Bragg didn't have clearances. Yes. [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3277.64s)]
*  Okay. And there are more to come. And this is part of what we're doing in our investigative work. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3282.04s)]
*  As we go back and look, for example, at Crossfire Hurricane and how there were assistant U.S. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3287.8799999999997s)]
*  attorneys who were knowingly using manufactured testimony, that they would interview a witness, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3293.7999999999997s)]
*  for example, and know that the witness was lying to them, either because they set up the lie [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3302.2799999999997s)]
*  or they knew that the witness was lying, took that lie and used it as evidence to get a warrant [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3307.56s)]
*  under FISA to go and surveil on Americans, which is completely illegal. And so these are the kinds [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3313.24s)]
*  of things those types of people, those assistant U.S. attorneys or those FBI agents that were [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3322.2s)]
*  involved in this kind of stuff, these are crimes that need to be prosecuted and these people need [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3328.7599999999998s)]
*  to be held accountable. Will that happen? That will happen. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3334.76s)]
*  Wow. I mean, it's called the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That's right. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3338.28s)]
*  That's what it's supposed to be used for. Yeah, it's a good reminder. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3341.88s)]
*  Yeah. On the subject of saving money, you're doing some of that right here. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3343.5600000000004s)]
*  Yes. And in part, it relates to enacting President Trump's DEI directives and pulling back on some of [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3348.1200000000003s)]
*  the nonsense that I know you and all the other agencies were spending money on, not you, you, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3355.1600000000003s)]
*  but the intel community. Can you speak to a little bit of what you found? Because you're [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3359.88s)]
*  doing your own DOJ. You're doing DIG. Yes. So that's under you. You didn't out. So this is [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3364.52s)]
*  not one of the areas that Elon and DOJ came into. You did it on your own. And I understand why. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3370.04s)]
*  They are helping us. They have incredible tools and a lot of lessons learned through the work [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3374.68s)]
*  that they've done. And so they are helping us and allowing us the opportunity to be able to apply [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3378.44s)]
*  those here. So we're not trying to reinvent the machine at all. And we're able to get after the [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3383.16s)]
*  things we're looking for. So how much is going out the door on DEI programs and hires and so on? [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3387.64s)]
*  So there was a DEI office that was immediately shut down. And that alone was a savings of around [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3393.0s)]
*  $20 million. But the thing that we just announced today, in fact, was the closure of this office of [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3398.84s)]
*  human capital, completely different part of the organization. And one that sounds like, okay, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3405.96s)]
*  well, maybe this is like talent management. You're trying to go out and see, well, where's the best [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3412.36s)]
*  talent and where are the gaps we need to fill, which is what I thought. But it turns out that [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3415.7200000000003s)]
*  it was an office where the previous administration kind of hid a bunch of their DEI people, [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3421.8s)]
*  knowing that this action was going to be taken by President Trump. And there was a slush fund there [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3427.64s)]
*  that they would use to fund people millions of dollars to go to DEI conferences and talk to other [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3434.2s)]
*  DEI people. And so we shut that down at a savings of $150 million today. But the thing that I think [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3440.12s)]
*  a lot of people would be surprised by when people talk about DEI and you hear, you know, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3448.28s)]
*  whether CNN, MSNBC, they talk about DEI and they criticize the president for his action [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3452.6000000000004s)]
*  and the actions that we are all taking to get rid of this claiming that we're against diversity [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3457.5600000000004s)]
*  and all of this other crap. When I came in here, I was able to talk with some of the people who work [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3461.5600000000004s)]
*  here. DEI was such a priority that it was baked into the incentive structure for people to advance [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3467.2400000000002s)]
*  professionally here. And I would imagine it was very similar across the federal government, [[00:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3475.96s)]
*  where some employees told me that they were put in a position where they had to spend half of their [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3480.68s)]
*  time working on DEI initiatives in order for them to be able to put it on their annual evaluation [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3485.8s)]
*  and therefore be noted as, oh, you are more likely to get promoted if you are spending [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3493.7200000000003s)]
*  this significant amount of time on this diversity, equity, inclusion initiatives. And for me, [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3499.16s)]
*  I'm like, how in the world would you spend half of your time on that? What were you creating? [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3504.52s)]
*  And I don't really know the answer to that, but I do know the answer to our national security [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3509.48s)]
*  on that question. Because what that means is in the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3514.6s)]
*  and we have people here who work from all across of these 18 intelligence elements being put in [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3520.36s)]
*  a position where they're told if you want to get promoted, if you want to advance in your career, [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3526.44s)]
*  the priority is not are you delivering the best quality intelligence assessments and analysis [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3532.36s)]
*  to best inform the president's most critical decisions? No, you will advance professionally [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3538.04s)]
*  if you show that you're dedicating half of your day towards these DEI initiatives. [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3544.52s)]
*  Your implicit bias. Exactly, exactly. And so when we look at why this was a priority for the president, [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3549.32s)]
*  this is not some superficial thing. There are national security implications to what the [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3555.08s)]
*  Biden administration was doing in centering almost their entire administration around DEI [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3560.44s)]
*  initiatives. You can take this towards any domestic agency. Look at the Department of Education. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3565.8s)]
*  Shouldn't they be focused on educating our kids? Well, wasn't there a group, which intel agency [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3570.52s)]
*  was it that had the people talking about transgender surgeries and non-binary this and... [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3575.2400000000002s)]
*  This is the National Security Agency. Yeah, there's sex groups, polyamory. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3581.64s)]
*  I mean, on and on. This is a great example. So there was someone who snuck into that chat [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3586.04s)]
*  that was not an employee there, and they screenshotted what they saw and leaked it out [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3595.24s)]
*  on X. And again, this is a chat group that was created and administered by the NSA, one of the [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3602.04s)]
*  premier intelligence collection entities that we have. And it was obscene. It was obscene. Yes, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3608.6s)]
*  it was about all of those things. It was talking about sex toys and sex tricks for people who had [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3616.7599999999998s)]
*  gone through some kind of transgender surgery or... During the workday. This is during the workday [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3623.08s)]
*  on an intelligence hosted work chat group. And the supervisors, obviously, as soon as I found out [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3630.76s)]
*  about it, I said, anybody who's involved with this is getting fired and getting their security [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3640.6000000000004s)]
*  clearance revoked, which there were some of you like, oh, gosh, aren't you like that seems extreme. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3644.44s)]
*  Like, no, imagine you're in any office, and you're having these kinds of sexually explicit [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3649.88s)]
*  conversations in the workplace. It is how I don't care what your sexual orientation or whatever [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3655.24s)]
*  your private choices are, this cannot be happening in the workplace. And it must not be happening in [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3660.7599999999998s)]
*  our premier intelligence agency that has people who have the highest clearances that anyone can [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3666.6s)]
*  hold. The plot thickens as many of the leaders feigned shock and surprise at this revelation. [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3674.4399999999996s)]
*  Well, this chat group had existed for over two years that this kind of stuff was happening in. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3682.12s)]
*  And again, this is where transparency and accountability matter so much. As soon as I [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3688.04s)]
*  made that announcement that we will be investigating and holding these people accountable, I started [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3692.44s)]
*  hearing from people who are within the workforce saying, I work at the NSA. I filed a written [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3697.4s)]
*  report with evidence of what was going on in these chat groups a year ago, two years ago, [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3702.84s)]
*  when this thing first kicked up. And basically, because of President Biden's DEI initiatives, [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3708.04s)]
*  they were essentially told, shut up, it's none of your business. And then there was the coverup. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3713.88s)]
*  And then there was the leak. So this is one example of many how we can see what the ramifications [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3719.96s)]
*  have been when we have in the last administration, one that is seemingly focused on everything, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3727.48s)]
*  but the most important things. Speaking of the last administration, one question for you on [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3735.56s)]
*  Signalgate, as I heard you say this recently, is this the first administration to use Signal [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3740.44s)]
*  for confidential chats? Absolutely not. I mean, you actually saw something that told you this was, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3746.84s)]
*  in fact, being used by the Biden administration, who are out there all over X and other social media, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3753.4s)]
*  ripping everyone who was on that Signalgate thread to shreds. That is correct. So there's no question [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3758.7599999999998s)]
*  in your mind this was used during the Biden administration by officials. I know for certain [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3765.0s)]
*  that it was to include national security officials. Is there another way to communicate? Like, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3768.6s)]
*  do we always talk with Signal? So the main means of communication for all of us, like this in this [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3774.76s)]
*  building, this entire building is a secure facility. That means that if you go outside of this lobby, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3780.04s)]
*  there's a bunch of lock boxes over there where you got to lock your phone in, you got to lock your [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3787.56s)]
*  Apple watch or your Aura ring, anything that transmits a Signal gets locked up by everyone [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3792.2799999999997s)]
*  who works here and everyone who visits here before you leave this lobby. How are you supposed to count [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3801.0s)]
*  your steps? Good luck. Take the stairs. The old-fashioned way. Exactly. So the vast majority [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3805.24s)]
*  of the communication that happens is through secure telephones and secure computers and things [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3813.64s)]
*  that are built in to our work environments. However, I do have to leave the building at times [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3818.44s)]
*  and things have to keep moving and rolling. Same goes for those who work in the White House and [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3825.48s)]
*  those who work across the administration. So at times for practical purposes, you have to be able [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3830.6s)]
*  to communicate on the go. Signal has been recognized by the federal government during the Biden [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3835.2400000000002s)]
*  administration, by the way, in December of 2024 as the preferred messaging app because it provides [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3841.64s)]
*  that end-to-end encryption that makes it, nothing is completely secure, but it is the most secure [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3851.7999999999997s)]
*  option if you need to use it. You feel like it was unfair to Pete and Mike Wells? I mean, they [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3858.2799999999997s)]
*  took the brunt of it. Yeah, I mean, it shouldn't have happened. There are sensitive conversations [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3863.0s)]
*  that occur in these Signal chats, but ultimately it was not at all what those who are opposing the [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3868.52s)]
*  president's policies and those in the media made it out to be. And I can tell you that there are [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3877.96s)]
*  some of the most vocal critics of that whole situation who also use Signal and communicate [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3882.92s)]
*  things that they would not want released publicly as well. Not surprised. Exactly. As I've listened [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3890.36s)]
*  to you over this hour, I've had one thought recur to me over and over and over, and it is [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3895.8s)]
*  first female president. That is what I, like, I look at you and I see it. And I know they put you [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3901.32s)]
*  through the meat grinder the last time, but that was the other side. Now you've crossed over. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3907.88s)]
*  And so I just wonder. Thank you for not saying transition. People use that word. It's like, [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3914.92s)]
*  OK, that's one of those words that's like for a certain thing. But [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3920.04s)]
*  notwithstanding how rough that was when you ran for president the first time, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3926.92s)]
*  have you ruled out ever doing it again? Could we potentially see a Tulsi 2028 try? [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3932.52s)]
*  I will never rule out any opportunity to serve my country. I would not have if we had talked [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3940.92s)]
*  a year ago, the thought would not have crossed my mind that I would be here and that we would be [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3948.7599999999998s)]
*  having this conversation. My decisions in my life have always been made around how can I best be of [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3955.3199999999997s)]
*  service to God? How can I best be of service to our country? And that is what has led me here. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3962.44s)]
*  I'm grateful for this opportunity, and I will continue to chase those opportunities where I [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3970.3599999999997s)]
*  can make the most positive impact and be of service. And now you and I sit here having done [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3975.4s)]
*  something the two of us back in 2016 never would have thought we would have done, which was stood [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3982.36s)]
*  up on a stage and endorsed Donald Trump. Now you're working for him. I endorsed him too. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3987.7200000000003s)]
*  It was so great. I was there. I remember it was such a powerful moment and speech that you [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=3993.4s)]
*  delivered because of your history with him. You are very generous to even mention that. What you [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4001.72s)]
*  did for President Trump was huge. And seeing you up there and announcing your partisan change, [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4006.9199999999996s)]
*  with Trump, that was like the team of rivals or the Marvel universe coming together. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4013.3199999999997s)]
*  The Avengers. [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4019.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah, the Avengers. You're one of them. You're one of the most, and the grace, Greek is part of it, [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4020.04s)]
*  and that just works. But I wonder if you do decide to do something in the future, [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4024.4399999999996s)]
*  running for president or individual executive leadership, what have you learned from him? [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4029.8s)]
*  What would you want to take away from the kind of leader Trump is? [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4036.28s)]
*  He's a very bold leader, and as we see, he's making decisions [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4040.6000000000004s)]
*  without care for what the media chirps about him or what his so-called critics may say about him. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4048.1200000000003s)]
*  And he's quite masterful at it, by the way. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4057.32s)]
*  He's been so effective at connecting with the American people in ways that I think a lot of [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4064.6800000000003s)]
*  the politicians or the so-called political pundits here in Washington, D.C., [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4073.08s)]
*  never really understood, and maybe a lot of them still don't. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4080.04s)]
*  But it really comes from a place of care, his care for the American people. He doesn't need to do this. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4082.92s)]
*  He didn't need to put himself through all this. He didn't need to put himself in a position [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4089.72s)]
*  where there were two assassination attempts on his life. And the kind of bold change that we're [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4093.3199999999997s)]
*  seeing happening now across the government, it's never happened like this under any other president. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4100.04s)]
*  So I really respect his boldness and his courage in doing things that sometimes people don't [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4108.6s)]
*  understand or see how it's going to turn out. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4115.160000000001s)]
*  Those are things we see in you, too. Boldness, courage, and you share something else with him, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4121.08s)]
*  which is fearlessly independent. That's what's going to take you forward. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4125.160000000001s)]
*  Thank you so much. It's wonderful to see you. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4130.52s)]
*  It's so good to see you. Thank you very much. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4132.280000000001s)]
*  Good luck with everything. Thank you. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4133.0s)]
*  Gosh. I mean, all of you are going to get in this [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4134.4400000000005s)]
*  environment. Yeah, my money's on you. I appreciate that. Thank you, Megan. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4137.64s)]
*  Lots of love. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6tFyUP0TgrM&t=4140.92s)]
