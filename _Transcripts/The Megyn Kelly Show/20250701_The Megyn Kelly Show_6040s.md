# Kohberger Shocking Plea Deal, Diddy Red Flags, & Trump v Elon Again, w/ Aidala, Murphy, Lowry, Cooke
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [July 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=0.0s)]
*  Wow, there's a lot happening right now. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3.0s)]
*  A new feud has just broken out between President Trump and Elon Musk over the so-called Big Beautiful Bill. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5.0s)]
*  This time Trump considering deporting Elon. Okay, that's not going to happen. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=11.0s)]
*  But obviously they're feuding again. Elon really hates the Big Beautiful Bill. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=15.0s)]
*  But guess what? It looks like at this hour, noon East, on Tuesday afternoon, it looks done. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=19.0s)]
*  Scary to say it, it looks like he's got it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=26.0s)]
*  John Thune is telling, well, Chad Pergram of Fox News, who is always right, is reporting that John Thune has the votes. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=29.0s)]
*  You recall Rand Paul's not going to vote for it. Tom Tillis is not going to vote for it. And he's going to retire. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=38.0s)]
*  And that means the Republicans can lose one more and still get this through because that would bring them, if they lost three, down to 50. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=44.0s)]
*  If they lost 50, JD Vance would cast the tying vote for 51, which is all you need on what's called reconciliation, which is what they use to get through budget bills. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=52.0s)]
*  It's much more than a budget bill. It's Trump's entire agenda. It either goes through or doesn't go through. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=61.0s)]
*  And so they could afford to lose only one more Republican senator. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=67.0s)]
*  They were looking at, of course, Collins and Murkowski, Maine and Alaska. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=72.0s)]
*  They spent all night last night trying to persuade Murkowski to come over as a yes, giving her special little grants for Alaska. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=75.0s)]
*  But then the Senate parliamentarian struck them down saying that you can't stuff this stuff in here. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=83.0s)]
*  It's not straight. It's not it's not part of a budget bill. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=89.0s)]
*  And I can't approve it as part of this bill if it's not part of a budget. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=93.0s)]
*  And so she keeps doing that to them. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=97.0s)]
*  And then Murkowski was seemed to be out and they've spent the morning trying to get her back in. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=99.0s)]
*  And it looks like they have her back in. Look, the guys from National Review are going to be here in a minute and we're going to get to all of that. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=105.0s)]
*  This is very, very big deal. If this gets through today and we'll we'll go there. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=110.0s)]
*  But as we wait for actual news from Capitol Hill, we're going to start with legal news. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=114.0s)]
*  All right. We are watching first all the developments in the trial of Sean Diddy Combs. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=121.0s)]
*  The jury is deliberating right now. They have been for the past three hours today. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=126.0s)]
*  They sent a fifth note to the judge. They started deliberating yesterday at eleven thirty and they left at five. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=131.0s)]
*  Plus, they had lunch. They hadn't really been in there that often or that meant that long. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=138.0s)]
*  And they've already sent five notes to the judge. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=142.0s)]
*  We're going to break down what it's what it may signal from this jury. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=144.0s)]
*  But we begin today with a stunning development in the criminal quadruple murder case against Brian Coburger, the man accused of killing four college students in Idaho. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=148.0s)]
*  Late yesterday evening, prosecutors sent a letter to the family members of the victims telling them Coburger has accepted a plea deal. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=161.0s)]
*  According to at least some of the families, they feel blindsided by this deal. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=170.0s)]
*  Coburger's murder trial was set to begin in August, but now it has all come to an abrupt, unexpected end. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=176.0s)]
*  And I don't blame these families for feeling shocked and disappointed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=184.0s)]
*  They don't they actually don't want this. They wanted the death penalty. They think the case is open and shut. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=191.0s)]
*  They want to see cross examinations and see the case tested and have what happened fully fleshed out in front of a jury in a way that you'll just never get now. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=198.0s)]
*  You'll just never get. They didn't think they needed his plea to get to a guilty verdict. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=209.0s)]
*  And they feel like they were not consulted. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=215.0s)]
*  It is now likely that some of the major questions in this case, like why, why he did this, will never be fully known. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=219.0s)]
*  According to the letter sent to the families, Coburger will be sentenced to four consecutive life sentences on the murder counts, life without the possibility of parole. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=229.0s)]
*  So he will never see the light of day. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=239.0s)]
*  But the family of Kaylee Goncalves, they had been pressing prosecutors to pursue the death penalty. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=241.0s)]
*  They had actually pushed to expand the state's capital punishment rules to allow executions by firing squad. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=247.0s)]
*  That is the kind of justice they wanted. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=253.0s)]
*  From the very beginning, this was a case that captured the nation's attention in its brutality, its unique. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=256.0s)]
*  What's the word indifference to human life? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=267.0s)]
*  And this show has been following it from those early days. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=272.0s)]
*  It is hard to describe just how heinous this crime was. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=276.0s)]
*  But journalist Howard Bloom, who writes for Air Mail, has tried. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=280.0s)]
*  These are passages from an article he wrote in January 2023, just a few months after the murders that took place in the early morning hours of November 13th, 2022. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=285.0s)]
*  In the college town of Moscow, Idaho, Bloom writing, quote, In the heavy quiet of the new Sunday morning, four young corpses, all students, all friends were found hacked to death in their beds in a pale clappered house. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=295.0s)]
*  Little more than a stone's throw away from the heart of the university campus. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=311.0s)]
*  There was so much blood, it has seeped through the wooden floors and run down the building's gray concrete foundation in jagged red rivulets. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=315.0s)]
*  And when police arrived, Bloom continued, a cluster of young people, university students, presumably were milling outside the open front door. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=326.0s)]
*  And yet they were exceptionally quiet. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=335.0s)]
*  They were not merely subdued. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=338.0s)]
*  They seemed stunned as if drained by a deep and intense shock when the three mystified officers approached the front door, someone in the crowd, it would later be shared, muttered a single plaintiff word dead. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=340.0s)]
*  And Bloom wrote about this, about the officers who were first to arrive on the scene, quote, Sergeant Shane Gunderson would confess to others he was unprepared for the strong smell of blood that rose up in his nostrils the moment he walked inside. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=354.0s)]
*  The coroner, who had once been an emergency room nurse in an earlier stage of her life, would describe the scene and press interviews as chaos, lots of blood. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=369.0s)]
*  Few others would even attempt to put into words what they saw. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=379.0s)]
*  There are moments cops will tell you that are too profound, too unnerving to be experienced in the present. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=383.0s)]
*  The victims that night were Madison Mogan, Kaylee Goncalves, both 21 years old. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=391.0s)]
*  They were inseparable best friends since the sixth grade. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=398.0s)]
*  They died together in the same bed. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=402.0s)]
*  Also, Zana Kernodle and Ethan Chapin, both 20 years old. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=405.0s)]
*  They were girlfriend and boyfriend. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=410.0s)]
*  According to a recent Dateline special, Ethan Chapin appeared to be the last of the four to be murdered. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=413.0s)]
*  Sources close to the investigation telling NBC he was believed to be asleep in bed before his death and that Kohlberger carved his lower legs with a blade. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=418.0s)]
*  Two roommates survived that night. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=430.0s)]
*  The house had six roommates in all, six sleeping there. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=432.0s)]
*  And they were expected to testify at trial. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=437.0s)]
*  You remember they did not call the police until the next morning around noon, or they called friends who called the police, even though this had happened at 4 a.m. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=440.0s)]
*  And there has been a lot of speculation about what they would testify to, whether they would be helpful or whether they are just so far gone as a result of this whole thing that they wouldn't be of much use. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=448.0s)]
*  There is no word yet on how they feel about this plea deal, but you can surmise. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=459.0s)]
*  I'm just going to guess they're both very relieved. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=463.0s)]
*  According to that Dateline special, which was so explosive, it caused the defense to move for the trial to be delayed, saying they just took too much of the prosecution's case has been aired and shared against the gag order. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=466.0s)]
*  And it's stunning. And it's all terrible for Kohlberger. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=480.0s)]
*  By the way, the judge did not grant that. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=483.0s)]
*  But the Dateline special had a lot. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=485.0s)]
*  And according to it, Brian Kohlberger in November 2022, this is right around the time of the murder, had searched the Internet for information about infamous serial killer Ted Bundy and made a number of searches for pornography with the keywords drugged, sleeping and passed out. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=487.0s)]
*  And then after the murders, he took this creepy selfie. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=505.0s)]
*  Look at this for the listening audience is him wearing a black hoodie sweatshirt. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=510.0s)]
*  It's like identical to an infamous shot of Ted Bundy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=516.0s)]
*  He he looks so creepy and it it's it comes on the heels of another one. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=521.0s)]
*  He took that morning. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=526.0s)]
*  The morning after the murders, where he was in a white button down shirt in front of a shower, looking as pasty and pale as a human being can be while still alive. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=528.0s)]
*  And this bizarre smile into the camera, which seems to with a thumbs up almost to be telegraphing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=540.0s)]
*  I did it. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=548.0s)]
*  He looks almost proud of himself. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=550.0s)]
*  And now he says to us all, I did it. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=555.0s)]
*  I did it. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=559.0s)]
*  When first arrested, when dragged into court, he refused to say the words, not guilty. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=561.0s)]
*  He refused to speak, which will have the judge enter a plea for you. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=566.0s)]
*  And the judge said, OK, so it's not guilty. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=571.0s)]
*  And a cent was indicated. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=573.0s)]
*  And that's what plea was entered. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=575.0s)]
*  So he has been denying that he did it all along, as you know. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=577.0s)]
*  And now today we learn he's prepared to walk into court tomorrow, Wednesday, which has also shocked the families because they don't all live right in this area. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=580.0s)]
*  They need time to get there, to get plane tickets, to show up. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=591.0s)]
*  We'll see if that gets extended and say, I did it. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=594.0s)]
*  I committed quadruple murder. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=598.0s)]
*  The plea deal requires him to waive his right to appeal. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=601.0s)]
*  There is a hearing again right now scheduled for tomorrow. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=604.0s)]
*  But Kaylee Gonsalves, his father, who I believe is the only one to speak out so far, Steve, is hoping the judge will not sanction the deal. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=607.0s)]
*  He's guilty. We all know he's guilty. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=617.0s)]
*  There's more than enough evidence. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=619.0s)]
*  But it's tough. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=621.0s)]
*  It's tough to put a community through this. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=624.0s)]
*  And it could be bad for reputations and business identities. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=626.0s)]
*  And there's fallout. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=632.0s)]
*  But this isn't the will of the victims. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=635.0s)]
*  I ask the audience, if anybody knows, Judge Hippler, reach out to him and ask him to put his foot down and not accept this offer. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=640.0s)]
*  It doesn't reflect anything in Idaho. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=650.0s)]
*  This is not justice. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=654.0s)]
*  We had an outsider come to our community, kill our kids in their sleep while they're getting a college education, doing everything that they should do. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=655.0s)]
*  And we don't have the courage to hold him accountable. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=663.0s)]
*  No plea deal. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=666.0s)]
*  Let's go for this guy. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=668.0s)]
*  100 percent. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=669.0s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=670.0s)]
*  On NewsNation with Ashley Banfield last night. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=673.0s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss it, Arthur Idallah and Matt Murphy. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=677.0s)]
*  Arthur's a managing partner at Idallah, Bertuna and Kamens and hosted the Arthur Idallah Power Hour on AM 7, 970 in New York. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=680.0s)]
*  Matt, former homicide prosecutor and author of the book, The Book of Murder. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=687.0s)]
*  Matt has prosecuted several high profile serial killers, including the case of Rodney L. Kella, who was known as the dating game killer. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=691.0s)]
*  We've talked to Matt about that case before. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=699.0s)]
*  It wasn't supposed to get this bad. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=708.0s)]
*  You know, remember the time when you actually were on top of your bills? [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=710.0s)]
*  Then inflation hit. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=713.0s)]
*  Groceries, gas, everything shot up. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=714.0s)]
*  Prices up 26 percent from just a few years ago. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=716.0s)]
*  It's not necessarily your fault if you have fallen into real debt. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=719.0s)]
*  Let me share a smarter, faster, far easier way out of it. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=723.0s)]
*  It's called done with debt, and they are not like other debt relief companies. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=726.0s)]
*  They don't push loans or bankruptcy on you. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=730.0s)]
*  Done with debt has legendary negotiators who go head to head with your credit card and loan companies. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=732.0s)]
*  And they have one goal to drastically reduce or eliminate your debt altogether. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=737.0s)]
*  They move lightning fast. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=742.0s)]
*  Most clients see more money in their pocket month one. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=744.0s)]
*  But a word to the wise, hurry, because some of their debt erasing strategies are time sensitive. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=746.0s)]
*  So consider talking to a done with debt strategist before you make another bill payment. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=751.0s)]
*  It's free. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=755.0s)]
*  Visit done with debt dot com, done with debt dot com, done with debt dot com. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=756.0s)]
*  Guys, welcome back to the show. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=761.0s)]
*  This is this is grave. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=763.0s)]
*  I mean, it's pretty shocking, Matt. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=765.0s)]
*  I mean, you spent your whole career as a prosecutor putting away guys like Brian Kohlberger. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=767.0s)]
*  What do you make of Steve Goncalves's strong statements against this saying we weren't told. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=771.0s)]
*  We found out on Friday that they might be talking to him about a plea. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=778.0s)]
*  The next thing we got was a letter on Sunday with an email attachment saying it was it was done. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=782.0s)]
*  We didn't have meaningful input and we don't want this. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=789.0s)]
*  Well, it's very sad. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=794.0s)]
*  First of all, it is a this should never happen. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=797.0s)]
*  Frankly, Megan, you should never have such a disconnect with the family. [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=803.0s)]
*  Whether or not you do a plea or not is a separate issue than the family being informed and being afforded an opportunity to come to court and express their views. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=806.0s)]
*  This is squarely and was known as Marcy's Law or the Crime Victims Bill of Rights. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=816.0s)]
*  And what you see in California, this is actually enshrined in the Constitution where victims have a right to be heard and they have a right to be present for all significant proceedings. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=821.0s)]
*  So, well, the the reasons they give are are good. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=831.0s)]
*  I mean, they're they're well articulated. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=837.0s)]
*  They explain the appellate process and how that goes on for years. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=839.0s)]
*  But the disconnect with the family is is it is a tragic element to this. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=843.0s)]
*  Now, what's interesting is only the dissolvers family is talking, which makes me think maybe the other families were on board. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=849.0s)]
*  But it seems like such a short period of time, the turnaround is I'm really kind of surprised by that, that they apparently heard from the defense very recently, like within the last couple of days. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=855.0s)]
*  And then they turn this thing around and the plea is supposed to get out tomorrow. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=867.0s)]
*  Well, they can solve his family saying that they can't even get up there in time. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=871.0s)]
*  So they're asking for the court to delay it, which could actually delay it. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=874.0s)]
*  But I expect that this plea will go through. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=878.0s)]
*  Right, because they don't want to do anything that's going to jeopardize the words. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=881.0s)]
*  I did it coming out of this guy's mouth. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=884.0s)]
*  Arthur, you used to be a prosecutor. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=886.0s)]
*  You've spent more recent years as a defense attorney. [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=888.0s)]
*  Is this guy is Brian Kohlberger when pleading guilty going to have to allocate in a way that would tell us everything? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=891.0s)]
*  That would answer any of our questions. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=900.0s)]
*  Or are we more likely to get a guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty goodbye? [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=902.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was Megan. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=909.0s)]
*  I was just involved in a case where I was representing the victims families and he actually went to trial. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=911.0s)]
*  And even at the trial, they could see on videotape, they could see him doing it, but there's zero motive, zero motive. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=918.0s)]
*  And the family asked me and I did go to the prosecutor and to the defense attorney and say, look, if you tell us why this happened, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=926.0s)]
*  we'll as the victim family asked for less time than 25 to life, which is the maximum here in New York. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=935.0s)]
*  And the guy refused to do so. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=941.0s)]
*  And this family is the anniversary whose death was yesterday. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=942.0s)]
*  This family is guys in jail, 25 to life. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=946.0s)]
*  They have no idea why he was executed. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=950.0s)]
*  And that may be the hardest thing for the family members. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=952.0s)]
*  It's the same thing here. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=956.0s)]
*  It's obvious that this guy did it, but they want to know why. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=957.0s)]
*  I will say, though, that family members who have to sit through this and both of you know, there are often autopsy pictures that are shown and you hear the description and how people died. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=962.0s)]
*  And that's, you know, when you're a family member, you're sitting there, you're hearing about your 21 year old gorgeous daughter and how she met her death. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=974.0s)]
*  It's horrible. It's absolutely horrible. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=981.0s)]
*  So he's not going to have to go through it bit by bit, Matt. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=985.0s)]
*  No, no, he'll just he'll just do it. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=989.0s)]
*  He'll just do the on this date at this time. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=991.0s)]
*  We got this location. Yes. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=993.0s)]
*  And did you cause the death by this person? Yes. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=995.0s)]
*  And did you cause the death by using a knife? Yes, I did. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=997.0s)]
*  And did you intend to cause the death at that time? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1000.0s)]
*  Yes. That's it. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1003.0s)]
*  But let me ask you this, because, Matt, you've dealt with these serial killers before. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1005.0s)]
*  And I mean, I think that's that's fairly it's fair to say that was the road this guy was on. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1008.0s)]
*  I mean, he committed four in one night and was obsessed with. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1013.0s)]
*  I absolutely think so. Yeah. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1016.0s)]
*  I mean, this is this is all hallmarks. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1018.0s)]
*  He's sorry. Sorry, Megan. I don't want to step. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1020.0s)]
*  I was just going to say that these guys, these serial killers, they do like to talk. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1022.0s)]
*  I mean, historically, they want to be celebrated. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1025.0s)]
*  I'm sure this is another problem the family will have, whatever attention he's likely to get for the rest of his life. [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1030.0s)]
*  But on the upside, he might he might actually explain why he did what he did at some point. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1035.0s)]
*  Well, there's a narcissism to these guys that is off the charts. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1041.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, this is truly that that's the psychopathic personality. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1045.0s)]
*  It's almost a spectrum where we all like narcissism or the narcissist is a is a buzzword these days on social media. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1049.0s)]
*  And the psychopath is the extreme version of that. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1056.0s)]
*  The problem is art is exactly right here. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1059.0s)]
*  It's called a factual basis when you do a plea. [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1062.0s)]
*  You know, it's literally on this time with I'm off on 10. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1066.0s)]
*  I entered the home and caused the death of it's very, very sterilized. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1070.0s)]
*  And part of the power of these guys that you so often see is he's going to get off, I think, on the pain that he's caused those families. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1074.0s)]
*  I see that over and over again with serial killers like this. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1083.0s)]
*  And I think that if I had to if I had a bet, Megan, I would bet he never says a word because he knows that it's still inflicting some degree of suffering to these families of these poor kids. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1086.0s)]
*  Them not knowing. And again, art is absolutely right. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1099.0s)]
*  A lot of times the families, they just want to know the answer why. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1102.0s)]
*  But in a case like this, I don't think any answer the Coburger would could even give would be satisfactory to anybody. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1105.0s)]
*  He did it probably because he he wanted to do it. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1112.0s)]
*  And and it's one of the great questions in criminal law. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1115.0s)]
*  Like, what makes these guys tick? [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1118.0s)]
*  What makes serial killers want to slaughter innocent people? [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1120.0s)]
*  You know, and I'm with art. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1123.0s)]
*  I also do some some victim representation in California. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1125.0s)]
*  It's called Marcy's Law. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1129.0s)]
*  And I've shared that experience with him. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1130.0s)]
*  Like, art's exactly right. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1132.0s)]
*  Families want that answer. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1134.0s)]
*  But with a guy like Coburger, they're probably just never going to get it outside of a trial, which I don't think we're going to see. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1135.0s)]
*  But you know, it's interesting. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1141.0s)]
*  Regarding the narcissistic part of it, he really won't be a household name the way like Casey Anthony is. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1143.0s)]
*  And because he's correct me if I'm wrong, Megan, but I believe we were going to cover his trial because it was going to be televised. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1151.0s)]
*  Yes. Right. [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1156.0s)]
*  For like weeks. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1157.0s)]
*  So when those cases get televised, Jodi Arias and and comes to mind, obviously, OJ is the biggest one of all time. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1159.0s)]
*  You know, he would have been much more of a known guy than kind of going off quietly with a quickly and it will be over. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1168.0s)]
*  So it it does fly in the face of it. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1177.0s)]
*  Like if he really wanted if this is what he wanted to do, it would become this famous dude going through the trial is is is a great, a sick thing to say. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1181.0s)]
*  But it's a really good way to get your name out there. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1190.0s)]
*  And that now has gone by the way. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1193.0s)]
*  There's something interesting on this front. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1195.0s)]
*  I'll tell you, Howard Bloom, who's been doing great work reporting on this from the beginning, sent me a note this morning saying he's hearing that a large part of the reason Coburger cut this deal was to protect his parents. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1197.0s)]
*  His father would have been called to testify about what was said during that cross country trip they took together. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1208.0s)]
*  You remember after the murders, the dad flew out there on I think it was December 4th. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1214.0s)]
*  The murders were December, November 22nd overnight into the 23rd. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1218.0s)]
*  And the dad traveled cross country from Washington state back home to the Poconos in Pennsylvania with him. [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1222.0s)]
*  And on top of that, we learned this in the Dateline schedule that at six a.m. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1229.0s)]
*  the morning after the murders, Brian Coburger called his mother and spoke with her for nearly an hour. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1235.0s)]
*  This is the first time hearing it was the mother. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1241.0s)]
*  I knew he had called home and spoke with his mom for nearly an hour. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1243.0s)]
*  He did not want his mother to have to testify about that call or his sister about confronting the father with her suspicions that Brian may have done it. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1246.0s)]
*  I don't know, Matt. I mean, does a sociopath, a psychopath like this have feelings for his dad or his mom? [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1256.0s)]
*  Is that possible? [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1262.0s)]
*  You know, we hear the term anthropomorphizing, which is when people start attributing human emotions to animals. [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1264.0s)]
*  And in a way, a guy like this, I think that what he's really worried about, Megan, is he's in Idaho and he could actually be executed for this. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1270.0s)]
*  And I agree with Art. The evidence in this case is overwhelming. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1279.0s)]
*  And especially those little things like those little selfies and things like that. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1283.0s)]
*  He was going down as the defense he knew was going down. [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1286.0s)]
*  And I think fundamentally that the psychopaths, the one human they actually care about is themselves. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1288.0s)]
*  And I think that that's what motivated them. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1296.0s)]
*  I don't think a guy like Coburger actually cares about too many other people. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1298.0s)]
*  And I think that that's a nice speculative sort of human interpretation of that. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1302.0s)]
*  I think that he's worried about it literally in the state of Idaho's own neck more than what his family would go through. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1307.0s)]
*  That's my take on it. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1313.0s)]
*  You know, it's interesting, though, and I was thinking about this this morning, preparing to come here, bomb him. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1314.0s)]
*  I don't like to equate myself to being him, but I would want to do some investigation as what life is like with life in prison. [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1320.0s)]
*  If it is like it is like with the federal guys like the World Trade Center bombers and stuff where you're just in a cage basically 23 hours a day and every third day you get to go out. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1330.0s)]
*  But the rest of the time you're in this still this little cage and maybe you get a radio and you get a book. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1342.0s)]
*  I don't know at his age, would I want to live the next 50 or 60 years like that or would I rather prefer euthanasia? [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1347.0s)]
*  It'll take 10 years before they actually put a needle in his arm or shoot him or whatever they're going to do out there. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1353.0s)]
*  But, you know, living in a cage is for 50 or 60 years. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1358.0s)]
*  That's rough. I mean, I speak to the government. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1365.0s)]
*  No, it's not right. Exactly. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1368.0s)]
*  I mean, I don't know. I would like to figure out I would like to see if I'm him. [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1371.0s)]
*  I want to know what's my life now. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1375.0s)]
*  He may be going to a facility where there's college education. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1377.0s)]
*  There's a barbershop. There's a dentist. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1382.0s)]
*  I mean, prisons are small communities. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1384.0s)]
*  Prisons are small communities. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1386.0s)]
*  Right. You're raising a very good point because what are we debating right now in California? [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1388.0s)]
*  Whether these Menendez brothers should be let out. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1393.0s)]
*  Oh, they were young when this happened. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1396.0s)]
*  They had an abusive dad, you know, like now with the benefit of all this hindsight, shouldn't we let them out of prison? [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1399.0s)]
*  And, you know, that when there's no death penalty, the odds of us getting in 20 years, Matt. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1405.0s)]
*  Oh, you know, he was young. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1411.0s)]
*  He had autism spectrum disorder as if that makes people murder for innocent victims because they're already playing that card on the defense team. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1413.0s)]
*  You know, he had some disorders where he saw visual snow. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1421.0s)]
*  Really, we should there should be some sort of a mercy afforded his way that as long as he's still breathing, that's still out there as a possibility. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1425.0s)]
*  Well, you're absolutely right. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1435.0s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1436.0s)]
*  You and I have talked about the Menendez brothers before, and that's exactly what we saw there. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1437.0s)]
*  They they received life without possibility of parole. [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1441.0s)]
*  And that turned out not to be life without possibility of parole. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1444.0s)]
*  Right. So you're absolutely right, Megan. [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1448.0s)]
*  And online on this, there are a lot of conspiracy theorists that the prosecution even noted in their justification letter that they submitted publicly. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1450.0s)]
*  That was so weird. That was very weird. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1458.0s)]
*  And it really is. [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1461.0s)]
*  That's the nightmare for the family. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1463.0s)]
*  But again, you know, the appellate process and art touched on this, the appellate process in especially going through the Ninth Circuit, which is where my eight death penalty cases are now kind of rumbling through. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1465.0s)]
*  You never really have any finality for the family. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1478.0s)]
*  But there is a cathartic aspect, Megan, that a lot of people don't understand. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1482.0s)]
*  Unless you're in the situation of of of having a loved one that's been murdered, it's very difficult to really understand their need for justice and need for answers. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1486.0s)]
*  And for a lot of family members having the community come in and say, we understand that there's a long appellate process, but your loved one was so valuable. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1497.0s)]
*  And you, Mr. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1505.0s)]
*  Defendant, are so terrible that you deserve to die for what you did, whether you're ever executed or not being a separate question. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1507.0s)]
*  That can be really good for families. [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1513.0s)]
*  And it sounds like the Gonzales family really wanted that. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1516.0s)]
*  Maybe some of the other family members didn't or other families didn't. [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1519.0s)]
*  And that's something that you deal with from time to time on death penalty cases. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1523.0s)]
*  You'll have a family member that's adamantly opposed to the death penalty for whatever reason. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1526.0s)]
*  But ultimately, it's the prosecution's call. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1530.0s)]
*  But it should never come as a surprise to the family. [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1533.0s)]
*  This should be in the loop. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1535.0s)]
*  And I don't know what happened. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1537.0s)]
*  They've been the unofficial spokesman for the for the families in a way, because we've heard from Stephen Salvas more than anybody and also his wife, Maddie Mogens. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1538.0s)]
*  Parents have not spoken as much. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1547.0s)]
*  Ethan Chapin's parents have spoken and seemed this is just my impression. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1549.0s)]
*  Like they seem like they're in a kinder, gentler place, not with respect to the defendant, but just they're more focused on their son and who he was and trying to keep who Ethan was in our minds. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1554.0s)]
*  And Steve Gonzales, totally understandably, I think I'd be more like him, is, you know, he means business. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1565.0s)]
*  He wants a conviction of this guy on a death penalty case. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1572.0s)]
*  And Xana Cronodle, I haven't heard anything really much from her parents, so I don't know that we will hear much. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1576.0s)]
*  And then there's the other two witnesses who I know. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1582.0s)]
*  I mean, the one witness seems to have been kind of a mess. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1584.0s)]
*  You know, the one Dylan Mortenson, who was there and made eye contact with him and then later kind of was like, I don't know what I saw and didn't call the cops. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1588.0s)]
*  And they've been, you know, the subject of a lot of speculation that's been not flattering because people can't understand what took you eight hours. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1597.0s)]
*  You were on the Internet. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1604.0s)]
*  You were on social media like any of us can really ever understand what these girls went through. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1605.0s)]
*  Anyway, the point is, I'm sure there's mixed, mixed amongst the families and the prosecution thought, you know, a bird in the hand. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1610.0s)]
*  I do want to mention the conspiracy thing that Matt just mentioned. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1617.0s)]
*  The prosecutors cited concerns about conspiracy theorists and supporters of the defendant in their explanatory offerings as to why they did this. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1621.0s)]
*  That there are sadly, as many have experienced, there are individuals out there who believe in conspiracy theories about this case, believe the defendant to be innocent or support the defendant in some way. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1632.0s)]
*  And this is something the prosecutors are there factored in to why they wanted to settle the case. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1645.0s)]
*  Look, Megan, you know, it's still fresh in my blood. [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1654.0s)]
*  I mean, it would work to our advantage. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1657.0s)]
*  But in the Weinstein trial just now, you know, one of the jurors just said, look, I'm not deliberating. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1659.0s)]
*  I'm being intimidated by other jurors and I quit. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1664.0s)]
*  And that for that one count, now they had reached verdict on other counts. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1667.0s)]
*  That one count went out the window. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1671.0s)]
*  You just talked about there's been five notes in the P. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1673.0s)]
*  Diddy trial. Who knows what's going to go on there? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1676.0s)]
*  And you and I could, Matt, we could rattle off examples of trials that you think are going to go in the right way. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1678.0s)]
*  And then they go in a different direction or they blow up. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1683.0s)]
*  The prosecutors in the Luigi case here in New York are probably wondering that. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1686.0s)]
*  I mean, this guy got more birthday presents and money. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1692.0s)]
*  And I mean, he executed a man in cold blood in the back and people are supporting him. [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1695.0s)]
*  So as a prosecutor, look, more life sentences. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1700.0s)]
*  And I understand what you're both saying about it can still be overturned in 30 or 40 years. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1704.0s)]
*  But when you have a guarantee, you are able to and the communication should have been a hundred times better than allegedly it was between prosecutors and the victims families. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1709.0s)]
*  But you have a guarantee that this kid is not getting out, even in the best case scenario for decades and decades. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1720.0s)]
*  Guaranteed, guaranteed decades and decades and decades as a prosecutor. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1725.0s)]
*  I think it's the responsible thing to do to accept that plea. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1730.0s)]
*  And I accept I assume the judge is going to do the same thing. [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1733.0s)]
*  Yeah. Can I weigh in on that just for a second? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1736.0s)]
*  Megan, I hate that they did that, to be honest with you. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1738.0s)]
*  I hate that they that they empowered those those fools that think there's a conspiracy. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1741.0s)]
*  I don't like that at all. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1745.0s)]
*  And I think that I don't disagree with what Archer said at all. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1747.0s)]
*  But you strap this case on. [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1750.0s)]
*  You don't give the some conspiracy theorist online behind their keyboard the power to influence a freaking plea. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1753.0s)]
*  That was a mistake that makes them look terrible. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1758.0s)]
*  I think that, you know, that may be what was actually going on in their head, but that's why you're a frigging prosecutor. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1761.0s)]
*  You put the case on and you disprove those people because the evidence in this was truly overwhelming. [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1766.0s)]
*  And I mean, I really that's what kind of hit me when I read that line. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1772.0s)]
*  That was they shouldn't have included that. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1778.0s)]
*  The family should have been better informed. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1780.0s)]
*  Art's absolutely right. This guarantees it. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1782.0s)]
*  He's also waving appeal as a part of this deal, which is no small thing. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1784.0s)]
*  But I just I didn't like that. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1788.0s)]
*  I and I know it probably struck art the same way. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1791.0s)]
*  This is a small it's a small county. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1794.0s)]
*  They've only done nine, I think, nine death penalty cases. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1796.0s)]
*  There's nine, eight or nine people on death row in all of Idaho, which means it speaks for lack of experience on this type of case. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1799.0s)]
*  And I was really, really I've been rooting for the prosecution this entire time. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1806.0s)]
*  I was very disappointed to read that. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1811.0s)]
*  And I was heartbroken by the consul's convolt consul his statement. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1813.0s)]
*  Solve us. Yeah. [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1817.0s)]
*  But when you're when you're a pro, that's you take the heat, you put it on, you win with evidence, you follow the law and you convince everybody the contrary. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1818.0s)]
*  You know, the thing is, I think what they're afraid of is like having one nut job on the jury. [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1826.0s)]
*  You know, all you need is one. Right. [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1831.0s)]
*  And that sneaks on and you know, that look, it's the federal court. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1832.0s)]
*  There's basically no jury selection. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1836.0s)]
*  So it looks like I mean, the first note in that case, I know, we're going to go there. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1838.0s)]
*  The second was like, there's someone in here who doesn't can't comprehend. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1842.0s)]
*  Well, we'll get to it in a second. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1845.0s)]
*  I know. Let me just say that Brian Enton of News Nation who broke this news, he broke this news yesterday and he's been covering this from the beginning, sent out the following. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1847.0s)]
*  He said, My personal feeling is from the beginning, Idaho has not wanted to deal with this case. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1856.0s)]
*  To your point, Matt, he says from University of Idaho, taking ownership of the house and tearing it down, also over some of the family's objections, including good solvus to the initial judge, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1861.0s)]
*  passing the case on, he bounced it over to this other judge to the gag order, which was very controversial amongst the families. [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1871.0s)]
*  How can they not speak about their loved ones being murdered and constant annoyance with any attention the case gets? [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1877.0s)]
*  And, you know, he seems to be saying that just your point, Matt. Yes, they really didn't want to do this. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1885.0s)]
*  They're not used to doing this. It's not like your big jurisdiction in Los Angeles and Orange County. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1892.0s)]
*  I think it was right. It's a smaller town. They haven't done a lot of this. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1897.0s)]
*  They may have felt uncomfortable. And I don't know, you know, they may be cut from a different cloth altogether. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1901.0s)]
*  You know, it's not like New York where Arthur practices were like, unfortunately, there are a lot of murders and there's a lot of death and destruction. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1907.0s)]
*  And as a New Yorker, it's not like you don't care, but you get a little immune to it. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1914.0s)]
*  It's not exactly that way out in Idaho. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1919.0s)]
*  And I'm sure there was a reluctance if they could get out of this to go forward anyway. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1922.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, like you're if you become a fighter pilot, fly the jet and shoot the missiles, you know, you become a doctor, you become a surgeon, you know, you don't shy away from the big operation. [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1928.0s)]
*  And I agree with everything you just said, Megan. It's true. [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1939.0s)]
*  And but Brian makes some great points. He really does. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1944.0s)]
*  It's it's there have been a lot of things that I interpret it as as in being very careful because they don't want to screw the case up on appeal. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1948.0s)]
*  The Ninth Circuit is historically very, you know, the appellate scrutiny is intense, especially on death penalty cases. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1955.0s)]
*  But, you know, I was very disappointed by this, to be honest with you, in case I haven't made that obvious at this point. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1964.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I would think, Megan, if the Luigi Manjoni defense team went into the prosecutors and he's facing the death penalty here in federal court and said, OK, he'll take life without parole. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1970.0s)]
*  I'm guessing the U.S. attorney is going to be like, OK, I Department of Justice is going to say, OK, I don't think I don't think you take that risk with the 12 jurors and you don't know exactly what they're going to do. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1980.0s)]
*  The one thing I want to point out is that they revealed that the defense went to the prosecution and said, please make us an offer. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=1992.0s)]
*  It was not the prosecution afraid to go forward. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2001.0s)]
*  It was good old Ann Taylor, who's been bluffing a good game and trying to get endless delays of this case so her client could live another day, who finally went in there, waved the white flag as we all knew she had to. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2004.0s)]
*  They have this guy dead to rights. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2019.0s)]
*  They have his DNA on the knife sheath that was used to hold the murder weapon. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2022.0s)]
*  They have him throwing away his garbage in Ziploc baggies that he was depositing in the neighbors trash back in the Poconos so that his DNA couldn't be easily discovered by cops who were already three steps ahead of him. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2027.0s)]
*  They have his car circling the murder house in the moments leading up to the murder, his phone going off just for the time that the murder was committed, then going back on returning to the crime scene the next day. [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2041.0s)]
*  His Internet searches. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2054.0s)]
*  He looked for the K bar knife to replace the one he had clearly lost after committing the murders. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2056.0s)]
*  He ordered overalls of the kind he we now know he had earlier testified would help somebody hide the blood and cover up having committed a crime and they had him dead to rights. [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2061.0s)]
*  He had no shot and Antler did the right thing for him. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2073.0s)]
*  I think personally the only thing that could stop this thing from actually happening tomorrow is Brian Kohlberger himself because Howard Bloom has been reporting that he has been the holdout on taking a guilty plea that there might have been a rift developing. [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2076.0s)]
*  Rift developing between attorney and client on this and there was some rumbling about whether and Taylor the lawyer was thinking of a maneuver to eat like somehow have him declared incompetent or do something to get around his holding out and it looks like eventually she got to him and maybe to how is reporting. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2090.0s)]
*  She at least used the hell that his parents were going to have to go through you know to try to give him a hook out. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2108.0s)]
*  Go ahead Matt. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2116.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's all right. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2118.0s)]
*  Everything you just said is correct. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2121.0s)]
*  But ultimately it's the prosecution's decision. [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2123.0s)]
*  So we never offered to plead our death cases like there was one that we dealt my James Satori ship case and that was the DA's call after new mitigating evidence came forward and the DA decided to give to him. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2126.0s)]
*  But other than that, the defense can't force this so you can come in and ask for a deal. [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2140.0s)]
*  He can certainly has the right to plead guilty and then go into the penalty phase and determine what the appropriate sentences. But this is under this is controlled by the prosecution, and they decided to do it. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2145.0s)]
*  The family wasn't on board. So ultimately it's their call. They don't have to accept that that offer from the defense. You can plead guilty but the death determination or LWOP is something that ultimately it's it's it's the prosecution's call to agree to that or not. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2158.0s)]
*  So this is a deal. I just I just want to make sure though. Do we know that all family members were not on board or no. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2176.0s)]
*  We don't know how the other three feel right. We know it's a good point. It's a very good point. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2183.0s)]
*  I don't mean to step on you but and let me just tell you something though to your point earlier Matt and Megan. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2187.0s)]
*  In the case I just tried the prosecutors flew literally all over the world to talk to witnesses to put somebody in jail. [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2193.0s)]
*  Okay. This is that to me that rises the same level here. If these prosecutors needed to get on the plane this past Saturday to go speak to the deceased family to let them know look you're not making the call. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2200.0s)]
*  This is the elected prosecutor. They're making the call. But we want to let you know why we're doing it and what the reasoning is and what are they deserve. They definitely deserve that. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2212.0s)]
*  And if that did not happen we don't know if it did or didn't. It sounds like it didn't at least with one family member then shame on them because when you're making such a big decision it is their decision. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2222.0s)]
*  But you got to hold hand you got to have bedside manner. You should have a psychiatrist or a social worker or someone. I mean I mean this is such an enormous tragedy. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2232.0s)]
*  You can't just be like is I mean if they found out via email. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2242.0s)]
*  Beyond discussed that is yeah. And on disgusting that you open an email about right. Yeah. That's that little thing is gone and we're just going to give him like bye bye. Come back. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2247.0s)]
*  Yeah. You got 72 hours. I mean I'm hoping that that is not actually what took place and there was a lot more personal interaction between the process. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2256.0s)]
*  Who knows this Steve Gonzalez has been pretty reliable and he's he's revealed a lot that's that's been proven out. I can't imagine he's lying about that. That's poor man. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2266.0s)]
*  He said we were treated as the opposition from the very beginning from the very beginning. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2275.0s)]
*  And this just coming. All it says this is from Brian and again News Nation reporting that Ethan Chapin's family will be in court tomorrow and does support the plea deal. [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2280.0s)]
*  That doesn't surprise me. I said that's the one other family that we've heard from a bit. They're very focused on Ethan and everything I've heard them say has been trying to get us to remember what their son was like. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2291.0s)]
*  He was a triplet and his two other siblings I think go to the same university. Can you imagine. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2301.0s)]
*  OK. Let's move on because we only have about another 10 minutes or so on. I want to get to what's happened in Diddy. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2307.0s)]
*  I think Ben in there. I mean we have almost more questions than we have jurors now or numbers of deliberation of hours. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2312.0s)]
*  Five questions. They're very interesting. What the hell's going on with juror 25. Just to as point of clarification the jurors have their numbers from what dear. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2318.0s)]
*  So it's not they have 25 jurors like they have their numbers. It doesn't mean there's 25 jurors there are eight jurors eight men sorry 12 jurors eight men four women. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2329.0s)]
*  And this guy's one of them. And the note out to the judge yesterday was we have a juror number 25 quoting here who we are concerned cannot cannot follow your honors instructions. [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2336.0s)]
*  After conferring with the lawyers the judge sent back in a note saying do it do it do it anyway. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2349.0s)]
*  Like saying I reviewed your note. I remind every juror of their duty to deliberate and their obligation to follow my instruction in the law with that instruction in mind please continue deliberating. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2356.0s)]
*  And they did. What does that mean. This guy veterinarian 51 Hispanic PhDs and macroeconomics and something else nuclear molecular biology I think has a domestic partner who's male and who is a graphic designer lives in New York goes to the opera watches nature [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2366.0s)]
*  documentaries argue may or may not be climate change they said. And I don't know I don't know what to make of this he doesn't sound like somebody who can't speak English who can't understand things. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2384.0s)]
*  He definitely can follow the instructions. So what do you glean from this matter start with you. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2395.0s)]
*  Well first of all it's the worst nightmare for any prosecutor when you've got a comment from the foreperson right away and note to the judge that somebody is not deliberating my guess. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2401.0s)]
*  Megan just from a whole bunch of trials and a lot of speculation since they didn't give us anything else is it sounds like you went back and announced his verdict. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2413.0s)]
*  If I had to guess you went back and either said I don't want to talk I don't want to deliberate these guys guilty or this guy is I'm not convicted no matter what that that'd be my guess he came in and very strongly announced an opinion at the very beginning which prompted the [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2422.0s)]
*  foreperson to say hey you got to deliberate dude we got to talk about this. That's my guess. And I know I know getting notes like that are night both probably have PTSD for many years of doing it from the defense side. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2435.0s)]
*  That's you love seeing that from the prosecution side you you have a problem right at the outset so hopefully they straight. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2448.0s)]
*  Well in federal court unlike in many state courts in federal where they are as right it is not as big of a problem as it is in the state court because the judge has the power I did all this research yesterday. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2456.0s)]
*  The judge has the power to call that particular juror out not asking about what's going on specifically in the deliberation room but he the judge can make an inquiry and if the judge determined that this juror cannot be a fair and impartial juror for whatever reason that didn't come out in [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2472.0s)]
*  or I'll give you an example he gets deathly ill and can no longer deliberate in federal court the judge has the jurisdiction to rule that a criminal defendant can have a fair and impartial trial and a verdict with just 11 jurors he can dismiss this juror for good cause and have 11 jurors deliberate trust me the judge doesn't want that the prosecutor does not want that because it creates a valid issue but there are appellate cases on point and I'm not going to go into that. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2490.0s)]
*  But there are appellate cases on point that says the judge has tremendously way at the end of a long trial like this where so many resources have been spent if a juror is unavailable or unable to be a fair and impartial juror at that point the judge can dismiss them and 11 jurors can go forward and reach a verdict. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2518.0s)]
*  I think that's an alternate. [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2536.0s)]
*  What do you make of Matt's theory because I had the same reaction as Matt did somebody saying my mind's made up there's no point in deliberating I'm never moving off of insert verdict here. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2538.0s)]
*  Is that what you're I mean we have no idea what we're talking about the audience should know we are all totally speculating but that's the fun of waiting for a jury that's what we do. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2548.0s)]
*  I'll just speak for myself and I'm usually wrong. I mean I just did this and we had I know a dozen notes 15 notes and I you know know where what they're doing but the jurors allowed to go in there and say listen I listened intently to all the evidence. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2556.0s)]
*  I don't need any read backs I focused I listened to every second and I think he's not guilty of all counts and you know I'll sit here you guys can talk all you want but there's nothing you're going to tell me that the witnesses didn't tell me a direct examination or I learned a cross examination that's going to change my mind. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2571.0s)]
*  They're allowed to you know you're allowed to do that as a juror you can't say I'm not going to find him guilty because he's a black man and I think black men have been so demonized in society so that's what my verdict is you can't do that because now you're not finding a verdict based on the evidence which is what the judge's instructions are. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2589.0s)]
*  But if you say I listened to all the evidence and here's my verdict and you know I'm not going to be threatened to beat up or convinced otherwise he's allowed to do that. I was afraid when I heard that note that it was someone who didn't have the intellectual capacity because in federal court as you guys know. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2608.0s)]
*  That's not this guy's problem. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2624.0s)]
*  Right there's not a lot of heavy voir dire in jury selection the lawyers don't get to speak to the jurors in jury selection in federal court so sometimes you don't realize there's a screwball in there based on a questionnaire that they filled out but yes it does not sound like he has the background where he can't and it seems like maybe that ship has sailed. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2625.0s)]
*  I mean it's almost you know it's the next day and they haven't get we're sending back any notes like this guy's a that's right now they're deliberating but now they they sent out a question asking if I don't have the exact wording in front of me but basically asking if a person has drugs and gives them to another person because the other person asked for them is that possession with intent to distribute which is what he's charged with is one of the one of the many predicate acts for the Rico count it's not a separate charge.

*  I mean I think we can all agree the answer that is yes it is that that is your toast the answer is yes so substantively the answer back to the jury is basically good for the prosecution but they didn't answer back to the jury like that Matt they just said that the judge is so annoying I'm sure the jury's feeling it he just said oh you have a question about my instructions please consult my instructions and he did not add any other color to it and then the most interesting note that's that to me at least suggests because if you look at the verdict form I don't know how they're going after this because if you look at the jury instructions they get the verdict form and then they're like oh I'm going to go to the jury and they're like oh I'm going to go to the jury and they're like oh I'm going to go to the jury and they're like oh I'm going to go to the jury and they're like oh I'm going to go to the jury and they're like oh I'm going to go to the jury and they're like [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2673.0s)]
*  they talk about the predicate acts and they may just be going through the jury instructions if you look at the verdict form it starts with Rico guilty or not guilty and only if they if they check guilty do they go on to have to consider each one of the predicate acts including in possession with intent to distribute so if they're just going off the verdict form then that might tell us that they're that they're on a guilty for racketeering but if they're going off the jury instructions then they might just be kicking around all the predicate acts before they get to guilty or not guilty on Rico but anyway I there's there's some [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2703.0s)]
*  cause for hope from both sides and then they get to the really interesting one which was today where they asked about testimony they want testimony sent back into the jury room and it's it's interesting they wanted Cassie hold on I'm trying to find I have so many notes on my phone about the big beautiful bill trying to get back to the relevant texts they wanted Cassie Ventura's testimony I can't find it they wanted and and then Danielle Phillips sex worker who was hired for free crocs right [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2733.0s)]
*  they wanted information about what happened at the hotel intercontinental which is where she was beaten in the middle of a freak off and dragged back in there all of that would seem potentially to be good for the prosecution but again we don't know crapola your thoughts on it guys well I you know having just done a two month trial and these notes the Harvey trial just in case people are wondering now it didn't go Arthur's way but he did a great job at the well it kind of went my way we beat the two top counts we did all right it's up to the sentencing [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2763.0s)]
*  we can go if the judge sentences in the way should be sentenced then we went from twenty three years to a lot better and he can see the light of the end of the day at least in New York anyway I'm what we had a day with after all the notes would come in was who the F. knows who the F. knows I mean I've tried more cases that I can count and I've been so wrong so many times you know we get to talk to jurors sometimes afterwards and when they when you hear from them why they ask certain questions you know like wow I really don't know what I'm [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2793.0s)]
*  doing like they're thinking it's so many they're looking at things in such a different way than we do as lawyers because they're electricians and school teachers and school bus drivers okay but I don't mean to cut you off but I do want to get to like what they're asking about because I think it's it's somewhat telling okay the first one is Cassie Ventura's testimony regarding internet internet or whatever intercontinental her testimony concerning the events at Khan and those that immediately followed via USA Today here was that testimony in part a [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=2823.0s)]

*  levels but just to slow the rate of growth the idea that that is going to be some you know massive [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3457.58s)]
*  cut to the health services that Americans get is crazy not to mention that a lot of the reforms [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3465.02s)]
*  that are being looked at here have to do with people who shouldn't be on Medicaid in the first [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3476.1s)]

*  need Medicaid are the people who do need Medicaid in fact some of the changes that have been [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3488.94s)]
*  proposed here were endorsed by that right-wing fiber either Barack Obama ten years ago so this [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3494.86s)]
*  is demagoguery the second part side of it as you mentioned which is that to pay for the tax cuts [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3500.46s)]
*  for billionaires is also not true the 2017 tax cuts did obviously cut taxes for rich people but [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3506.1s)]
*  rich people pay all the taxes so that seems fair they also cut taxes for everyone else what has [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3511.82s)]
*  changed about this bill compared to the 2017 baseline is that Social Security recipients and [[00:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3516.3s)]

*  his Charlie hates the salt deduction which helps people really in the tri-state area who have very [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3592.7s)]
*  high state taxes and he's a Floridian and rightly feels he should not be subsidizing our terrible [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3597.54s)]
*  tax policies by allowing these write-offs but some of them got put back in thanks to some House [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3603.7799999999997s)]
*  Republicans whose support they really needed was that your least favorite thing about the bill [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3609.62s)]
*  Charlie or what what's your least favorite well that is by far and away my least favorite thing [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3615.34s)]
*  about the bill yes I think it's really unfair as a matter of law but I also think that it is poor [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3620.3s)]
*  conservative policy to pass a big subsidy for profligate blue states you just saw this Mamdani [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3626.06s)]
*  guy in New York is probably gonna be the next mayor there's zero reason the people in Florida [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3632.74s)]
*  or Texas or Tennessee or Wyoming or wherever should be paying more for the same federal [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3639.1s)]
*  government purely because blue states can't get their act together the other part I don't like [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3644.14s)]
*  and I understand the politics of it but is the Social Security tax reduction because we have a [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3649.38s)]
*  huge problem with our entitlements and mathematically there's no difference between reducing taxes on [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3657.34s)]
*  Social Security recipients and increasing the cost of Social Security this is however much it costs [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3663.78s)]
*  you know 40 billion 50 billion a year half a trillion dollars over 10 years perhaps that is [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3669.54s)]
*  the equivalent of increasing Social Security payments by that much which may or may not be a [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3674.3s)]
*  good idea in a vacuum but we're now spending a trillion dollars a year on debt repayment and [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3678.9s)]
*  when our big problem is entitlement so I think this is really truly irresponsible those two things [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3683.3s)]
*  together I would not have done rich I have to mention this the Dan Crenshaw tried to get a [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3687.98s)]
*  piece into the BBB defunding any money for trans medical procedures whether it's for minors or [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3696.94s)]
*  for adults on the federal dollar like you can't use Medicaid or Medicare or state funds to fund [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3706.58s)]
*  these procedures and I love that he tried to do that and I tip my hat to him for trying he tried [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3713.46s)]
*  hard it got taken out of the reconciliation bill by the mean awful Senate parliamentarian who gets [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3719.14s)]
*  to strike things from the bill that she doesn't think really are budget related okay so that's [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3728.46s)]
*  her but she took it out and then he convinced the Republicans to put it back in and force the [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3735.7400000000002s)]
*  Democrats to object to it it got taken out a half an hour before they voted on it I think the [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3743.42s)]
*  parliamentarian was back and took it out again or at least that's how it appears but the reason [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3749.42s)]
*  I'm raising all this is to give credit where it's due because we we wanted that in there and it was [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3756.1400000000003s)]
*  worth trying for and also because Dan Crenshaw posted about his attempt to do this on X and then [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3762.06s)]

*  programs and the feds invariably pay far more than the states do but in North Carolina he points out [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3977.34s)]
*  that what happened was I'm trying to get to the actual numbers here he said for every one dollar [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3983.9s)]
*  a state puts towards Medicaid Congress matches it with something between one dollar and nine dollar [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3989.58s)]
*  Congress will contribute if the state sacrifices something to fund its own program already he [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=3995.42s)]
*  writes this is a boon to state officials if they raise taxes by one dollar inflicting one dollar of [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4001.58s)]

*  good way to run a constitutional republic though given that the issues here are about the federal [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4171.9800000000005s)]
*  budget not whether we like Donald Trump and I actually think Tom Tillis is completely wrong [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4176.9400000000005s)]
*  on the Medicaid issue like you do but there has to be some room between I like the president and [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4182.54s)]
*  I want to evaluate independently what Congress and the president want to do with [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4189.5s)]
*  legislation so I think it's a general rule the way that we have begun to turn the president to the [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4195.0199999999995s)]
*  pope is a bad thing but yeah Trump has a lot of sway and if he turns on a given member then that [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4201.58s)]
*  member usually caves Tillis hasn't so he's retiring Thomas Massey in the house hasn't [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4212.14s)]
*  caved either he's not retiring but he is being primaried so I guess we'll see what happens when [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4220.06s)]
*  somebody the early indications are not great for him early indications are that's true I mean [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4225.5s)]
*  looks good yeah although 52 percent of people said they were undecided so I wonder which way [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4231.900000000001s)]
*  they'll break house districts are also a little bit different than entire states it's probably [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4237.18s)]
*  easier in some respects to hang on as a house member in a unusual part of the country than it [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4242.22s)]
*  is if you're being elected let me just interrupt you and get you to get you to a related point [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4248.06s)]
*  that you've been making that I'd love for our audience to hear and that is you know you're [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4252.54s)]
*  what you're saying here is okay yes Trump is very powerful within the Republican Party but we do have [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4257.18s)]
*  a constitutional system and people need to live by it and you've been making a similar point in [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4262.94s)]
*  response to some of these Supreme Court rulings that I know we both like and I agree with you [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4267.98s)]
*  like we talked last week about the ruling on Friday on how these national injunctions [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4272.78s)]
*  that that district court after district court you know issues have been struck down basically by the [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4279.339999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court saying these are inappropriate a federal district court judge does not have this [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4285.82s)]
*  power over the executive and left alone without more that really does empower the executive branch [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4289.26s)]
*  and we may feel fine about that some of us while President Trump is in there but he won't be in [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4297.74s)]
*  there forever you could god forbid get a Kamala Harris in there who's super newly empowered too [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4301.820000000001s)]
*  by that ruling and your point is maybe now would be a great time for Congress since GOP controls [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4307.74s)]
*  both branches of it and the White House to enact a law that reduces the overall power of the [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4315.1s)]
*  president consistent with the way the founders envisioned this country working yeah and I think [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4321.58s)]
*  there's a paradox or what looks like a paradox here because I think the court largely got the [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4328.38s)]
*  decision you referenced right I also think there are some cases pending about presidential power [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4332.700000000001s)]
*  that ought to be decided in the president's favor Humphrey's executive for example the problem is [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4338.54s)]
*  if the court does that but it doesn't also restore power to Congress or more reasonably [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4343.5s)]
*  in the interim Congress doesn't take power back that it has then what you've ended up with is [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4350.78s)]
*  a system in which the president's all powerful if you look through a lot of our laws this has been [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4356.7s)]
*  true since the new deal but it's got worse and worse and worse in the last 30 years they have [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4361.82s)]
*  lines in them that say things like the secretary shall or in the judgment of the secretary or in [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4367.26s)]
*  the opinion of the president that's not really lawmaking sometimes that's necessary but that's [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4371.9s)]
*  not lawmaking Congress should be filling in those judgments and those opinions but it isn't and so [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4377.42s)]
*  my worry with this decision last week is that if the lower courts aren't going to get involved [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4384.0599999999995s)]
*  and issue nationwide injunctions which I think are problematic and the president's going to make up [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4390.219999999999s)]
*  the law as we have seen sometimes with Trump but we saw really week in week out with Joe Biden [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4395.82s)]
*  then you end up with a situation in which the president can say for example he's going to try [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4401.66s)]
*  and spend half a trillion dollars on student loans that he's not allowed to do a congress that doesn't [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4407.419999999999s)]
*  step in and fix that and a court system that is slow and that case works its way up to the [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4413.179999999999s)]
*  supreme court and in the meantime maybe the president spent you know 200 billion dollars [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4419.259999999999s)]
*  without congress so yeah congress really does have to get its act together and I know that this sounds [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4423.74s)]
*  like a partisan point because the the democrats say this when there's a republican president and [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4429.98s)]
*  the republicans say this when there's a democratic president but if we wanted to congress could get [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4436.54s)]
*  together both parties and just take away a lot of presidential power that it has willingly deferred [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4441.58s)]
*  it should do that but it hasn't done that so I just hope that decision which I think was right [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4447.259999999999s)]
*  legally doesn't end up with yet more presidential authority that can't be checked by the other [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4451.74s)]
*  it's not going to happen under president trump I think we can all agree like maybe if you had a [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4457.42s)]
*  john mccain in there and a democrat controlled congress something like that would be possible [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4461.5s)]
*  but we're on a freight train toward more and more presidential power and maybe hopefully that'll [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4467.26s)]
*  cause us to be really careful in selecting the next guy or gal okay keep keeping forward going [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4471.42s)]
*  forward Elon still hates the BBB he's not shy about it he's been saying a lot like if this thing passes [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4478.860000000001s)]
*  I'm forming the save America party I think it is the America something party the very next day and [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4487.5s)]
*  also threatening to primary anyone who votes for it which means every republican rich I mean yeah [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4493.66s)]
*  speaking of riches he is but that's a lot of money to primary every single republican hold on I'm [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4500.9400000000005s)]
*  gonna set it up for you yeah and now trump gets asked about asked about some of the antagonism [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4507.5s)]
*  by Elon and says this at the White House this morning before he went down to Florida [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4513.26s)]
*  I don't know I think we'll have to think a little we might have to put [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4520.06s)]
*  you know you know doges doges the monster that have that might have to go back and eat Elon [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4525.5s)]
*  would not be terrible he gets a lot of subsidies Peter but Elon's very upset that the EV mandate [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4531.42s)]
*  is going to be terminated and you know what when you look at it even who wants not everybody wants [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4540.06s)]
*  an electric car I don't want an electric car I want to have baby gasoline maybe electric [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4545.02s)]
*  maybe a hybrid maybe someday a hydrogen if you have a hydrogen car it has one problem it blows [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4550.62s)]
*  up you know so I'm going to give that one to Peter to let Peter [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4557.18s)]
*  turn it up [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4561.02s)]
*  okay even Charlie's laughing at that one he's funny he's funny he's the funniest president we've ever [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4567.900000000001s)]
*  had it's just true I don't know why people who don't like him can't admit this he's hilarious [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4573.42s)]
*  it's so rich yes of course maybe we're just about deporting asked about deporting Elon he's going to [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4579.18s)]
*  say court yeah we're looking at it right kicking it around says about everything he's not going to [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4584.46s)]
*  deport Elon and look Elon is a genius he's just not a genius at politics and there are a lot of [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4589.18s)]
*  reasons for having a man crush on Donald Trump the way he professed to have to be very enthusiastic [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4594.62s)]
*  about electing him last year to be jumping on stage and bearing his midriff all that but one [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4599.66s)]
*  of them was not the the conviction that Donald Trump would would deal with the debt or seriously [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4604.3s)]
*  reform entitlements which is a necessary step to dealing with with the debt he just occasionally [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4611.5s)]
*  mentions he's going to do it but it's clearly not a priority and he's been very explicit that he's [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4616.54s)]
*  not going to touch entitlements which makes it impossible of fiscal impossibility mathematical [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4621.02s)]
*  impossibility to deal with the debt so Elon shouldn't be surprised by what happened here [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4625.02s)]
*  and maybe he's going to form a party but but the idea that they're just a bunch of people on the [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4631.02s)]
*  sidelines who are really into entitlement reform and deficit reduction they're going to go out and [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4636.14s)]
*  primary all these guys and put the fear of God in them is is never going to happen he does not [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4642.22s)]
*  have anything like the political clout that Donald Trump does and going back to the the [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4647.34s)]
*  Harry Enton point about how popular Trump is among Republicans there have been other Republican [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4652.54s)]
*  presidents who are popular among Republicans although there might be a unique bond here [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4656.7s)]
*  but what's different is if you're a Tom Tillis and and you cross some conventional Republican [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4661.18s)]
*  president in the past that president might be PO'd at you might in private let it be known that [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4666.3s)]
*  that he's upset with you he might put his political consultants to work to defeat you in a primary in [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4671.26s)]
*  a year or two what's different with Trump he instantly wields his power he blasts you in public [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4677.02s)]
*  a lot of the the Trump-friendly media picks up on it they'll blast you as well and you'll go to a [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4682.9400000000005s)]
*  town hall the next day like the next day and like two-thirds of your voters will hate you right yeah [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4688.700000000001s)]
*  who wants to deal with that no one wants to to deal with that and maybe you know if you're unique [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4693.900000000001s)]
*  and have you know John McCain may have been this you know Susan Collins certainly is where you're [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4699.02s)]
*  kind of in a non-red state and have a real distinct brand and different political base you can survive [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4704.22s)]
*  that Trump onslaught otherwise you're not you're just not so you can do what Tillis did vote against [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4710.780000000001s)]
*  it but you are either going to have to be you will likely be defeated in primary or take the easy way [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4715.660000000001s)]
*  out and retire so this is a unique form of of presidential power which goes to the hold he has [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4720.38s)]
*  among Republicans and his willingness to wield it in a blunt force manner immediately there is a [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4726.38s)]
*  bug in my studio that's been harassing me the entire I apologize it's like if you can't I'm [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4735.66s)]
*  not having a fit on the air I'm trying to get this bug out of the way for me yeah you're exactly right [[01:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4740.3s)]
*  about all of that and I think you know eventually Elon will come to terms with the fact that this is [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4745.42s)]
*  going to pass it has to pass Trump's entire presidency depends on this passing but I understand [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4749.42s)]
*  his frustration because he got sent in there to go dogeify the federal government and he really [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4755.18s)]
*  couldn't he tried but there were so many roadblocks with given the way our administrative law works and [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4760.38s)]
*  you know how you're really kind of not allowed to fire certain people or touch certain things [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4766.06s)]
*  it was incredibly frustrating for those of us who were rooting for him we had dinner last night with [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4770.700000000001s)]
*  um a friend of ours from Argentina and he was telling us how much Argentinians love Javier [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4775.02s)]
*  Malay and how you know inflation was out of control he was saying in Argentina you'd go to a store [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4781.02s)]
*  it'd be closed on a random Wednesday at two o'clock in the afternoon and you'd say why are you closed [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4787.26s)]
*  when they open back up and they said because we didn't know what the inflation would be today [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4793.18s)]
*  or whether we could afford to like be in business today selling goods with the with the prices as [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4796.700000000001s)]
*  they are that's how Argentina was before he got there yeah so he they love Javier Malay and he was [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4801.580000000001s)]
*  able to go in there with his chainsaw and start slashing all these government agencies in a way [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4808.86s)]
*  you just can't do here given the way we're set up and how many layers of bureaucracy there there [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4813.58s)]
*  are between you and meaningful cuts and I think Charlie when I look at Elon's comments today [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4818.7s)]
*  because he one of his comments his response to that Trump sought was something like I'm gonna with [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4823.339999999999s)]
*  I'm gonna restrain myself right now I I am restraining myself from responding so that's good [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4828.78s)]
*  he's doing that but you can feel his frustration I think his determination to actually make real [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4836.14s)]
*  cuts to government spending is real and it's next to impossible yes Elon Musk is a genius he's a [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4841.1s)]
*  genius in the great American tradition of genius he is extremely strange which is usual among geniuses [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4851.1s)]
*  in fact many American geniuses especially in the invention realm are also awful people which I'm [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4862.06s)]
*  not sure Elon is but he is a very strange brilliant eccentric American genius and his genius is not in [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4869.26s)]
*  politics it's in other things and in fact it's in things that very often make understanding politics [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4879.02s)]
*  difficult one of the famous stories I was taught in college about American politics was Jimmy Carter [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4886.46s)]
*  with an energy bill and Jimmy Carter had some expertise in energy and he thought when the time [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4893.740000000001s)]
*  for the energy bill to be written came up that he would just look at the country and its energy [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4899.42s)]
*  needs and they would all sit around as experts and they would work out what to do and then they would [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4906.54s)]
*  go to congress and everyone would say wow what a brilliant bill and they pass it but of course [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4911.26s)]
*  that's not how it worked people had different political opinions some people were irrational [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4915.66s)]
*  others didn't want this or that plant in their state energy prices had fluctuated in one part [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4921.66s)]
*  of the country and not another part there were things going on in the middle east and Carter [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4927.58s)]
*  became very very frustrated by this because fundamentally he didn't understand politics [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4932.3s)]
*  and I think that's true of Elon Musk as well it is simply not the case I wish desperately that it [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4936.54s)]
*  were but it is simply not the case that there is this great mass of people in the American middle [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4942.22s)]
*  who are desperate to reform entitlements or fix the budget they might tell you if asked that they [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4947.1s)]

*  to do the what to do about it part some of them want to cut taxes some of them want to raise taxes [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4958.14s)]
*  some of them want to cut spending a lot of them might say they want to cut spending but then it's [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4963.9800000000005s)]
*  what gets cut oh could we not cut foreign aid well actually foreign aid's not too much of the budget [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4967.820000000001s)]
*  okay what is well defense is some of it let's cut that oh so you don't want us to be as strong as [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4972.22s)]

*  get back into exactly the same political fight that we've all been having for 50 years you can't [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4992.3s)]
*  just create a third party that's going to solve this the reason that we have our two parties [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=4997.34s)]
*  and are full of people who have different views within them the reason there's a left wing of the [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5003.34s)]
*  democratic party and a more moderate wing of the democratic party the reason that there is a maga [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5007.42s)]
*  wing of the republican party and then the me wing which is you know cut cut cut cut is that americans [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5011.58s)]
*  have strong political opinions they can't agree among themselves so musk can't solve this in the [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5018.860000000001s)]
*  way that he can solve say a rocket trajectory where he sits with the most brilliant people he [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5023.66s)]
*  knows and they do all the math and physics on a piece of paper it's just not how politics works [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5029.18s)]
*  it's how a lot of very smart people think politics ought to work but it's not how politics does work [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5033.98s)]
*  so no he's not going to do this what he should do if he wants to change politics is invest and [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5039.099999999999s)]
*  this will take 20 years and a lot of money a lot of time a lot of frustration he should invest [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5046.78s)]
*  in persuading people within the republican party that they should side with him and success would [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5051.820000000001s)]
*  look like another 10 15 percent of republicans being open to elon musk's ideas over 20 years [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5058.54s)]

*  somebody once saw a swan there they're worried that there are any deportations whatsoever they [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5573.42s)]
*  are people who have abolished ice t-shirts and who go to protests and who think that there is [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5581.02s)]
*  something intrinsically wrong without having borders in the first place so the objections seem [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5585.820000000001s)]
*  overblown to me i have a legit question for you rich if you had to choose running through a field [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5591.34s)]
*  of alligators or running through a field of pythons which one would you choose [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5599.660000000001s)]
*  hmm pythons i think they're they're less likely to get you really yeah but uh the trump has just [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5604.3s)]
*  been as funniest on this he has asked about it was it yesterday yesterday i think and someone said [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5612.3s)]
*  mr president do you want reptiles to eat the the illegal immigrants they try to escape it's like [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5617.02s)]
*  yeah i think i think that's the concept and they said like the snakes are really fast and then he [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5620.9400000000005s)]
*  you know said you have to do the zigzag thing to run away oh wait i have that part we have that [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5626.06s)]
*  let's let's play that one um that's where is it hold on 20 yeah it's not so 20 [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5630.22s)]
*  i guess that's the concept this is not a nice business i guess that's the concept if you [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5643.58s)]
*  you know uh snakes are fast but alligators but we're going to teach them how to run away from [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5649.740000000001s)]
*  an alligator okay if they escape prison how to run away don't run in a straight line run like this [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5656.3s)]
*  and you know what your chances go up about one percent okay [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5663.02s)]
*  z serpentine that's what you're supposed to do serpentine if an alligator is chasing you [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5670.62s)]
*  apparently you're not i was listening to washington post piece about this charlie is the expert but i [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5674.54s)]
*  was listening to washington post pieces but extremely derisive about the whole thing of course [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5678.78s)]
*  and one of his fact checks in the course of the pieces he's wrong this is outdated advice he [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5682.7s)]
*  actually should race run straight when you're uh when you're being chased by by an alligator [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5686.7s)]
*  but look the this is so funny the alliteration is great serves the the administration's purposes [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5691.5s)]
*  uh a little bit in two ways one just creating a deterrent effect right they want to get the [[01:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5697.0199999999995s)]
*  message out why don't you just go home on your own we'll give you a thousand dollar credit whatever [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5701.82s)]
*  it is to help you get home on on your own rather than dealing with these alligators and two they [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5705.66s)]
*  seriously need detention space i mean this this is a serious limit on what they're doing the lack [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5710.62s)]
*  of detention space so uh good good on uh desantis are doing this other republican governors should [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5715.58s)]
*  do something similar then it also serves the catastrophic purposes of right the left and the [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5721.58s)]
*  media oh my god you know what i just first heard of this idea and got a little bit of a notion of [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5726.22s)]
*  it from from reading headlines and and just hearing it half discussed on tv i thought oh [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5731.42s)]
*  they're dredging the everglades to create this new facility maybe that is a problem but of course [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5736.14s)]
*  it already exists the facility they're just building it was an airfield yeah on this [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5741.26s)]
*  unused uh airfield but uh as charlie says at the end of the day their objection is not the [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5745.18s)]
*  environment or anything else it's like they don't like deportations and it makes it much harder to do [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5751.26s)]
*  deportations if you don't have this kind of space i look forward to seeing aoc down there and like [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5755.82s)]
*  a beekeeper suit yeah yeah yeah protector from the miskeos right so sad about the alligator risks [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5760.94s)]
*  um i will say something jumped out at me in the reporting which was that [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5768.78s)]
*  right and number of lander will go down there and get attacked by an alligator [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5773.74s)]
*  yeah we'll make a whole series out of it yeah that um we've had a record high number of [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5777.259999999999s)]
*  detentions totaling this is uh per the ap more than 56 000 as of june that's the most since 2019 [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5783.42s)]
*  that's depressing we've only gotten rid of 56 000 charlie and that's under trump and homin [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5793.26s)]
*  that i mean we're on pace to get what a hundred thousand this year maybe a hunt maybe if we're [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5801.66s)]
*  lucky half a million in the trump presidency out of the what 10 12 20 even possibly illegals who [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5807.42s)]
*  came in just under biden never mind those that were here before it's like i i'm all for alligator [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5816.7s)]
*  alcatraz and all that it's just these are teaspoons in the ocean they are and it is depressing but i [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5823.0199999999995s)]
*  would add a couple of caveats the first thing is there are not many people coming in and that's a [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5830.3s)]
*  huge achievement the border is secure in a way that it never was under biden second it is quite [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5836.54s)]
*  difficult in a free country like the united states it's much freer than pretty much everywhere [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5844.86s)]
*  else to stage mass deportations because we have a lot of constitutional rights i'm not talking [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5849.74s)]
*  about the rights of people who are illegal who can be deported with limited due process i've just [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5855.66s)]
*  been asked a general rule we don't run everything we do past the government and that makes it more [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5861.58s)]
*  difficult to get rid of the people who are here illegally and the third thing is that the deterrent [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5866.54s)]
*  effect should over time especially if it is accompanied by changes to the law for example [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5873.42s)]
*  the implementation of e-verify would be a good idea encourage people who are here illegally to [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5880.62s)]
*  go home without us having to put them in you know alligator alcatraz or put them on a plane that [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5887.58s)]
*  we're paying for one of the other things that biden and the democratic party has done other [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5894.78s)]
*  than leave the border open is give all sorts of services to illegal immigrants and make it quite [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5901.18s)]
*  easy to be an illegal immigrant in the united states and the republicans ought to prioritize [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5907.66s)]
*  reversing that i'm not talking about being mean to people but if you are here illegally it should [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5913.1s)]
*  be more difficult than it is to get a job it should be more difficult than it is to enroll your kids [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5918.46s)]
*  in school or to use social services so those sorts of changes can do a lot of the work for the [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5923.26s)]
*  government without them having to physically put people on government planes it's just it's just [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5927.9s)]
*  mind-boggling to me megan that 10 years now being such a harsh immigration hawk trump has not endorsed [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5932.0599999999995s)]
*  a robust e-verify system that would be mandatory because the chamber of commerce republicans [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5937.98s)]
*  yeah so the problem is he's of two minds on this right he he wants to deport illegal immigrants but [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5944.379999999999s)]
*  he also has a lot of sympathy for these employers especially in the hospitality business right [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5949.5s)]
*  something he knows a lot about that will be squeezed if it's harder to employ illegal immigrants so [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5954.62s)]
*  you got to decide one way or the other and the only way to get there get the numbers up big [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5960.14s)]
*  is to have more self-deportations because the rifle shot approach it is teaspoons in the ocean [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5965.18s)]
*  as you say very resource intensive where someone just decides to go home you don't have to touch [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5971.34s)]
*  them you don't have to detain them you don't have to send them to alligator alcatraz they just do it [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5976.54s)]
*  on their own the same way they came in so just to update my numbers yeah my my trusty producers [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5980.62s)]
*  point out that 56 000 immigrants detained that was actually just for june so that's good but we've [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5986.3s)]
*  only gotten about 139 000 total out which is less good but not notwithstanding this an effort you [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5992.54s)]
*  know like unlike we've ever seen before fyi pythons can kill you primarily through constriction which [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=5999.34s)]
*  seems like it would take longer than for an alligator to eat you so you have convinced me [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=6005.5s)]
*  i said you can just run run past the pythons and it's just more if they slowly get a grip on your [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=6009.98s)]
*  your ankle but i still have a trust in my speed to get get through this field of pythons python [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=6015.259999999999s)]
*  prison as the as the guys at real clear politics said that's that's less lethal than alligator [[01:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=6020.459999999999s)]
*  alcatraz i'm glad we settled it thanks guys thank you all right we're on ditty verdict watch and [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=6025.179999999999s)]
*  we'll go live on youtube just as soon as we have that for you [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dUf2LxfwzXM&t=6032.3s)]
