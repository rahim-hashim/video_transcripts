Then Tim Dillon, whose new Netflix special is "I'm Your Mother," to discuss his very short child acting career, his journey from drug use to sobriety, being raised by Irish Catholics, why Meghan Markle is one of America’s greatest con artists, her launch of overpriced everyday products, her tone-deaf new podcast about female founders, Gavin Newsom’s failed podcast, his opportunistic political strategy lacking actual beliefs, how Tim became friends with RFK Jr. and Cheryl Hines, his support for Trump’s stance on bringing actual help to the working and middle class, how the political parties have completely switched sides in the last 20 years, the rise of superficial identity politics, and more.

# Con Artist Meghan Markle's Grift, and New Blake Lively Questions, with Tim Dillon, Aidala & Eiglarsh
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 11, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show and happy Friday. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1.6s)]
*  Later, we've got Tim Dillon here with me in studio. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4.44s)]
*  I cannot wait to see him. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=8.8s)]
*  You know this guy, he's brilliant. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=10.34s)]
*  He is so funny and clever. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=12.36s)]
*  He came on, I looked it up, it was like episode 50. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=14.6s)]
*  I think it was episode 50, right in there, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=18.62s)]
*  between 50 and 60 of the show. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  This is when we were in the kids' playroom, only audio. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=22.88s)]
*  We loved him back then. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=26.44s)]
*  He was so funny. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=27.52s)]
*  I remember just crying. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=28.6s)]
*  I was laughing so hard. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=29.88s)]
*  And then we had him again a couple years later [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=30.84s)]
*  and now he's back and I can't wait to talk to him in person. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=32.8s)]
*  I've never met him in person. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=36.0s)]
*  Anyway, it's gonna be great. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=37.64s)]
*  So prepare to have fun in our second hour. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=38.64s)]
*  But we begin with a different kind of fun, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=41.08s)]
*  a fun that everybody loves and that's Kelly's Court. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=43.44s)]
*  And there's a ton to get to. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=46.68s)]
*  We've got some interesting and bizarre debates [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  popping up about a lot of stories in the news, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=50.8s)]
*  including that terrible stabbing [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=53.44s)]
*  of the high school football player down in Texas. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  Plus we've got big updates with Diddy, Harvey Weinstein, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=58.839999999999996s)]
*  Brian Kohlberger, and Blake Lively. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=61.839999999999996s)]
*  And here to discuss it all are the OG Kelly's Court panelists [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=64.44s)]
*  back when it was Kendall's Court, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=70.36s)]
*  Arthur Idalla, trial attorney and managing partner [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=72.03999999999999s)]
*  at Idalla, Bertuna, and Kamen's PC, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=74.52s)]
*  and host of the Arthur Idalla Power Hour, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=76.75999999999999s)]
*  and Mark Iglarich, criminal defense attorney [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=80.28s)]
*  at Iglarich Law, which you can find at speaktomark.com. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=82.36s)]

*  Okay, so you're thinking about what to get that person [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=93.64s)]
*  who has everything, or maybe you are that person [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=95.88s)]
*  that has everything and you just happen [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=98.76s)]
*  to appreciate the finer things. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=100.2s)]
*  Well, look, we're coming up on Mother's Day and Father's Day. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=101.64s)]
*  And it's always hard to buy for those, right? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=104.80000000000001s)]
*  Like another flower, come on, try harder. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=106.76s)]
*  Try hot salt. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=110.80000000000001s)]
*  Yes, I said it, hot salt, exquisite hot salt. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=112.0s)]
*  Exquisite, savory heat. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=116.36s)]
*  Now you're interested, so let me tell you [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=118.6s)]
*  about Firecracker Farm. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=119.92s)]
*  It's a wonderful little family company that makes hot salt, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=121.32s)]
*  a delightful spice-infused sea salt. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=124.88s)]
*  It has the perfect amount of heat and amazing flavor [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=127.92s)]
*  that makes everything taste better. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=130.2s)]
*  Word is getting out and people are loving it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=132.07999999999998s)]
*  That is because it's made with love. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=134.48s)]
*  People can feel it and taste it. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=136.32s)]
*  It's a small batch, family operation, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=138.2s)]
*  so supplies are limited. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=140.48s)]
*  It comes in sleek stainless steel push grinders, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=141.96s)]
*  but you can take them anywhere. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=144.64000000000001s)]
*  When you run out, they have refills. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=146.08s)]
*  A little too spicy for you? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=147.88s)]
*  Just mix it in with some regular sea salt to tame the heat, [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=149.12s)]
*  but you won't need to. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=152.24s)]
*  It's blended to perfection. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=153.4s)]
*  Honestly, it's the best thing to happen to food since fire. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=155.16s)]
*  So what are you waiting for? [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=157.6s)]

*  I love speaking to Mark. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=174.08s)]
*  I love speaking to Mark. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=175.24s)]
*  It's like my favorite thing to do, Meg and Kelly. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=176.28s)]
*  Same. I love speaking to Mark. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=178.28s)]
*  I love talking to him. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=180.0s)]
*  Yeah, sure. Why not? [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=180.96s)]
*  Okay. So let's start. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=183.36s)]
*  There's a lot of places we can start. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=185.48000000000002s)]
*  Why? Well, why don't we just kick it off with this? [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=186.8s)]
*  Since our pal Arthur over here is going back to court [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=188.96s)]
*  for Harvey Weinstein, who thanks to Arthur, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=194.88000000000002s)]
*  we talked about this when he did it, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=198.12s)]
*  has a new trial in New York on these criminal allegations [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=200.56s)]
*  against him that he's a sexual pervert. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=204.0s)]
*  And Arthur represented him in the trial, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=206.6s)]
*  but he got convicted. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=209.24s)]
*  But then Arthur got the conviction thrown out [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=210.07999999999998s)]
*  because they let everybody and her mother take the stand, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=212.48s)]
*  even people who weren't plaintiffs or victims [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=215.76s)]
*  alleged in the case. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=218.4s)]
*  And the court of appeals of New York state said, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=220.72s)]
*  you can't do that. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=222.76s)]
*  That wasn't fair to Mr. Weinstein. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=223.88s)]
*  So now he's back in court [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=225.32s)]
*  and the jury selection begins on Tuesday? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=227.0s)]
*  Yeah, jury selection begins on Tuesday. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  And Megan, that's honestly, that's the biggest hurdle here. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=232.2s)]
*  It's, you know, 90% of the cases, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=234.48s)]
*  99% of the cases Mark and I are involved with, [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=237.35999999999999s)]
*  you know, you walk into a courtroom [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=240.28s)]
*  and jurors don't know who the defendant is. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=241.51999999999998s)]
*  They don't know what the charges are. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=243.32s)]
*  You know, you have a clean slate. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=245.07999999999998s)]
*  So at least you have a shot at the jury [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=246.6s)]
*  reaching a verdict based on the evidence they hear in court. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=249.88s)]
*  Here, the huge hurdle we have is, God forbid, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=252.76s)]
*  they base the evidence on what they see on TMZ [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=255.68s)]
*  or People Magazine or something along those lines. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=258.88s)]
*  So the jury selection part is gonna be tedious [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=261.35999999999996s)]
*  because we're gonna ask, okay, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=264.76s)]
*  can we have a raise of hands? [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=266.67999999999995s)]
*  Who knows who this is? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=268.32s)]
*  Okay, fine. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=269.96s)]
*  And then when you say, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=271.23999999999995s)]
*  raise your hands if you know about this case, [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  you then need to call them in the back individually [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=275.0s)]
*  because you don't want them to blurt out, [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=277.35999999999996s)]
*  oh yeah, I know Harvey's a rapist and he's a bad guy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=279.2s)]
*  and he killed his this and killed his cat. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=281.67999999999995s)]
*  And so one at a time, you have to ask them what they know [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=283.59999999999997s)]
*  and whether they can get over [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  their own personal knowledge, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=288.44s)]
*  which is the hard drive of their brain, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=289.91999999999996s)]
*  to then just base their verdict on the facts [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=292.28s)]
*  that they're gonna hear in this trial. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=294.96s)]
*  Not a trial in California, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=296.67999999999995s)]
*  not a trial in New York five years ago, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=298.28s)]
*  not some documentary on Netflix. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=300.52s)]
*  So jury selection here, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=303.4s)]
*  probably more than any case I've ever been involved with, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=304.76s)]
*  is probably the most important part of the whole case. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=307.12s)]
*  And Megan, let me say something about Arthur and this case. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=311.23999999999995s)]
*  He won't tell you this, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=315.4s)]
*  but it is so much more challenging the second time around [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=316.36s)]
*  because now you've got the trial transcripts, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=320.04s)]
*  thousands and thousands of extra pages [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=322.8s)]
*  that you didn't have in the first trial. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=325.76s)]
*  And you must go through every word line by line [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=328.2s)]
*  to use for your advantage. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=332.64s)]
*  So Arthur is being very generous with his time right now [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=334.68s)]
*  because if it was me, I'd be knee deep in preparation. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=337.88s)]
*  I know, I'm kind of amazed he's here. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=340.84s)]
*  Yeah, and Megan, talking to you as a friend, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=344.0s)]
*  the hardest part right now, honestly, is my kids. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=346.0s)]
*  Like I have a three-year-old and an eight-year-old [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=349.0s)]
*  and I barely seen them. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=352.0s)]
*  And it's my, after this opening day of baseball on Saturday, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=354.28s)]
*  so I'll be there for two hours. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=358.0s)]
*  And then I come back to the office and his face just drops. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=359.32s)]
*  He's like, daddy, you gotta go to work again? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=362.24s)]
*  But you have someone's life in their hands. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=364.68s)]
*  And if Harvey gets convicted, he's gonna die in prison. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=366.2s)]
*  Three-day man, end of story. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=368.88s)]
*  And that's an enormous amount of pressure. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  It's gonna be a five, six week thing. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=372.28s)]
*  And I will tell you this, I'll give you guys a little preview. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=374.08s)]
*  I am seriously, this isn't Huffery, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=376.88s)]
*  seriously contemplating putting him on this stand [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=379.55999999999995s)]
*  because it's basically, it's a he said, she said. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=381.96s)]
*  There is no other evidence. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=384.11999999999995s)]
*  There's no medical evidence. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=385.64s)]
*  There's no video. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=387.52s)]
*  There's, it's just their word. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=388.67999999999995s)]
*  And I think in today's day and age, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=391.0s)]
*  I think a jury wants to say, look, if you didn't do it, guy, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=392.4s)]
*  you come up here and tell us you didn't do it. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=397.0s)]
*  So, and Mark will tell you, [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=398.79999999999995s)]
*  it's the most excruciating decision the fed has to make. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=400.2s)]
*  But- [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=404.15999999999997s)]
*  Of course, Arthur, I feel for you. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=405.0s)]
*  If it- [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=407.15999999999997s)]
*  We're probably going to Rikers Island this weekend [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=408.0s)]
*  to start prepping him just so that, [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=409.2s)]
*  no, we're ready to go if he needs to take the stand. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=411.2s)]
*  I hope it doesn't come down to it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=413.56s)]
*  because that's the one time you cannot control that guy. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=415.24s)]
*  And you're not gonna find, [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=417.91999999999996s)]
*  it's gonna be difficult to find a unanimous jury [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=419.48s)]
*  that actually likes him. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=422.8s)]
*  And I say that generically, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=424.8s)]
*  it's hard for all the jurors to like your client. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=426.03999999999996s)]
*  But like can't be the goal when it's Harvey. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=428.32s)]
*  But isn't the goal, Arthur, correct me if I'm wrong, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=431.24s)]
*  isn't the goal, you're not gonna love this guy. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=433.88s)]
*  I can see that upfront. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=437.59999999999997s)]
*  This is not somebody you want marrying your daughter. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=439.48s)]
*  But he did not commit sexual crimes against these women. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=442.24s)]
*  These women said yes, these women went along with it. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=447.96s)]
*  They had career aspirations. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=450.76s)]
*  They didn't make clear to him [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=452.88s)]
*  that they were unwilling participants [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=454.24s)]
*  only after the fact when the Me Too era came along [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=456.48s)]
*  was it suddenly, I was a crime victim in that moment. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=459.56s)]
*  He's good, Arthur, you should bring her on. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=463.44s)]
*  Okay, almost decades later when the complaints made, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=465.44s)]
*  and it's no secret because it's out there in the public, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=469.68s)]
*  they all received a lot of money, [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=472.68s)]
*  like hundreds of thousands of dollars. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=474.24s)]
*  So, look, we have something to work with. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=477.16s)]
*  If this was not Harvey Weiss, if this was Harvey Jones, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  and a jury came in and knew nothing about this, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=483.20000000000005s)]
*  I would be very confident. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=485.76000000000005s)]
*  Right now, Mr. Eichloss, the two words I would love to hear [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=487.24s)]
*  is hung jury or mistrial at the end of the case [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=490.12s)]
*  because they said the preconceived notions [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=493.88000000000005s)]
*  that people have going into that courtroom [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=496.84000000000003s)]
*  is really the Mount Everest we have to climb. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, there's no presumption of innocent. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=500.96000000000004s)]
*  I know, but I have to say, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=503.16s)]
*  I think maybe I'm the exception, [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=504.16s)]
*  but even though I've listened to countless testimonials [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=505.56s)]
*  by women who said that they were the victims [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=509.92s)]
*  of a Me Too situation, [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=512.32s)]
*  I think I could go in there and say, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=513.9599999999999s)]
*  but I will judge this case based on the evidence [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=516.8399999999999s)]
*  that is put before me and figure out [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=519.4399999999999s)]
*  whether in these incidents brought to me, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=521.36s)]
*  he committed a crime. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=523.5999999999999s)]
*  I really think I could do it. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=525.3199999999999s)]
*  I think my fellow New Yorkers can do it. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=526.36s)]
*  I mean, New Yorkers are tough as balls. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=527.8s)]
*  They're smart. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=529.28s)]
*  I think you could do it, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=531.24s)]
*  but Manhattan jury pool where Donald Trump [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=533.9599999999999s)]
*  got 17% of the vote, [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=537.24s)]
*  I just think there's just so inclined. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  But it's not a Republican Democrat thing. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=541.48s)]
*  Republicans don't like sexual crimes. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=543.4s)]
*  I know, but they're very much, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=547.36s)]
*  they were all about believe all women. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=549.6800000000001s)]
*  They were all about the attorney general, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=551.24s)]
*  Letitia James, believe all women, believe all women. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=552.8000000000001s)]
*  They lean heavily in that direction. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=555.2s)]
*  And they believe the media too. [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=557.4s)]
*  That's another problem. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=558.88s)]
*  Once they've read something in black and white, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=559.84s)]
*  a lot erroneously think that that's the truth. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=562.6800000000001s)]
*  It's hard to overcome. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=565.04s)]
*  Well, I think if you're worried about [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=565.88s)]
*  believe all women, Arthur, [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=567.48s)]
*  I would say that you don't need my advice to try a case, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=568.4s)]
*  but I mean, you might want to hit that one [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=571.2s)]
*  right on the head and say, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=574.1600000000001s)]
*  I understand that that's the line. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=575.0s)]
*  And maybe you even do believe, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=577.2800000000001s)]
*  maybe you believe that he crossed lines. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=579.6800000000001s)]
*  He was inappropriate. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=582.6800000000001s)]
*  You don't like him, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=584.0s)]
*  but that's a big, big, big cry away from far cry from, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=585.48s)]
*  he committed rape. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=589.6400000000001s)]
*  He committed sexual assault. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=591.6400000000001s)]
*  And it's either that or it's you had consensual partners [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  who maybe were uncomfortable, but didn't express it. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=599.8s)]
*  You had people who were there. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=602.8399999999999s)]
*  Maybe they did feel duress, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=604.28s)]
*  but without telling him until 20 years later, [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=606.0799999999999s)]
*  how was he to know? [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=609.8s)]
*  I mean, what makes it a crime [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=611.04s)]
*  is when you don't have the consent of the other woman. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=612.88s)]
*  Like one of the women, as I understand it, Arthur, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=615.0s)]
*  it's been a while, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=616.8s)]
*  but she's alleging that he performed [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=617.64s)]
*  like forcible oral sex on her. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=620.24s)]
*  And I think you could definitely fairly get into, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=623.4399999999999s)]
*  how does that happen? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=628.08s)]
*  How can that be done in a forcible, non-consensual way, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=630.32s)]
*  or is it more likely it happened [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=636.24s)]
*  where the man thought he did have permission [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=637.5600000000001s)]
*  and learned later that the woman was there against her will? [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=640.84s)]
*  The state's gonna get into that. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=644.5600000000001s)]
*  That's what the prosecution has to do. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=645.76s)]
*  And they will, and then they're gonna drop it in Arthur's lap [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=647.76s)]
*  when they're done in graphic detail, [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=650.0s)]
*  leaving you with an image of how that could have happened. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=652.08s)]
*  Because it can happen. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=655.0s)]
*  I'm getting some free legal advice here. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=655.84s)]
*  How about this one, Megan? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=657.4s)]
*  Because I really think this is probably accurate. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=658.48s)]
*  They were kind of friends with benefits. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=662.6s)]
*  He was getting something from them [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=665.1999999999999s)]
*  and they were going to Oscar parties [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=666.64s)]
*  and they were going to the Cannes Film Festival [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=668.3199999999999s)]
*  and they were having access to things [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=670.88s)]
*  that they would never have access to. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=673.4s)]
*  These were not these caliber of people. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=675.24s)]
*  And in return, he had a nice 15 minutes [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=677.8s)]
*  in the bedroom with them. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=682.04s)]
*  Do any of them expressly allege that they said no [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=684.24s)]
*  in the moment and that they made clear [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=687.28s)]
*  with their body language or their voice explicitly [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=688.88s)]
*  that it was a no? [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=691.92s)]
*  Well, they do now. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=694.0s)]
*  In the grand jury, six years ago, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=695.8s)]
*  they were a lot more, it was a lot more hesitant. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=699.24s)]
*  And now six years later, it's much more, [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=702.56s)]
*  oh, absolutely, it was absolutely clear [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=705.24s)]
*  that that's not what I wanted. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=707.6s)]
*  So you know how testimony develops over the course of time. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=708.76s)]
*  All right, when he gives his closing argument, Mark, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=713.6s)]
*  come up here and you and I can go together. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=715.4s)]
*  Nice, love it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=717.92s)]
*  This case, honestly, this case is actually more [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=719.48s)]
*  about the opening argument. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=721.9599999999999s)]
*  I truly believe that. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=723.0799999999999s)]
*  I think you need to set the jurors mindset [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=724.52s)]
*  from the beginning, what they should be listening for, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=727.92s)]
*  where the holes in the people's cases, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=730.8399999999999s)]
*  where the evidence that they're not gonna hear, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=732.92s)]
*  they're not gonna hear from any law enforcement [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=735.68s)]
*  that things were admitted to, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=737.3199999999999s)]
*  not from any medical doctors, that anyone for treatment, [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=739.0799999999999s)]
*  not from any psychologists or psychiatrists. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=741.8399999999999s)]
*  There's no DNA, there's no video, there's no audio. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=744.28s)]
*  It's just them. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=747.3199999999999s)]
*  And you have to just judge their credibility, [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=748.88s)]
*  judge their body language, understand, [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=751.16s)]
*  listen to all the inconsistencies [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=753.04s)]
*  that are gonna come out, and then you tell me [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=754.64s)]
*  whether there's a reasonable doubt. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=756.56s)]
*  Arthur, I agree with you. [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=758.1999999999999s)]
*  I think it starts in jury selection. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=759.16s)]
*  You go right up to the line of pre-trying your case, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=760.7199999999999s)]
*  take one step back, and that's where you need to be [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=763.68s)]
*  to make sure you get the right jurors. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=766.3199999999999s)]
*  This is kind of exciting. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=769.04s)]
*  Now I'm kind of looking forward to it. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=770.0s)]
*  I hadn't been before. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=771.72s)]
*  I'm definitely gonna swing by. [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=772.6s)]
*  I hope I do get to see your opening. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=773.5600000000001s)]
*  I'm incredibly excited. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=775.04s)]
*  I got all the free advice, thank you. [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=775.88s)]
*  I got free advice from two greats. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=777.64s)]
*  I'm excited. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=779.16s)]
*  All right, so moving on to cases on our docket. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=781.12s)]
*  I wanna kick it off with this case down in Texas. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=784.24s)]
*  It's so disturbing. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=786.72s)]
*  These two kids, these two high school kids, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=789.12s)]
*  like this didn't need to happen. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=791.28s)]
*  The 17-year-old assailant, Carmelo Anthony, [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=794.44s)]
*  is arrested and charged with murder [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=797.6s)]
*  over the stabbing death of 17-year-old Austin Metcalf. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=799.44s)]
*  It happened on April 2nd. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=802.9200000000001s)]
*  Austin and his twin brother and this Carmelo Anthony, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=804.6400000000001s)]
*  who belonged to a different school, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=808.6800000000001s)]
*  were all at a track meet as spectators. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=810.5200000000001s)]
*  And I don't totally understand, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=813.4000000000001s)]
*  because I've heard different versions of this, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=816.0400000000001s)]
*  but it appears that at the track meets, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=817.44s)]
*  they would set up these tarps, [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=819.44s)]
*  and then various kids would hang out under the tarps. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=821.24s)]
*  And Austin and his twin brother [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=824.9200000000001s)]
*  and a group from their school were under one tarp. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=827.56s)]
*  There were many tarps. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=829.9599999999999s)]
*  And Carmelo Anthony, who was from a different school [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=831.1999999999999s)]
*  and definitely not part of their posse, [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=834.16s)]
*  came under the tarp and appears to have sat in Austin's seat. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=837.16s)]
*  Again, the allegations on exactly where he was [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=842.68s)]
*  and what the offense was, [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=845.4799999999999s)]
*  it's remained somewhat fuzzy to me, [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  but it was definitely under a tarp at a track meet. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=849.1199999999999s)]
*  And the allegation is that Austin went over to Carmelo. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=852.8399999999999s)]
*  This is from the police report, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=858.7199999999999s)]
*  that Austin went over and Austin told Anthony [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=860.16s)]
*  that he needed to move out from under their team's tent. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=865.68s)]
*  And Anthony grabbed his bag, again, quoting here, [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=869.9599999999999s)]
*  this is a full description, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=873.28s)]
*  Officer Taylor Wetzel wrote this, [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=874.64s)]
*  based on what a witness told him. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=878.04s)]
*  Then Carmelo Anthony grabbed his bag [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=879.4s)]
*  after being told he had to move [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=881.32s)]
*  and reached inside of it and proceeded to tell Austin, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=882.84s)]
*  touch me and see what happens. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=885.88s)]
*  No one really thought Anthony really had a weapon [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=888.08s)]
*  in his bag and Austin proceeded to touch Anthony. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=890.2s)]
*  And then Anthony told Austin to punch him [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=893.72s)]
*  and see what happens. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=897.24s)]
*  A short time later, [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=898.6400000000001s)]
*  Austin grabbed Anthony to tell him to move [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=900.0s)]
*  and Anthony pulled out what was recalled as a black knife [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=903.08s)]
*  and stabbed Austin once in the chest [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=908.32s)]
*  and then ran away. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=911.04s)]
*  Another officer spoke to two witnesses, [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=912.12s)]
*  one being the victim's twin brother, Hunter Metcalf. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=913.84s)]
*  They were hysterical. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=917.76s)]
*  So what we're hearing from Carmelo Anthony's defense lawyer [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=918.68s)]
*  is that they're gonna argue this was self-defense. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=923.8s)]
*  That, you know, he said, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=926.44s)]
*  touch me and find out what happens [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=929.84s)]
*  and then Austin touched him [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=931.24s)]
*  and therefore he was in fear and pulled out a knife. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=933.56s)]
*  I mean, you could argue self-defense [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=937.92s)]
*  if he had pulled out his fists [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=939.92s)]
*  and started punching Austin Metcalf. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=942.04s)]
*  We wouldn't be here. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=944.5999999999999s)]
*  The law would not be involved. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=945.5999999999999s)]
*  But Mark, he pulled out a knife and stabbed him in the chest. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=947.76s)]
*  And you tell me, but the self-defense laws in Texas [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=951.0799999999999s)]
*  and in all states require proportionality. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=954.92s)]
*  Of course. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=959.8s)]
*  And when I said, of course that's a defense, [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=960.64s)]
*  it's because you're not gonna argue insanity [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=962.64s)]
*  and you're not gonna argue it was someone else who did it. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=964.52s)]
*  It's clearly gonna be self-defense. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=968.0799999999999s)]
*  And the question is, do the facts rise to the level [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=970.04s)]
*  where he reasonably feared [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=972.76s)]
*  death or great bodily harm from this guy? [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=975.24s)]
*  And that hinges upon really what are the witnesses saying? [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=977.68s)]
*  You know, we don't have all the statements. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=981.36s)]
*  Maybe there's a few who say that the alleged, [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=983.56s)]
*  that the victim did grab him [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=986.7199999999999s)]
*  because I did read that that occurred. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=989.4s)]
*  I've heard touching, I've heard grabbing. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=990.8399999999999s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=993.12s)]
*  But if it was just like you read, [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=993.9599999999999s)]
*  I think that that falls short [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=995.88s)]
*  of reasonably believing death or great bodily harm. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=997.52s)]
*  And here's the other thing. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=999.96s)]
*  The other thing is he was the instigator. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1001.36s)]
*  He meaning the defendant. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1003.8000000000001s)]
*  That's a problem when you're the instigator [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1006.76s)]
*  where then you're the initial aggressor. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1008.84s)]
*  I think you might lose some protections. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1011.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah, you can't claim self-defense. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1013.48s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1015.08s)]
*  If you started it and the other guy is like, okay, let's go. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1015.9200000000001s)]
*  Then you can't say I had to do it to protect myself. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1021.0400000000001s)]
*  Here is Tim Poole. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1023.92s)]
*  He's a podcaster, Arthur. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1025.44s)]
*  He was on his show talking about this. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1026.92s)]
*  And I'd love to get your reaction to what he says here. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1028.96s)]
*  Watch. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1031.88s)]
*  Imagine you are invited to a party [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1032.72s)]
*  at someone else's house [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1034.68s)]
*  and you are legally carrying a firearm. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1035.88s)]
*  And then a fight breaks out and you, [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1038.24s)]
*  or an altercation breaks out between you and some guy [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1041.0s)]
*  and you know, there's drinking involved or whatever. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1043.64s)]
*  I'm not trying to make a one for one scenario. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1045.44s)]
*  I'm trying to create a potential scenario [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1047.12s)]
*  separate from this one with similarities. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1049.04s)]
*  You go to a party. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1051.36s)]
*  Yeah, let's say you go to a party. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1052.3600000000001s)]
*  And some guy starts saying stuff like, yo man, get out. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1054.24s)]
*  And you're like, I can do what I want. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1056.68s)]
*  I was invited to the party. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1057.96s)]
*  Verbal altercation escalates. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1059.44s)]
*  And then the dude, you're standing there [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1062.28s)]
*  and you pull your sweater back and you've got a gun. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1064.3600000000001s)]
*  You put your hand up and say, don't come any, [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1066.56s)]
*  don't come close to me, bro. [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1068.4s)]
*  I'm warning you right now. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1069.6200000000001s)]
*  Do not come close. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1070.88s)]
*  Do not take another step. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1071.82s)]
*  Then the guy grabs your arm and makes a move. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1073.2s)]
*  So you draw your weapon and you use it. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1075.72s)]
*  Okay, make the argument you have no right [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1079.4s)]
*  to defend yourself when you're being attacked by a guy. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1081.08s)]
*  Make the argument by all means, go ahead and do so. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1083.4399999999998s)]
*  I ain't gonna do it. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1084.9199999999998s)]
*  That's a ground ball. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1086.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean, that's a law school where you can't. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1088.84s)]
*  So sorry, you have to get punched in the face. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1091.8s)]
*  You're not allowed to execute someone with a gun [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1094.6399999999999s)]
*  who's gonna punch you in the nose. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1097.96s)]
*  And just the way the law is, I believe in all 50 states, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1099.52s)]
*  you just said it, Megan, it's a proportionality. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1102.1399999999999s)]
*  Let me just tell you how this case is gonna get handled [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1106.48s)]
*  in Texas with this 17 year old. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1108.56s)]
*  Oh, it should get, and this is the reality [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1110.9199999999998s)]
*  and Mark will back me up. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1112.94s)]
*  Oh, Guy Glash is gonna get hired. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1115.2s)]
*  He's gonna get some kind of a child psychologist, [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1116.6399999999999s)]
*  a child psychiatrist. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1119.56s)]
*  They're gonna do a whole buildup of this kid, [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1121.6399999999999s)]
*  who he is, where he's from, the defendant I'm talking about, [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1124.08s)]
*  who he is, where he's from, what his background is, [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1126.32s)]
*  any kind of mitigation whatsoever. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1129.32s)]
*  And then you're gonna go in and you're gonna sit down [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1131.8s)]
*  with one of the lead prosecutors of the Homicide Bureau [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1133.8s)]
*  in that jurisdiction and you're gonna be like, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1136.96s)]
*  look, you and I know that based on the witnesses, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1140.44s)]
*  based on the evidence that we have, [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1143.72s)]
*  yes, there's a possibility I could go in front of a jury [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1145.78s)]
*  with a straight face and say self-defense, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1148.04s)]
*  but that's too big of a risk for a 17 year old kid [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1150.28s)]
*  who might spend the rest of his life in jail. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1153.0s)]
*  We're not minimizing the loss of life [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1155.08s)]
*  of another 17 year old, but let's not try to have [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1156.72s)]
*  two absolute complete tragedies. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1159.88s)]
*  And let's talk about a number, a real number, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1162.44s)]
*  where the kid's gonna spend a lot of time in jail, [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1165.12s)]
*  but not the rest of his life in jail, [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1167.28s)]
*  which would probably be the case if he goes to trial [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1168.72s)]
*  and loses and you sit down and two qualified lawyers, [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1171.76s)]
*  very experienced lawyers, with the approval of the judge [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1175.3999999999999s)]
*  work out some sort of plea bargain. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1178.6799999999998s)]
*  This is not, from what we know. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1180.08s)]
*  That makes perfect sense. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1181.3999999999999s)]
*  Not a trial. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1183.1599999999999s)]
*  But there's a lot behind these two sides right now. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1184.0s)]
*  People are lining up on both sides of this case. [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1187.96s)]
*  The GoFundMe's for each guy are almost exactly [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1190.98s)]
*  the same amount, let's call it 325,000, [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1195.3600000000001s)]
*  that people have donated to both. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1197.1200000000001s)]
*  Because people defending Carmelo Anthony [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1198.76s)]
*  think that this was self-defense [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1201.1200000000001s)]
*  and he's getting railroaded potentially because he's black. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1202.52s)]
*  And people on the Metcalf family side say, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1205.04s)]
*  this is outrageous. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1208.24s)]
*  At worst, if you take all the allegations [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1209.28s)]
*  about Austin Metcalf as true, [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1211.8s)]
*  at worst what he did was put his hands on a guy [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1215.24s)]
*  who refused to leave a section that he wasn't seated in [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1217.6000000000001s)]
*  and put his hands on him at the guy's invitation to say, [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1222.24s)]
*  try to make me. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1227.3600000000001s)]
*  And you don't get a knife in the heart for that. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1228.2s)]
*  I'll read you the law on self-defense in Texas. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1232.0s)]
*  A person is justified in using deadly force against another. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1236.56s)]
*  When into the degree the actor reasonably believes [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1240.4s)]
*  the deadly force is immediately necessary, [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1243.0800000000002s)]
*  A, to protect the actor against the other's use [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1246.5s)]
*  or attempted use of unlawful deadly force. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1250.4s)]
*  So it's not any kind of force or bodily harm. [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1255.52s)]
*  You have to reasonably think that you need [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1259.76s)]
*  to immediately use deadly force [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1263.0s)]
*  to prevent unlawful deadly force against you. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1266.3000000000002s)]
*  Or, and here, okay, let's say maybe Carmelo Anthony [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1269.76s)]
*  has something under the orb clause, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1273.0400000000002s)]
*  to prevent the other's imminent commission [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1275.5600000000002s)]
*  of aggravated kidnapping, murder, sexual assault, [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1279.2s)]
*  aggravated sexual assault, robbery, or aggravated robbery. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1283.44s)]
*  Not even aggravated assault is listed there. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1287.88s)]
*  There's nothing. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1291.92s)]
*  Yeah, no, Arthur was 100% correct, articulate, passionate [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1293.76s)]
*  in exactly assessing how this is going to go down [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1298.48s)]
*  if this is being handled reasonably. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1300.92s)]
*  Whether it's me representing him or someone else, [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1302.76s)]
*  you don't take the risk of going to trial with these facts [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1305.14s)]
*  assuming there's no additional facts we don't know about. [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1308.22s)]
*  Like did the kid say, I'm gonna kill you now, [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1311.02s)]
*  and then he stabs him. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1313.28s)]
*  And then again, I'm taking stuff up, I don't know. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1314.9s)]
*  You'll sit down with a prosecutor [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1317.6000000000001s)]
*  after you have your client evaluated. [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1319.54s)]
*  If the prosecutors aren't playing ball [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1321.68s)]
*  and giving you a reasonable outcome, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1323.38s)]
*  maybe you like the judge, [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1325.04s)]
*  the judge is compassionate and reasonable. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1326.3s)]
*  You look for some type of downward departure [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1327.98s)]
*  below what he would normally be getting, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1330.46s)]
*  and you look for some compassion from the judge. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1332.46s)]

*  And Megan, in terms of the GoFundMe stuff, [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1338.86s)]
*  the biggest joke about the GoFundMe stuff [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1339.9s)]
*  has got to do with that kid Luigi Mangione [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1342.7s)]
*  who executed the executive, [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1344.62s)]
*  and the women are sending him letters. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1347.82s)]
*  People are saying, oh, he's got a chance to trial. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1350.3799999999999s)]
*  People are into him, yeah. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1353.34s)]
*  Wait until those 12 jurors see the deceased wife [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1354.62s)]
*  on the witness stand who has to identify the body [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1357.74s)]
*  and talk about how her kids missed their father, [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1360.34s)]

*  Yeah, we're just not gonna get to, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1369.2s)]
*  and I just said we're not gonna get to the point [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1370.44s)]
*  in this country where what's foreseeable [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1371.96s)]
*  is a knife to the heart among 17-year-old boys [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1374.88s)]
*  who are scuffling, even arguing impolitely. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1378.52s)]
*  I don't know exactly what happened. [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1381.1000000000001s)]
*  We'll find out over a seat at a track meet. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1382.26s)]
*  Like, that's just, no one is going to interpret the law [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1384.76s)]
*  to say it was a reasonable response, [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1387.76s)]
*  because that's what self-defense is trying to factor in, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1390.2s)]
*  was your response reasonable under the circumstances? [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1392.2s)]
*  Texas has got the castle doctrine [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1395.4s)]

*  So this isn't that. [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1401.3600000000001s)]
*  This is not that. [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1403.0400000000002s)]
*  This kid got asked a question, [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1404.3200000000002s)]
*  please leave or told to leave, [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1407.68s)]

*  And Austin allegedly put hands on him, [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1412.3200000000002s)]
*  and he stabbed him through the heart. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1414.42s)]
*  In no world is that gonna qualify as self-defense. [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1415.6000000000001s)]
*  I'll let Andrew Branca, he's been on the show many times [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1419.76s)]
*  in connection with the Kyle Rittenhouse case. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1423.1000000000001s)]
*  He's got a whole blog called the Law of Self-Defense. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1426.0s)]
*  He's very pro Second Amendment. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1428.68s)]
*  He took a look at the police report. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1430.48s)]
*  Here's what he said, Sat 7. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1431.68s)]
*  Austin, the victim had told Anthony, the stabber, [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1433.24s)]
*  that he needed to move out from under the team's tent, [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1437.44s)]
*  and Anthony grabbed his bag, opened it, and reached inside, [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1440.28s)]
*  and proceeded to tell Austin, [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1444.16s)]
*  touch me and see what happens. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1446.24s)]
*  No one really thought Anthony really had any weapons [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1448.96s)]
*  in his bag, and Austin proceeded to touch Anthony, [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1451.44s)]
*  and then Anthony told Austin to punch him [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1454.52s)]
*  and see what happens. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1458.0s)]
*  This is provocation with intent, folks. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1460.16s)]
*  These are facts I had not heard before. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1463.0s)]
*  The stabber is provoking the victim [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1466.32s)]
*  to use force for the purpose of being able [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1471.32s)]
*  to inflict deadly force upon him. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1475.68s)]
*  That's the most severe form of provocation, [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1479.24s)]
*  provocation with intent, [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1482.18s)]
*  and loses you self-defense as a legal defense. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1483.02s)]
*  These are bad facts for Carmelo Anthony. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1486.8999999999999s)]
*  This is what you were saying, Mark, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1492.54s)]
*  because the second part of that statute that I read [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1493.62s)]
*  that speaks to deadly force in defense of person reads, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1497.3s)]
*  the actor's belief that you're about to face [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1500.62s)]
*  deadly bodily harm, deadly bodily harm, [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1503.34s)]
*  that the belief that the deadly force [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1507.26s)]
*  was immediately necessary as described above, [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1509.86s)]
*  is presumed to be reasonable if the actor [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1512.62s)]
*  did not provoke the person against whom the force was used. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1515.1s)]
*  So that provocation, he's saying make me, [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1520.6999999999998s)]
*  you know, make me, is provocation. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1523.6999999999998s)]
*  I'm gonna argue the other side of this, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1526.1399999999999s)]
*  because not legally, legally we've already done [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1527.4599999999998s)]
*  the analysis on it and it's solid, [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1532.1799999999998s)]
*  but you put people in the box in Texas, okay? [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1534.34s)]
*  We would think without knowing that, you know, [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1537.58s)]
*  there's $300,000 plus being donated to the Defendants Fund, [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1540.34s)]
*  that there couldn't be anyone supporting [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1545.1399999999999s)]
*  this type of activity, [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1547.06s)]
*  but that shows what we're talking about here. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1548.54s)]
*  You go to a jury trial, there may be a few people [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1552.22s)]
*  who just say, I don't care what the facts are, [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1555.74s)]
*  or those facts are enough for me, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1557.6599999999999s)]
*  he reasonably feared or else he wouldn't have stabbed him. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1559.02s)]
*  I'm telling you it's not a slam dunk jury trial [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1562.1s)]
*  because of who's gonna sit on this jury. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1565.18s)]
*  Well, not only that, but unfortunately, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1569.3400000000001s)]
*  the internet has done its thing, [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1571.98s)]
*  and they have tried to paint the victim here, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1573.6200000000001s)]
*  Austin Metcalf, as a white supremacist, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1576.3s)]
*  for which there is zero support. [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1581.0600000000002s)]
*  It's ridiculous, they're circulating pictures of Austin [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1583.54s)]
*  and his twin brother wearing camouflage and holding guns, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1586.6200000000001s)]
*  like going out hunting, juxtaposed with Anthony in a suit, [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1589.8200000000002s)]
*  and this very popular guy on X calls him [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1594.58s)]
*  a suspected white supremacist. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1600.1799999999998s)]
*  A suspected white supremacist? [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1602.46s)]
*  No, I mean, honestly, you could get sued for this, sir. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1604.1s)]
*  Like you seriously could get sued. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1607.5s)]
*  And by the way, there are lots of pictures [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1608.6999999999998s)]
*  of Carmelo Anthony holding a gun [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1611.54s)]
*  and holding up the middle finger [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1613.86s)]
*  and trying to look like a thug on the internet too. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1615.62s)]
*  But this is what the prosecutor's gonna have to deal with too [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1618.98s)]
*  when he's trying to pick a jury, right? [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1622.94s)]
*  Have you seen these posts suggesting that the decedent [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1625.7s)]
*  is some sort of a white supremacist? [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1629.18s)]
*  It's a lie, but it's out there. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1630.98s)]
*  But you can't say that, you don't wanna put it out there, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1632.8200000000002s)]
*  so you have to be more delicate as a prosecutor. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1635.18s)]
*  What have you seen? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1637.06s)]
*  Let's go sidebar to discuss it so that doesn't come out. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1638.42s)]
*  The minute they hear that he might be a white supremacist, [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1642.3400000000001s)]
*  now you've infected the jury. [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1644.6200000000001s)]
*  Painted your own jury pool, yeah. [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1646.78s)]
*  And by the way, I mean, just for the record, [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1648.66s)]
*  even if you were a white supremacist, [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1650.5800000000002s)]
*  again, zero, zero, zero evidence to that effect, [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1651.98s)]
*  that you still can't stick a knife in his heart. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1655.38s)]
*  You still can't. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1657.14s)]
*  You have to have you. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1658.98s)]
*  And it would actually, it would be irrelevant. [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1659.82s)]
*  It wouldn't come out, it's not relevant to the case. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1661.6200000000001s)]
*  I mean, unless someone said he threw out a racial slur [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1664.3s)]
*  or something like that, that would be different. [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1667.22s)]
*  But I would argue as a defense attorney, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1669.42s)]
*  how is that relevant if he's Catholic, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1672.06s)]
*  if he's Jewish, if he's a white supremacist, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1673.78s)]
*  or if he's part of Black Lives Matter? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1676.06s)]
*  It doesn't matter, that's not part of this case. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1677.82s)]
*  Unless, unless. I love you throw white supremacists [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1680.5400000000002s)]
*  on the list of being Catholic or Jewish, what? [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1682.1000000000001s)]
*  Well, I mean, none of that stuff comes in in a trial. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1685.22s)]
*  No, I know, but I'm just saying, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1687.9s)]
*  it's not like an acceptable religious choice [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1689.2600000000002s)]
*  right after Catholicism and Judaism. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1691.7800000000002s)]
*  Okay, Maggie, give me a break. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1694.5400000000002s)]
*  I'm over here, I'm in trial prep, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1695.74s)]
*  I'm doing the best I can under the circumstance. [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1697.22s)]
*  I'm very defensive of my Catholic faith right now, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1699.5400000000002s)]
*  because my kids are about to be confirmed. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1701.8600000000001s)]
*  So I've been going to the retreats, [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1703.2600000000002s)]
*  my most holy, except for my legs. [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1705.18s)]
*  Well, if you notice, if you notice, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1707.3000000000002s)]
*  I gloss his outfits, he's got the pink and the purple. [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1708.5s)]
*  I mean, he is ready to walk out in the Easter parade [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1711.9s)]
*  here in Fifth Avenue. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1714.1000000000001s)]
*  He's our own little bunny. [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1716.98s)]
*  I'm glad that I don't celebrate Easter. [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1719.66s)]
*  The price of eggs are too high, record high. [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1721.3s)]
*  We just did a fact check on that, [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1724.38s)]
*  on the AM update on egg prices, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1726.06s)]
*  for those of you interested. [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1727.74s)]
*  Okay, let's move on. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1729.14s)]
*  So Brian Kohlberger, this trial's gonna go down in August. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1730.3400000000001s)]
*  It's happening for real. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1735.06s)]
*  And you've got Judge Hipler, hip, hip, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1736.62s)]
*  with a P, double P, Ler. [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1743.06s)]
*  It's so close, who is the new judge. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1746.1799999999998s)]
*  And the defense attorney, Ann Taylor, [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1749.06s)]
*  yes, that's her name, is now maneuvering [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1751.8999999999999s)]
*  to suggest a trial that there were two assailants [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1755.2199999999998s)]
*  who killed these four Idaho college students [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1760.58s)]
*  within the course of what we believe is 12 to 17 minutes, [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1763.98s)]
*  22 at the outside, but more like 12 minutes, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1769.06s)]
*  that two men went into that Idaho house that night [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1773.22s)]
*  and killed Kaylee Gonzalves and Maddie Mogan [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1777.54s)]
*  and Ethan Chapin and Zana Kernodle, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1781.18s)]
*  not Brian Kohlberger, who was a student [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1784.1s)]
*  at University of Washington and a TA, [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1786.8600000000001s)]
*  getting his PhD in criminology. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1789.78s)]
*  Here's a little bit of Ann Taylor talking about [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1793.66s)]
*  the expert witness she's gonna put on to that effect [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1796.74s)]
*  or wants to put on. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1799.66s)]
*  Didn't you produce an expert who said [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1802.02s)]
*  that it would have required two people to commit the crime? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1803.78s)]
*  Your Honor, we have produced an expert [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1811.42s)]
*  that believes that it's likely that there were two people, [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1814.22s)]
*  two weapons. [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1819.34s)]
*  And she goes on to say, we came across a tip [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1822.82s)]
*  that would appear to be an alternate suspect. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1825.66s)]
*  We're trying to work through that as rapidly as we can. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1830.3s)]
*  And Judge Hipler said he would set a May deadline [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1833.18s)]
*  for the defense to present evidence of an alternate suspect. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1836.06s)]
*  So why are they doing that? [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1839.1399999999999s)]
*  Why is she showing them? [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1840.22s)]
*  I'm on a Michael Connolly terror right now, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1841.86s)]
*  reading all of his legal thrillers. [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1843.66s)]
*  The defense, aren't they supposed to surprise the prosecution [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1845.74s)]
*  with something like this? [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1848.78s)]
*  You have to disclose every card [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1850.3799999999999s)]
*  you're gonna play at trial? [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1852.08s)]
*  Sometimes you do, Maggie. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1854.32s)]
*  I mean, something like it, like when it comes to experts, [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1855.6799999999998s)]
*  especially when it comes to experts, you have to, [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1857.8s)]
*  there's a, in New York, there's a very strict requirement [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1859.8s)]
*  because you play the game of the experts. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1863.56s)]
*  You gotta let them know who your expert is [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1865.6799999999998s)]
*  and give them an offer of proof, basically, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1867.34s)]
*  about what they're gonna testify. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1869.76s)]
*  And then they get to go get their own expert [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1871.6399999999999s)]
*  to contradict what your expert is saying. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1873.84s)]
*  I mean, it usually doesn't hold true [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1876.6s)]
*  for private investigators, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1878.36s)]
*  but if you're introducing a whole new theory to the case, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1880.6s)]
*  you may not be obligated under the law to do that, [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1884.36s)]
*  but a judge usually doesn't like to get caught by surprise. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1888.04s)]
*  So I don't know if that particular jurisdiction, [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1891.6399999999999s)]
*  I can tell you for an alibi witness, [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1894.52s)]
*  if you're gonna, if you're in New York, [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1896.6s)]
*  if you're saying my guy wasn't at the scene, [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1898.3999999999999s)]
*  he was in Rhode Island at the time that it took place. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1900.8s)]
*  Which he is. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1903.9199999999998s)]
*  There's a certain amount of time, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1904.76s)]
*  there's a certain amount of time where you have to say, [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1906.1599999999999s)]
*  my client was not there and they were elsewhere. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1909.72s)]
*  She alleged he was out stargazing that night. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1912.28s)]
*  It was just a lovely night for stargazing [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1915.24s)]
*  and that was their quote alibi. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1917.28s)]
*  Here's the other point in this case, Mark. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1918.88s)]
*  The defense moved to bar the prosecution [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1922.0s)]
*  from using the terms psychopath and sociopath [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1925.8s)]
*  before the jurors. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1929.9s)]
*  They actually also didn't want the prosecution [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1932.1200000000001s)]
*  to use the term murderer. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1934.8600000000001s)]
*  The judge left open the possibility [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1938.08s)]
*  that the prosecution could use the word murderer [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1940.32s)]
*  during closing arguments, [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1943.6s)]
*  but I think is still considering on psychopath or sociopath. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1946.22s)]
*  But what kind of motion is this? [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1950.1599999999999s)]
*  Since when can the prosecution not say, he's a murderer? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1952.3999999999999s)]
*  That's what we're all doing here. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1955.72s)]
*  Okay, so this is, you have to imagine [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1958.24s)]
*  he's gonna be convicted and then there's going to be [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1961.1599999999999s)]
*  always an attack on what the lawyers [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1963.8799999999999s)]
*  could have or should have done. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1966.28s)]
*  And also the lawyers want to win. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1968.3600000000001s)]
*  So there's no harm and don't take offense [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1969.3600000000001s)]
*  with lawyers filing motions and for the judge to consider it. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1971.1000000000001s)]
*  Calling him a murderer, I would argue, is unfair [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1975.38s)]
*  until and unless closing argument occurs [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1978.88s)]
*  when they then have proven that he did commit murder. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1981.48s)]
*  That's number one. [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1984.8600000000001s)]
*  The other thing, sociopath, psychopath, [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1985.92s)]
*  any words they want to come up with, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1988.16s)]
*  if that's not proven, if that hasn't ever been proven [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1989.54s)]
*  as a fact, it would be unfair, one would argue. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1993.3600000000001s)]
*  Jures would think that if those terms apply to him, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1996.8s)]
*  it's more likely that he is a murderer. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=1999.68s)]
*  So I know why the defense would not want those things heard. [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2001.48s)]
*  And if there's not evidence to support it, [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2004.36s)]
*  the judge shouldn't let it in. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2005.8s)]
*  It's just prejudices. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2007.48s)]
*  Arthur, of the movie, Jagged Edge. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2008.32s)]
*  It was one of the greatest legal thrillers ever. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2010.1599999999999s)]
*  You guys remember that movie? [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2013.28s)]
*  So good, if the audience hasn't seen it. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2014.12s)]
*  With Glenn Close, right. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2016.44s)]
*  And Jeff Bridges, so good. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2017.84s)]
*  And in the closing argument, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2020.2s)]
*  and I won't get into exactly all of it, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2022.9199999999998s)]
*  but in the closing argument, there's that great lawyer [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2025.96s)]
*  and he said something to the effect of, [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2028.8400000000001s)]
*  he's a sociopath, he is an ice man. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2031.68s)]
*  And I was like, oh, right? [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2036.1200000000001s)]
*  So like, I think that's how it went down. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2037.68s)]
*  He might've been saying it out of court. [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2039.28s)]
*  But my point is simply, [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2040.32s)]
*  prosecutors make these arguments. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2042.1200000000001s)]
*  I would be happy and fine as a prosecutor. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2044.76s)]
*  Arthur's saying, he's a sociopath. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2047.92s)]
*  He went into that house and took the lives of four. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2049.88s)]
*  Why couldn't you argue that? [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2052.14s)]
*  Well, first of all, the judge has ruled in this case [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2054.8s)]
*  that it will give them leeway in their closing arguments. [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2057.6000000000004s)]
*  But that's prejudicial and conclusory statements [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2060.7200000000003s)]
*  by the prosecutor. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2064.32s)]
*  It's the jury's job to determine whether he's a murderer. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2065.6000000000004s)]
*  Like in the Harvey Weinstein case, [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2069.5s)]
*  I'm objecting to them calling these. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2071.0800000000004s)]
*  You lost touch with your prosecutor rules. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2072.92s)]
*  Both of you people. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2075.0s)]
*  Say, he can't hide it. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2077.1600000000003s)]
*  You gotta be able to, I totally disagree. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2079.92s)]
*  You can argue the same. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2082.5800000000004s)]
*  You can say, he is a sociopath. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2085.48s)]
*  He has no feelings about taking the lives of others. [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2086.72s)]
*  Megan, you can't. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2090.16s)]
*  Hold on, hold on. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2091.0s)]
*  You can't go back me up. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2091.8399999999997s)]
*  You can't go back me up. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2092.68s)]
*  The judge ruled properly here. [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2093.52s)]
*  Prosecutor should not call a defendant a sociopath. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2095.12s)]
*  That's almost reversible error. [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2098.7999999999997s)]
*  You can't have me testify. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2100.3599999999997s)]
*  Megan, Megan, because it's not an opinion. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2102.44s)]
*  You are, to be a sociopath or a psychopath, [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2105.4s)]
*  there has to be proof, meaning someone analyzed him. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2109.8399999999997s)]
*  That wasn't done. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2113.3199999999997s)]
*  That's such a prejudicial term. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2115.4s)]
*  I really disagree. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2116.64s)]
*  I think if you can prove that this guy took the lives [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2117.48s)]
*  of four college students in 12 minutes, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2120.36s)]
*  single-handedly with a serrated edge knife, [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2122.2s)]
*  and then walked out and went home [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2125.52s)]
*  and took a selfie of himself [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2127.48s)]
*  with his little white shirt on and a thumbs up, [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2129.0s)]
*  it's fair to say he's a murderer. [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2131.72s)]
*  He's a sociopath. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2134.52s)]
*  Don't let him walk the streets. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2136.48s)]
*  Murderer, yes, in closing, once it's been proven [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2139.08s)]
*  that he has no feelings, [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2141.88s)]
*  that he, all the things that you said, [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2143.76s)]
*  except for that term, which there's been no evidence, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2145.6800000000003s)]
*  it's conclusory, there's no expert testimony of that. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2149.36s)]
*  A couple of bleeding hearts here. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2152.76s)]
*  The same thing. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2153.6000000000004s)]
*  No, it's not long, it's the long, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2154.44s)]
*  I forget if, I was a prosecutor for five years. [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2156.2000000000003s)]
*  I know, it's been too long. [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2159.32s)]
*  I was a prosecutor. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2160.6400000000003s)]
*  You went too native on the defense attorney years. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2161.48s)]
*  Okay, let's move on. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2165.04s)]
*  I actually don't know. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2165.88s)]
*  You wanna try the case twice? [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2166.7200000000003s)]
*  No, you're probably right, but I think it's stupid. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2167.56s)]
*  We'll try it twice, we'll do it your way, [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2169.6400000000003s)]
*  and then the next time, when they reverse it, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2171.44s)]
*  we'll come back and do it our way. [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2172.96s)]
*  We definitely don't want that. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2173.8s)]
*  Okay, now this might be my favorite one of the day. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2175.12s)]
*  The Blake Lively story. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2178.76s)]
*  This is so interesting to me. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2180.96s)]
*  So as the audience knows, there's this death match [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2182.6s)]
*  going on between Blake Lively and Justin Baldoni, [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2187.88s)]
*  with whom she made the movie, [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2191.16s)]
*  It Ends With Us, a film about domestic abuse. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2192.32s)]
*  She tried to claim that he sexually harassed her on set. [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2195.04s)]
*  He hired my lawyer, Brian Friedman, [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2197.96s)]
*  from my dispute with NBC, and fought back fiercely, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2202.76s)]
*  saying I never harassed her a single day. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2208.36s)]
*  She's a psychopath, and she's made this stuff up. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2212.2400000000002s)]
*  She's making this stuff up because she wanted [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2216.32s)]
*  to wrest control of the movie away from me, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2218.36s)]
*  and I let her, to a large extent, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2220.7200000000003s)]
*  but not to the extent she wanted. [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2223.84s)]
*  And ultimately, she did get control of the movie, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2225.32s)]
*  and then tried to ruin my life. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2228.2799999999997s)]
*  So that's kind of where it is. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2229.8399999999997s)]
*  Cross suits. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2231.7599999999998s)]
*  He sued the New York Times for defamation, too, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2233.48s)]
*  because they wrote a very sympathetic article about her [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2235.56s)]
*  and what a victim she is. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2238.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, one of her allegations was that, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2239.68s)]
*  well, let me show you the scene. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2243.24s)]
*  We cut it. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2244.2s)]
*  Part of it. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2246.2799999999997s)]
*  It's where her character gives birth in the movie. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2247.1s)]
*  It Ends With Us. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2249.12s)]
*  Now let's just watch it first. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2249.96s)]
*  ["It Ends With Us"] [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2251.48s)]
*  Listing audience. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2255.04s)]
*  You can see her belly. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2256.2s)]
*  She's got the legs spread. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2257.96s)]
*  He comes in. [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2259.2000000000003s)]
*  He's holding her hand. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2260.0400000000004s)]
*  She's acting like a pregnant lady delivering a baby. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2261.5600000000004s)]
*  Except she's smiling, which isn't realistic. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2265.32s)]
*  I was gonna say, she's pretty happy. [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2268.5600000000004s)]
*  He's touching her hand. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2271.2400000000002s)]
*  That's not how my wife acted. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2273.48s)]
*  I was gonna say, Marianne did not look that way, Megan. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2274.7200000000003s)]
*  Marianne did not look that way. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2276.96s)]
*  It was my fault. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2278.7200000000003s)]
*  I was getting hit. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2279.6400000000003s)]
*  I was called stupid. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2281.5600000000004s)]
*  I was called a very stupid man. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2282.6400000000003s)]
*  But then I got to perform surgery [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2285.56s)]
*  by cutting the umbilical cord. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2287.9599999999996s)]
*  I've never gotten to med school. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2290.3999999999996s)]
*  Oh, there we go. [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2291.8799999999997s)]
*  He's cutting the umbilical cord. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2292.72s)]
*  Okay, but for about two seconds, there's a doctor down. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2294.04s)]
*  What comedian was it? [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2298.3599999999997s)]
*  Johnny Bench. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2299.24s)]
*  Like Johnny Bench in between the legs [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2300.08s)]
*  getting ready to catch the baby. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2301.7999999999997s)]
*  Was it Bill Cosby? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2303.7999999999997s)]
*  Who was it who did that bit? [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2304.8399999999997s)]
*  Anyway, so her complaint alleges [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2306.4399999999996s)]
*  that that was one of the moments in which she got harassed [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2312.0s)]
*  because she says she was, here, I'll read you [[00:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2315.2400000000002s)]
*  from the lawsuit. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2319.52s)]
*  On the day of shooting that scene, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2320.8s)]
*  Mr. Baldoni and his business partner, Mr. Heath, [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2323.2000000000003s)]
*  suddenly pressured Ms. Lively to simulate full nudity, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2325.04s)]
*  despite no mention of nudity for this scene in the script [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2328.36s)]
*  in her contract or previous discussions. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2331.04s)]
*  Claimed that Baldoni insisted [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2333.16s)]
*  that women do give birth naked. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2334.76s)]
*  I mean, do they? [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2337.44s)]
*  Other than like a water birth? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2338.92s)]
*  Like what woman is like, yeah, take it off. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2340.2s)]
*  Take it all off. [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2342.3999999999996s)]
*  No, that's all that happens in there. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2344.0s)]
*  You got your gown and the gown, they hike it up, [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2345.92s)]
*  but you got a little something on. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2348.12s)]
*  Okay, anyway, he insisted that women give birth naked, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2349.7999999999997s)]
*  to which she disagreed, but felt forced into a compromise [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2353.3999999999996s)]
*  that she would be naked from below the chest. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2357.2799999999997s)]
*  When the birth scene was filmed, the set was chaotic, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2360.52s)]
*  crowded, she says, and utterly lacking [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2362.8799999999997s)]
*  in standard industry protections for filming nude scenes. [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2364.92s)]
*  Baldoni failed to close the set, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2368.88s)]
*  allowing non-essential crew to pass through, [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2371.68s)]
*  while Ms. Lively was partially nude from below the chest [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2373.4s)]
*  down with her legs spread, spread wide in stirrups, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2376.16s)]
*  and only a small piece of fabric covering her genitalia. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2379.88s)]
*  Ms. Lively was not provided with anything [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2383.92s)]
*  with which to cover herself between takes [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2386.36s)]
*  until after she had made multiple requests. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2388.24s)]
*  She became even more alarmed when Baldoni introduced [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2390.7599999999998s)]
*  his, quote, best friend to play the role of the OBGYN. [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2393.2s)]
*  Claimed typically, a small role of this nature [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2396.44s)]
*  would be filled by a local actor. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2399.2000000000003s)]
*  She felt the selection of Baldoni's friend [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2401.7200000000003s)]
*  for this intimate role, in which the actor's face [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2403.6s)]
*  and hands were in close proximity [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2406.1600000000003s)]
*  to her nearly nude genitals for a birth scene [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2408.12s)]
*  was invasive and humiliating. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2410.2000000000003s)]
*  However, guys, as you know, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2412.64s)]
*  because you prepared for today, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2414.08s)]
*  that actor, Adam Monshine, has now spoken out [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2416.44s)]
*  and he's got a bone to pick [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2422.44s)]
*  with Blake Lively's description of what happened on that set. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2424.68s)]
*  Arthur, you wanna take it from there? [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2428.24s)]
*  Well, first of all, the actor, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2430.7599999999998s)]
*  he's the one who's like the very, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2432.48s)]
*  the Shakespearean trained actor. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2434.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, basically he says that's not what happened [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2436.68s)]
*  and it was very professional, [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2438.6s)]
*  the scene was very professional, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2439.9199999999996s)]
*  and like nothing was untoward, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2441.8399999999997s)]
*  and it was, it was all a big nothing burger, [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2444.8799999999997s)]
*  and they're making this shit. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2447.2799999999997s)]
*  And she was clothed. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2448.12s)]
*  He says she was wearing clothing. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2449.7599999999998s)]
*  He said she, her costume included a full hospital gown, [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2452.12s)]
*  black shorts, and torso covering prosthetic [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2456.72s)]
*  to make her appear pregnant, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2459.0s)]
*  in addition to whatever personal garments she chose. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2460.0s)]
*  Yeah, so it's not too good when you have a guy [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2464.0s)]
*  who was there saying this is not the truth. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2466.68s)]
*  And he's, I think a big point though, [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2469.96s)]
*  he's a legitimate actor. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2471.7599999999998s)]
*  The, watch, he gets his name with a, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2473.56s)]
*  it gets with an M, who's saying it. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2475.08s)]
*  It's like he's a legitimate guy. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2477.04s)]
*  So who doesn't seem to have a horse. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2478.7599999999998s)]
*  She is making it sound like, you know, [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2480.96s)]
*  Arthur was the director of this scene [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2484.08s)]
*  and he got his buddy Lawrence Taylor to come by [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2485.96s)]
*  to play the OBGYN. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2488.12s)]
*  Blake Levy is gonna be naked. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2489.64s)]
*  Get in here LT. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2491.44s)]
*  This is not what happened. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2492.7200000000003s)]
*  This guy. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2494.64s)]
*  This guy has his bachelor's of fine arts in acting [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2497.0s)]
*  from the University of Maryland. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2500.08s)]
*  He's got an MFA, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2501.52s)]
*  master's of fine arts in acting from UCLA. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2502.6s)]
*  He worked for several Shakespeare companies, [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2505.12s)]
*  toured nationally with the Tony award winning acting company, [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2507.64s)]
*  attended the British American Dramatic Academy's [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2510.56s)]
*  midsummer in Oxford program as a full scholarship winner. [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2512.64s)]
*  He's been on numerous shows on Netflix, on ABC, on TNT. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2515.84s)]
*  Once again, Mark, the problem is her allegations [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2520.16s)]
*  in her complaint do not seem to match up [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2522.68s)]
*  with not just what Justin's saying, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2525.24s)]
*  but with what independent people who have no acts to grind [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2527.2799999999997s)]
*  with Blake Lively are saying. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2530.7999999999997s)]
*  That's the first problem, proving this. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2533.32s)]
*  And there's always two sides. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2535.24s)]
*  And so I don't know that she'll be able to prove [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2537.08s)]
*  what's being alleged. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2538.72s)]
*  But the second thing is there's a difference [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2539.84s)]
*  between what she's alleging, [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2541.28s)]
*  like intentional sexual harassment and well, [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2542.48s)]
*  things that in retrospect should have been done differently [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2545.6400000000003s)]
*  on the movie set that would have made her more comfortable. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2548.1200000000003s)]
*  That's what all this sounds like, right? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2550.36s)]
*  And the third thing is, [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2552.4s)]
*  jurors always look, and it's legally proper, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2553.6000000000004s)]
*  towards the person bringing the suit and saying, [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2557.08s)]
*  well, what else could you have done? [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2559.56s)]
*  She doesn't seem like a very passive, soft flower. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2561.4s)]
*  She would have spoken up and saying, I will not do this. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2565.7200000000003s)]
*  I don't want all these people on this set. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2568.64s)]
*  I don't want this, I don't want that. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2570.64s)]
*  So they're gonna be looking at her as well. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2572.3599999999997s)]
*  That's the thing. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2574.96s)]
*  So she makes it sound in this complaint, Arthur, [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2575.7999999999997s)]
*  like she is this powerless, shrinking violet. [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2578.2799999999997s)]
*  This one I circled in particular. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2581.2799999999997s)]
*  She was not provided with anything with which [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2583.16s)]
*  to cover herself between takes [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2585.2799999999997s)]
*  until after she had made multiple requests. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2586.8399999999997s)]
*  Does anyone really believe Blake Lively, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2590.2799999999997s)]
*  who had 100 times the star power and regular power [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2593.12s)]
*  of anybody on that set, was sitting there naked going, [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2596.8s)]
*  somebody please get me a cover, multiple requests. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2600.28s)]
*  Get me a cover, get me a cover. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2603.0s)]
*  And everyone just blew her off like, ah, screw her. [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2604.52s)]
*  Of course, it does not sound reasonable at all. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2608.1600000000003s)]
*  Also, she says, it doesn't say in my contract [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2611.28s)]
*  anything about nudity, but my understanding is [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2613.92s)]
*  it did say there was a childbirth scene, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2616.04s)]
*  and there is some degree of nudity [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2618.36s)]
*  in any kind of childbirth. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2621.0800000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2622.48s)]
*  But they're just gonna do it from the neck up. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2623.32s)]
*  They don't come out of your nose. [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2624.8s)]
*  No, not that I know of. [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2626.96s)]
*  It's pretty clear. [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2629.32s)]
*  Well, look, I'm looking at that birth scene. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2631.0800000000004s)]
*  I can't see what's there. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2633.8s)]
*  And that's obvious. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2636.0s)]
*  The filmmakers don't want you to see [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2636.84s)]
*  if she's wearing a pair of black shorts. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2637.84s)]
*  It kind of suspends disbelief on the giving birth claims. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2639.36s)]
*  But in any event, I wanna go on just for another minute [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2644.52s)]
*  about what Adam Monshine is alleging. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2648.48s)]
*  He played Dr. Dunbar in that scene. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2651.52s)]
*  He says, yeah, my experience working with her [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2654.12s)]
*  is very different than the one she described in her lawsuit. [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2657.16s)]
*  Indeed, I was surprised to read her description of the scene. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2660.44s)]
*  He goes on about the costume, as I read before. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2663.68s)]
*  Then he further alleged that Lively never complained [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2666.52s)]
*  or expressed discomfort at any point [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2669.84s)]
*  because nothing unusual or improper occurred. [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2672.4s)]
*  It was extremely professional. [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2674.96s)]
*  And of course, he was there for all of it [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2676.7599999999998s)]
*  because he was playing the OB right between the legs. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2678.36s)]
*  He called Lively's insinuations [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2681.0s)]
*  about his acting qualifications offensive [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2682.72s)]
*  as his bona fides are easily searchable online [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2685.2799999999997s)]
*  and says, by the way, I was actually a local hire. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2688.8399999999997s)]
*  My wife and I are from New York [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2693.12s)]
*  and we spent significant time there. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2694.72s)]
*  And apparently that's where the scene was shot [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2696.3599999999997s)]
*  and said, if I'm called to testify in this case, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2698.9199999999996s)]
*  I will answer truthfully. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2700.6s)]
*  And he says, in particular, I will note that Ms. Lively [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2702.12s)]
*  was not quote, nearly nude in the scene we shot together. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2707.68s)]
*  So here's the takeaway. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2711.72s)]
*  You tell me what you think. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2713.16s)]
*  This is how Brian Friedman and Justin Baldoni [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2715.8399999999997s)]
*  are gonna win this case. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2718.16s)]
*  You don't have to take all 20 of her allegations. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2719.8799999999997s)]
*  Pick your top four, right? [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2723.64s)]
*  And show you don't have to take Baldoni's word [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2725.64s)]
*  on the birth scene. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2729.08s)]
*  Listen to Adam Monsheim, who is telling you he was there. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2730.24s)]
*  And by the way, here are the raw film outtakes [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2734.2s)]
*  from the whole thing where you can see [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2739.68s)]
*  she is wearing black shorts. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2742.12s)]
*  She does not have just a thin piece of fabric [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2744.2s)]
*  separating her genitalia from everybody there. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2746.7599999999998s)]
*  And let's sit and listen to her alleged multiple requests [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2749.68s)]
*  for a cover which everyone blew her. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2754.2s)]
*  I bet it's not gonna be there. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2756.0s)]
*  So how powerful a piece of evidence is this [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2757.56s)]
*  for an effective trial, guys? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2760.4399999999996s)]
*  Huge, Megan. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2762.48s)]
*  Arthur and I, who are artists in creating reasonable doubt, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2763.8399999999997s)]
*  will tell the jury that if there's reasonable doubt [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2767.52s)]
*  created as to one allegation, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2771.68s)]
*  while we might not be able to disprove the others, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2774.2s)]
*  it shows what's going on here. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2776.64s)]
*  That the person was caught in a lie, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2779.32s)]
*  they're willing to manufacture allegations, [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2781.6s)]
*  at least as it relates to some things. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2784.32s)]
*  And so you can disregard her entire testimony. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2786.44s)]
*  So yes, I think this is colossal. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2789.2400000000002s)]
*  It's not even, you know, Mark and I are criminal guys. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2791.52s)]
*  So it's not even reasonable doubt under these circumstances. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2793.72s)]
*  It's even a lesser standard. [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2796.12s)]
*  But you know, you also Megan have to think [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2797.88s)]
*  about the lawyering, the lawyering here. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2799.72s)]
*  When you're gonna make, when she's gonna make this claim, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2802.08s)]
*  you have to tell your client, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2804.12s)]
*  okay, I heard what you said. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2805.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, there's gonna be like, [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2807.4s)]
*  there were like 12 other people in the room [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2808.4s)]
*  or according to you even more. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2810.24s)]
*  And they're gonna know, you know, [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2812.04s)]
*  they're gonna be witnesses as well. [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2813.2s)]
*  They're gonna support the fact that you didn't have, [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2814.96s)]
*  that you know, you were naked, right? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2817.12s)]
*  No one's gonna say you had shorts on, right? [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2818.4s)]
*  And they're all gonna say, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2820.24s)]
*  they're all gonna support the fact [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2821.56s)]
*  that you asked to be covered up [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2822.72s)]
*  and nobody helped you, correct? [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2824.56s)]
*  Like you gotta admit, now maybe the lawyer did [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2827.0s)]
*  and she's like, oh, absolutely. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2828.92s)]
*  I didn't have anything on it. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2830.32s)]
*  No, it's all the time. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2831.16s)]
*  And maybe the film will show that in her defense. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2832.0s)]
*  Maybe the film will show that. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2833.44s)]
*  And you know, this guy will be proven wrong. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2834.7999999999997s)]
*  Keep going. [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2836.52s)]
*  And the bottom line is when you're on the plaintiff's side [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2838.44s)]
*  before you make these claims, [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2842.56s)]
*  you better do some homework [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2844.72s)]
*  and some of your own investigation work. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2846.56s)]
*  Because as the lawyer, your reputation is on the line. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2848.12s)]
*  You're the one who signs that complaint [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2851.08s)]
*  and says, you know, I'm submitting these papers. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2853.4s)]
*  And it sounds like from this witness, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2855.84s)]
*  which sounds like a very credible guy here, [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2858.2000000000003s)]
*  that you know, that she either lied to her lawyer [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2860.6s)]
*  or her lawyer didn't do her homework. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2863.8s)]
*  It's her own. [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2865.32s)]
*  It sounds like somebody the jury's gonna like. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2866.1600000000003s)]
*  That's my gut instinct. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2867.6s)]
*  And they're not gonna like that she smeared him [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2868.6800000000003s)]
*  as just a best friend who was trying [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2870.44s)]
*  to get a look at her vag. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2871.76s)]
*  Last but not least, this woman, Christina Formella, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2873.84s)]
*  30 years old, Illinois teacher, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2876.96s)]
*  accused of molesting a 15 year old student [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2878.6800000000003s)]
*  who was on a soccer team she coached. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2881.2400000000002s)]
*  And whom she tutored, allegedly happened [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2883.7599999999998s)]
*  in a Downers Grove high school classroom in December, 2023. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2886.52s)]
*  At the time she was 28, he was 15. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2891.36s)]
*  And they had a sexual interlude. [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2893.92s)]
*  There may have been more than one. [[00:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2897.68s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2899.04s)]
*  There are text messages in which she texts him, [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2900.2s)]
*  I love you so much baby. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2903.52s)]
*  Even though this morning was short, it was perfect. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2905.16s)]
*  And she wrote directly to him, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2908.2799999999997s)]
*  I love having sex with you. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2911.4s)]
*  Now she's claiming he wrote those texts on her phone, [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2913.76s)]
*  which he stole from her. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2918.02s)]
*  And then he deleted the record on her phone [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2919.52s)]
*  so she wouldn't see that he had done this. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2921.52s)]
*  She's in a lot of trouble out in Illinois right now. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2924.96s)]
*  And you tell me how this case is likely to get resolved. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2927.6800000000003s)]
*  Yeah, Mark. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2932.2000000000003s)]
*  As you know, the heart wants what the heart wants, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2933.04s)]
*  even if they are, even if it was a 15 year old. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2934.84s)]
*  Arthur, she's going to prison. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2937.4s)]
*  They've got enough evidence. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2939.52s)]
*  The things that she's alleging on the defense [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2941.64s)]
*  are not supported by the evidence, [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2942.8s)]
*  including the things that she claimed that her husband knew. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2944.44s)]
*  She is going to get what she deserves. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2947.16s)]
*  And it appears, if I read this correctly, [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2951.08s)]
*  that eventually she fessed up to some piece of this. [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2953.68s)]
*  I gotta find out where is that? [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2960.96s)]
*  She did, she fessed up to some piece of this. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2962.72s)]
*  Where is it? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2965.88s)]
*  I can't find it. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2966.72s)]
*  Because it's in black and white. [[00:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2967.54s)]
*  She can't deny these things. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2968.88s)]
*  Yeah, okay. [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2971.08s)]
*  It says, okay, she fessed up to having, okay, [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2972.2000000000003s)]
*  Formella later fessed up to having a relationship [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2977.2000000000003s)]
*  with the boy, prosecutors say. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2979.7200000000003s)]
*  Quote, defendant admitted she knew the relationship [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2982.36s)]
*  was wrong, but she was unable to stop it [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2985.28s)]
*  because she cares too much about him. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2987.76s)]
*  And in another tape, she says she was just too hot. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2989.6800000000003s)]
*  And that's why people say things about her that aren't nice. [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2993.36s)]
*  Like I said, the heart wants what the heart wants. [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2996.0s)]
*  This is Arthur's defense to everything. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=2998.4s)]
*  I was too hot. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3000.92s)]
*  Arthur, don't deny it. [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3001.76s)]
*  Megan, here's my defense. [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3004.2400000000002s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, the casting couch, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3005.6s)]
*  is that a crime scene? [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3007.7200000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3010.32s)]
*  I mean, I'm open-minded. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3011.76s)]
*  I wanna hear where that goes. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3012.8s)]

*  Awesome, I was just saying, like, so when we first talked, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3159.68s)]
*  it was like the height of the pandemic nonsense. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3161.7999999999997s)]
*  Everything was still locked down. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3164.2s)]
*  And I remember one of the things we discussed was [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3166.24s)]
*  how comedians are being canceled left and right. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3169.0s)]
*  Yeah, it was a weird time. [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3171.6s)]
*  People were very uptight, and people were very tense. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3172.8s)]
*  And there was a lot of anger, [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3176.6s)]
*  and a lot of it was coming for comedy. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3178.96s)]
*  A lot of it was pointed in that direction. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3181.8s)]
*  I feel like now people have, it's dissipated. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3183.96s)]
*  People are more relaxed. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3186.4s)]
*  I think, I mean, not in every facet of life, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3188.76s)]
*  but certainly with comedy, people are relaxing, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3191.56s)]
*  and common sense is coming back, [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3193.88s)]
*  and I think people are having more fun. [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3195.68s)]
*  How do we get there? [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3197.2400000000002s)]
*  How did we finally get to the point where we took our boot [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3198.08s)]
*  off the necks of the comedians? [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3201.0s)]
*  I think it was just, you know, people, I think, [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3202.8s)]
*  realized that they were being silly. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3205.32s)]
*  I think what happened was people were being a bit ridiculous. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3207.8s)]
*  They were going overboard. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3211.2s)]
*  I think it tends to happen. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3212.32s)]
*  I think we're in like a little bit of a moral panic [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3214.08s)]
*  where people were trying to assert at every moment [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3216.88s)]
*  how good they were. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3220.56s)]
*  And I think people just got tired of that. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3222.24s)]
*  I think it's exhausting. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3224.48s)]
*  I think not having fun is actually very tiring. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3226.08s)]
*  Being a stickler is very tiring. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3229.24s)]
*  It's very exhausting. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3231.24s)]
*  And I think people just got to a point when, you know, [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3232.08s)]
*  they realized that that was not only a terrible way to live, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3234.8799999999997s)]
*  but it's also not effective. [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3239.7599999999998s)]
*  The world that they want isn't going to be manifested [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3241.8399999999997s)]
*  through scolding people. [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3246.0s)]
*  So I think they realized that. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3248.04s)]
*  I hope you're right. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3249.56s)]
*  I hope we're done with that period forever more. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3250.3999999999996s)]
*  So it's funny, because we didn't do a ton of your bio, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3253.2s)]

*  Yeah, so it was after the murders. It was after the murders at Comedy Central [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3339.2s)]
*  This campaign where they were trying to get people to stop watching the trial and start watching comic [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3343.62s)]
*  Okay, so that is just say no Jay campaign and it's satirized how insane people had become with the trial [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3349.1s)]

*  Wild kid and I have because of your child acting it was probably because of that also because my parents were kind of [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3460.92s)]
*  I loved them both. They were just boomers and they were a little checked out [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3467.6400000000003s)]
*  Parenting was a little different [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3472.1200000000003s)]
*  Back then very it was not as intense as it is now [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3474.4s)]
*  There was there was no tracker on a phone that knew where I was [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3480.8s)]
*  You would go to the park you would ride your bike you would leave and I had a lot of older friends and they were into [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3485.84s)]
*  drugs and I got into it through them and [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3492.68s)]
*  You know, it was a little bit of a wild ride for about 10 years [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3496.36s)]
*  Oh really that 10 years and now now 15 years sober of all things so nothing you don't you don't you don't do anything [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3499.36s)]
*  Nothing. It's kind of a blessing. It's a good thing to get out of your system young [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3505.48s)]
*  I mean that that young that way like when you can still save your liver, you know [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3509.64s)]
*  You stop drinking at 25 or whatever. Yeah, I stopped your good 25 and [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3514.6s)]
*  You know, but it was a it was a time where I learned a lot about life [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3519.56s)]
*  Doing all that stuff. I wouldn't recommend it. No other ways [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3524.56s)]
*  Learn about life if you're watching this, you know take a class or something gonna put junior on the Tim Dillon. Yeah [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3529.2400000000002s)]
*  I read a book, but I learned a lot about life doing that you learn a lot about [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3535.44s)]
*  Accountability being an addict you learn a lot about not blaming other people for your problems [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3541.7200000000003s)]
*  You learn that when you come out of the addiction you learn it when you come out of it [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3549.36s)]
*  Yeah, you learn it when you come out of it, which is a great lesson [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3552.32s)]
*  Well, I I was sort of laughing at first thinking it couldn't have been his short stint as a child actor [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3554.92s)]
*  Yeah, it turns out that your mom has a serious mental illness [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3559.6s)]
*  Yes, and I'm sure that was stressful to grow up with well, she was a schizophrenic and that was hard it became more [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3563.44s)]
*  obvious when I was older and it was difficult because when you're when you're younger you're you're not you look at your parents and [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3570.28s)]
*  your mother as a [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3579.0400000000004s)]
*  authority figure who's like, you know, who's [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3580.92s)]
*  You know, maybe maybe wise or certainly [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3585.6400000000003s)]
*  You know [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3590.84s)]
*  You know integral to your growing up and then realizing that she's a very fallible person with [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3592.52s)]
*  Problems is a hard thing to realize and then realize you can't do anything about it. You can't really do anything about it [[00:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3599.2s)]
*  You have to accept it be be the best you can be [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3605.2400000000002s)]
*  Then live with it and deal with it. So, I mean, I think that was something too. That was difficult [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3609.84s)]
*  Did you like experience her what she was having delusions? Yeah, I mean it's true an Irish Catholic family [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3613.6s)]
*  We were very we weren't big on the term schizophrenic. We were for a while there. We just thought she was eccentric or fun [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3619.56s)]
*  You know the patties fun. I would say something she'd go I think like, you know, your uncle is like a [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3627.9199999999996s)]
*  CIA agent or something and we'd all go she's a boot [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3635.0s)]
*  She's fun and then we started realizing. Oh, it's a mental disorder. You know manageable like it wasn't like it was manageable [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3638.72s)]
*  She worked very hard. She really really worked and then I think around [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3645.56s)]
*  In her 40s, she started it started to progress and get worse [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3649.8799999999997s)]
*  So how do you parlay that into comedy is or is that just more the Irish Catholic strain I think you parlay it into [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3654.84s)]
*  Something creative doesn't have to be comedy [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3664.1600000000003s)]
*  But for me it was like there was a lot of stuff that in order to deal with it. You could be funny about it [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3667.1600000000003s)]
*  That's the way to deal with a lot of coping mechanism. Yeah, it's coping mechanism [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3672.7200000000003s)]
*  There's a lot of people that have had mental illness in their family [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3676.2400000000002s)]
*  Right great novels about it or their you know, right a playwright or their musician or something [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3678.88s)]
*  but for me comedy made sense because it was a way to kind of [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3684.92s)]
*  goof about things that were [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3688.6400000000003s)]
*  You know incredibly painful. Yeah, you know and you couldn't understand so you didn't really understand it [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3691.4s)]
*  I think that's a big thing in [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3697.6s)]
*  Comedy trying to make sense of things in a funny way. So another friend of mine who was a child actor [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3700.52s)]
*  Yeah, for reals, right she started a little house on the prairie [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3704.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, wow, sorry, okay, I feel like she would have advocated for you. Yeah, where's she now? [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3707.56s)]
*  I'm kidding probably very well. She she's doing very well, but do very well, but she [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3712.44s)]
*  Wrote a book called diary of a stage mother's daughter Wow talk about her mother was just totally overbearing and definitely [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3717.2000000000003s)]
*  had some mental issues or and [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3723.84s)]
*  She writes about this in the book [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3726.48s)]
*  But she she's always worried as she gets more mature it am I gonna have any of those wars and she's not yeah [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3728.4s)]
*  But it seems like a natural worry. Yes. How do you deal with that? [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3734.88s)]
*  Well, I do a podcast if I become a schizophrenic I make more money [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3738.08s)]
*  So I have a career everyone would listen to that. No one would know in fact [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3742.6s)]
*  It would be multiple years before anyone suggested something was off. In fact people go it's getting really good [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3746.7200000000003s)]
*  So I have a career where if I were to become a schizophrenic people because actually getting really good [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3753.12s)]
*  So I'm not as worried about that as I would be if I was like a lawyer or something [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3758.8s)]
*  It would become more apparent. Yes. Yeah, okay that makes sense [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3763.64s)]
*  Yeah, I hear we have something in common and that is our mutual love for Meghan Markle [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3766.72s)]
*  Yes, I hear you're ready to endorse her for president. I like her now [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3772.72s)]

*  I think they're fun. They're an important part of America and the tapestry of our country [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3781.22s)]
*  they to me exude a [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3787.04s)]
*  A [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3790.2400000000002s)]

*  And I find her to be a great con artist one of the great [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3795.44s)]
*  Con of the great time one of the greats, you know, this is someone who came to prominence marrying into [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3799.48s)]

*  There's nothing better than that from where she started to where she is now [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3832.0s)]
*  And that's what I think a lot of it is I think a lot of people that claim to be really [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3837.08s)]
*  Evolved people who really want to help other people are just trying she just wants a line of consumer goods [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=3842.68s)]

*  Launching a business it can be [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4143.9400000000005s)]
*  So overwhelming even with the best of teams. Whoo. It'll keep you up at night [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4145.98s)]
*  for example a month ago, I was [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4152.219999999999s)]
*  absolutely [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4155.5s)]
*  consumed [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4157.0599999999995s)]
*  with packaging [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4158.419999999999s)]
*  Boxes [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4161.0199999999995s)]
*  It's all I could think about and I would sit there doing the unboxing in my head [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4162.259999999999s)]
*  Is there tissue paper? What about the packing peanuts, but they're biodegradable and where does the sticker go and hold on? [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4166.74s)]
*  And what size the box is gonna be? You know, that's not gonna fit all the skews [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4170.94s)]
*  Oh my gosh, and then someone says but you don't want to brand the outside of the box because a porch pirate [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4173.3s)]
*  Had never heard that before what's a porch pirate and then I'm sitting there [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4178.46s)]
*  I'm like does any of this actually matter? Of course it matters. It matters at the beginning, but how much does it matter? Oh [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4182.46s)]
*  my god [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4189.860000000001s)]

*  That's right, they quit on any given day on any given day the staff will quit [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4200.66s)]
*  Because she just you know launches into a tirade and for whatever reason they feel unsafe [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4205.82s)]
*  She's been accused multiple times of being a bullying abuser. Well, she's throwing honey at people's heads and stuff [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4212.42s)]
*  So she's kept up at night wondering about what lawsuits was coming for land [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4218.62s)]
*  Because of the abusive behavior towards the staff like that didn't that sound bite just hit so many of the leftist boxes like are they biodegradable? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4223.26s)]
*  Yes, and what does the packaging? Well what I like about her actually I've gone the other way now because now that she's coming out as a monster [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4230.62s)]
*  I [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4238.46s)]
*  Like like I'm actually on board now into it [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4240.02s)]
*  I'm into it because now by the way, she's no longer even there's no longer even an attempt [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4242.9800000000005s)]
*  It's such a thinly veiled attempt. Yeah to be this conscientious [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4250.1s)]
*  Person who you know, she's really just saying like I'm a founder. Yeah, I'm a founder and I'm a big business [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4255.7s)]
*  Tycoon and it's tough for me. Can I tell you she's not the only extremely rich woman? [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4264.219999999999s)]
*  Yeah, who you know in her case? [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4269.0199999999995s)]
*  Questionable but a lot of these other women's cases they their husbands are multi millionaires or billionaires [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4272.34s)]
*  And then the women like open a charity. Yes, or like give their money to somebody and then they're like I'm an entrepreneur [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4277.34s)]
*  I'm an entrepreneur. It's like I'm a founder. Look, I appreciate [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4283.5s)]
*  People with jam like yeah [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4288.26s)]
*  I see that your husband made billions of dollars right the fact that you spent some of it right doesn't make you a founder [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4290.7s)]
*  Well, it's also she never cared. You know, it was all about in the beginning [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4297.1s)]
*  It was all about like unwinding the systems of oppression. Yeah, they remember that stun [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4301.22s)]
*  Didn't you know I'm for that you saw that remember that it was like she would go to like a third-world country [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4306.02s)]
*  And there'd be a bunch of kids dancing and she'd take a photo with them now [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4311.06s)]
*  It seems much more about like she's looking at like Gwyneth Pouch or what Gwyneth Pouch it did with her store [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4315.42s)]
*  Yes, goop or whatever. It's I think it's goop. Yeah, and I think she's looking at that going [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4321.02s)]
*  That's what she wants to be. She wants to be Martha Stewart [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4325.46s)]
*  Yeah, although what I found out after the fact was she launched her show with showing you how to make this one recipe [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4327.18s)]
*  It's like one pop pasta you get on that stove and then everybody flooded Twitter with the fact that that [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4334.14s)]
*  Apparently is a Martha Stewart recipe. Sure. That's apparently very well known in Martha Stewart. Yeah. Yeah [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4340.82s)]
*  So even the inaugural episode is is cheating off of somebody else's well [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4345.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean you gotta hand it to her it she knows that we don't have a memory [[01:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4350.24s)]
*  Yes, the country doesn't have a memory [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4354.7s)]
*  We have a fatally short memory and we're kind of tolerant of however people want to reintroduce themselves in the moment [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4357.18s)]
*  Yes, so she understands America [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4364.38s)]
*  I didn't know better than I do or maybe you do because she gets it [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4366.54s)]
*  We love the Huckster we root for the Huckster [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4371.22s)]
*  Yes, we root for kind of the criminal sometimes and she's kind of assuming that role of going. This is why I'm today [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4374.18s)]
*  Right. Yeah, I found my wave. I'm gonna ride on my wave now speaking of not having a memory [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4380.58s)]

*  It's the seventh largest economy in the world or whatever. He's saying how in God's name [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4431.46s)]
*  Do you have the time to do a pod? Can you imagine launching a podcast in the ash heap of? [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4436.62s)]
*  Your state he's now doing a pot. Is he gonna have ads? Is he gonna read ads? [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4442.22s)]
*  It's Gavin Newsom gonna read ads while people try to find housing in his state [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4446.38s)]
*  It's such a good point, yeah, he's totally copying you well, you know what it is he [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4451.22s)]
*  Watching him try and fail to be a human being is a very interesting thing [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4457.9400000000005s)]
*  and and that's what he's been kind of doing, you know Gavin is a [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4464.14s)]

*  How many times did he say I'm standing with Biden he said it so many times [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4476.900000000001s)]
*  It was like the lady doth protest too much. Yeah, he clearly thought he was angling for that. They [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4482.18s)]
*  Got passed over. Okay for for a [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4488.42s)]
*  unpopular [[01:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4492.54s)]

*  he thinks he's coming back again and [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4496.06s)]
*  He's trying everything he can to appear like a human being [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4499.06s)]
*  When you're so ambitious [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4503.900000000001s)]
*  Markle Newsom, it's the same type of person. They just want the thing whatever it is. They want the [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4505.900000000001s)]
*  Title they want the status. They don't believe in anything Gavin Newsom doesn't believe in it. Megan Markle doesn't believe in anything [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4514.5s)]
*  so when you have [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4521.7s)]
*  People like that their guiding principle is only ambition [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4524.18s)]
*  My Harris didn't believe in anything now say what you want about Donald Trump [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4527.38s)]
*  He said the same thing about tariffs for 30 40 years. Yes, okay [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4531.34s)]
*  People like [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4536.900000000001s)]
*  Kamala Harris or Gavin Newsom just want the thing. It's a vibes based thing [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4538.78s)]
*  They want people to feel a certain way. They want to make people feel assertive. So when you saw him say to Charlie Kirk [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4545.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's just for me. It's a fairness issue about boys playing in girls sports. Yeah, you know claiming that they're girls [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4551.66s)]
*  It's just it's a fairness issue [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4556.3s)]
*  You know I've got daughters right and then just this week somebody asked him about it because they tried to push through a bill out [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4557.62s)]
*  In California that you know, yeah, and he it didn't go anywhere. They didn't protect girls [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4562.22s)]
*  No, and he's like, you know, I just I just can't figure it out [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4566.5s)]
*  I just I tried to think about how to make him a friend. I just can't figure it out [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4568.46s)]
*  He goes I just want to be president. That's really wants to do what he's saying. It's really what he wants to do [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4571.74s)]
*  He doesn't have a specific set of beliefs. He doesn't care. It doesn't mean anything to him [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4576.3s)]
*  So he'll pander to anybody like anybody if you were across from Donald Trump you think he'd pander? Absolutely [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4581.34s)]
*  Because the way that people like Gavin Newsom get far the way that people like Kamala Harris get far [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4586.38s)]
*  There's a lot of Republicans by the way who get far the same way is they don't have a fixed set of principles [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4591.900000000001s)]
*  Because if you have a fixed set of principles Bernie Sanders, whatever you want to say about him has a fixed set of principles [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4598.38s)]
*  You know for the most part he's been saying a lot of the same things for 30 years [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4603.660000000001s)]
*  Yeah [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4607.900000000001s)]
*  Now that means that eventually someone comes around to you or you're out there in the cold [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4608.46s)]
*  Now Gavin and Kamala people like that. They don't ever want to be out in the cold [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4614.34s)]
*  They constantly want to be in the rooms that matter [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4617.54s)]
*  So you have to go with the flow when the the world goes a certain way you got to go with the world [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4620.34s)]
*  So when americans render a verdict on the on the biological men in women's sports and say we don't want this [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4626.0199999999995s)]
*  Gavin Newsom then has to move in that direction [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4631.78s)]
*  But when he's in his own state and he's asked about it and the time is to do something about it [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4635.0599999999995s)]
*  He's constantly monitoring and going is this the right thing to say here is this the right thing to say there so [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4640.74s)]
*  He can have it all he can he can try but he's definitely trying his popularity is plummeting that doesn't work anymore [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4647.54s)]
*  That's my I guess thought about it the way that politics has worked forever, which was Gavin Newsom's [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4655.38s)]
*  Kamala it's been people say whatever the hell you have to say whatever the hell you have to lindsey graham [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4662.18s)]
*  Is like a lot of times says whatever he has everywhere right he's everywhere these people don't care about anything [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4666.58s)]
*  That's not working anymore because of the internet [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4671.78s)]
*  You're able to immediately go. Wait a minute. You said that last week [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4674.98s)]
*  What where do you where are you on this now? You're just a phony. You're a phony and you put together these [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4680.26s)]
*  You know compilations of people just being for it and against it and this and that it doesn't work anymore [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4685.94s)]
*  And I think that's going that's a major change. So one person who is the opposite of that [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4690.98s)]
*  He's completely authentic. Yeah, his weirdness his greatness his brilliance is robert f. kennedy jr [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4695.7s)]
*  He's 100 percent. He feels the way he feels [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4702.9s)]
*  Agree or disagree. Yeah, he's 100 percent been saying the same thing for 30 years [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4706.5s)]
*  Even the picadillos even like yeah, we cut off the head of a bear and like whatever right and also a whale [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4711.14s)]
*  Right, right. Yeah, it was a thing and I used to be addicted to heroin, right? [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4716.98s)]
*  You know, right like he's not trying to impress you or downplay anything he's done [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4720.34s)]
*  No, um, and so I know that you became his fan and his friend. Yes, i'm friends with him. I got to know about this [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4725.0599999999995s)]
*  I got a good dude. Have you done social things with him? Yeah, him and his wife are great. Cheryl's grades [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4730.98s)]

*  Yeah, yeah, yeah the legit. Yeah for an irish catholic guy. That's a pretty good. Did anybody die or is it was good? It was fine [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4744.0199999999995s)]
*  No, no one died. Thankfully, but they do dangerous activities [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4749.46s)]
*  There is it's not like you can see how it happens. Yeah, yeah, you can see they're adrenaline junkies. You know what I mean? [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4752.58s)]
*  They're they're very much [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4758.18s)]
*  Um, did you meet schlossberg the the son the grandson of jfk because he seems to be a little he's they seem to be on opposite sides [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4759.86s)]
*  Yeah, don't worry about that. Okay. Um, yeah, no, they seem very opposite [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4767.14s)]
*  Yeah, so he was there and the whole family was there because he's persona non-grub. He was not there [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4770.5s)]
*  I actually went with his kids. He wasn't there him and cheryl weren't there that weekend [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4774.58s)]
*  They were somewhere else, but they could have been there. I think they're like listen. It's a family. They disagree about stuff [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4777.86s)]
*  It's a high-stakes family. They disagree about a lot of stuff and it's very public [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4781.94s)]
*  Yeah, but I think at the end of the day it it it it is a family [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4785.54s)]
*  and it's a you know [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4789.54s)]
*  Important family in in terms of the history of america [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4792.26s)]
*  So when you have as I don't know him like that, I've yeah, I supported him [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4795.78s)]
*  But I don't know him personally like that. So when you have dinner with rfkj [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4799.14s)]
*  Does he always talk policy and history? He talks a lot about that stuff and he's very very passionate about it [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4803.14s)]
*  And again, you don't get the vibe that this is someone angling to be [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4809.78s)]
*  Famous. Yeah, that's not why genuinely that's not why he like, you know went after [[01:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4815.38s)]
*  polluters forever when that was incredibly unpopular [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4821.2s)]
*  That's not why he talked about vaccines during the pandemic when that was incredibly unpopular [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4825.06s)]
*  He feels the way he feels and I think that [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4830.900000000001s)]
*  The only way to get out of the the the climate we're in in in in america in the sense of like [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4834.099999999999s)]
*  We need people who have genuine convictions [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4840.18s)]
*  And they can debate about them and they can argue about them [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4843.46s)]
*  But we need people with genuine conviction and he has genuine convictions. How do you think sheryl is surviving? [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4845.78s)]
*  Yeah in the hollywood crowd [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4850.9s)]
*  I think it's I think she's a incredibly funny [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4853.38s)]
*  smart talented person who's [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4856.9s)]
*  Respected in her own right is a great actress great comedic actress [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4859.379999999999s)]
*  I think she has real friends and real relationships and I think [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4863.139999999999s)]
*  I think that that's also changing a lot of people in that state [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4866.259999999999s)]
*  And in that business are also starting to moderate a little bit because I think they're starting to see that [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4870.179999999999s)]
*  You know, they have drifted far from the mainstream of american life [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4877.299999999999s)]
*  And I think they're starting to come back and what what he's saying is like maha is basically [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4882.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, let's let's try to help make the country safer the kids healthier. Yeah, the moms and dads healthier [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4887.7s)]
*  He just said this is in our am update today. He he wants to find a cure or diagnosis [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4893.94s)]
*  No, the cause of autism by september. Yeah, it's it feels like a moonshot, right? It's like we've been trying [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4898.74s)]
*  Like who's he against that? [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4906.82s)]
*  Yeah, I I think [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4908.58s)]
*  the the [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4910.42s)]
*  problem with everything now is that [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4911.46s)]
*  People have a visceral reaction [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4914.26s)]
*  to [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4917.94s)]
*  certain people [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4919.0599999999995s)]
*  meaning like [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4920.66s)]
*  For whatever reason there are certain people like steve bannon on my show. I had liberals calling me going [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4922.179999999999s)]
*  Oh my god, I agree with you bannon. Yes, and they go [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4928.5s)]
*  And he'd go wow this guy made a lot of great points, but there are certain people [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4934.82s)]
*  Who will who said I cannot believe you? [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4939.62s)]
*  I will never listen [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4943.3s)]
*  This guy's a white supremacist. He's a not and I go he's none of that [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4945.7s)]
*  Yeah, listen to the episode so these people that I think are not listening and there are people that disagree with rfk too [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4949.86s)]
*  And that's fine. There's people that are principled [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4954.98s)]
*  Disagreements with rfk and go I think you're wrong, but you know, there's so many people on the left who are like [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4957.68s)]
*  I'm against you team trump. Yeah, it's a no. Sure [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4962.9s)]
*  Um, and so I just wonder you know, I think she's probably surviving because she's married to bobby and not donald, you know [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4966.099999999999s)]
*  Like that. Yeah, i think she's also could be your gateway drug [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4971.7s)]
*  Like trump is the real deal. So, you know, listen your real friends become a parent in these situations and i'm sure she knows who they are [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4976.18s)]
*  Yeah, well in hollywood, it's always hard. Isn't it? It's tough [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4983.46s)]
*  What you were saying about people have very strong feelings about people [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4986.74s)]
*  My husband saw some article. I don't know if I got fed to him and it was about the height of our children [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4989.54s)]
*  Somebody did an article online about the height of our children. Yeah, it was all messed up [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4994.98s)]
*  It had all sort of fake facts about my kids. We don't show our kids on the air, of course, um, or on on the internet at all [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=4998.82s)]
*  But naeve it so he forwarded it [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5005.78s)]
*  And uh, we were looking at it. It was kind of funny [[01:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5008.82s)]
*  Speculating about the height and how they get so tall like we gave him hgh which we didn't they just have a tall father [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5011.36s)]
*  It's hilarious. Um, and and there's a line in there saying megan kelly who many people can't stand and then [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5016.42s)]
*  Yeah [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5022.9s)]
*  Wow that seems unnecessary yeah for an article about the children's height [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5025.379999999999s)]
*  Yeah, wow, that was kind of below the belt hilarious because of the territory. Yeah. Yeah, of course certainly if you're a lightning rod [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5029.219999999999s)]
*  In in the media in politics [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5035.62s)]
*  You know, you got to be able to take it [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5038.099999999999s)]
*  And so I think sheryl went from a life of being like pretty much beloved by everybody. She wasn't controversial [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5039.299999999999s)]
*  To I don't think she disagrees with some of his stuff, right? I don't think they agree on everything [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5044.42s)]
*  I think like everybody else nobody agrees with everybody on everything. I think it's fine [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5049.46s)]
*  To have a position where you go. I think rfk is right here and wrong here [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5054.5s)]
*  That's how most people feel about most people. Yeah, right. So I I think that's totally okay [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5058.98s)]
*  I think when you go he's a crackpot. He's a crank. He's completely insane [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5064.5s)]
*  And you dismiss everything he says even though you agree with some of it [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5069.139999999999s)]
*  Like I I don't disagree with everything megan markel says I like jam [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5073.54s)]
*  um [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5078.98s)]
*  so I think not, you know, everybody has to [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5080.179999999999s)]
*  You know like [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5084.339999999999s)]
*  You know, I think you take it issue. That's how I felt. There are some things. I agree with joe biden [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5085.86s)]
*  I believe that's right. Of course chocolate chocolate chip ice cream is the best. Yes a thousand percent the same [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5090.179999999999s)]
*  A thousand people wrong about everything the withdrawal from afghanistan was sloppy and a mess. I agreed it was time to go [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5095.139999999999s)]
*  Not in that way [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5101.78s)]
*  So I said [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5103.219999999999s)]
*  We shouldn't be there [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5104.5s)]
*  Good for him the withdrawal was a mess. Yeah [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5106.5s)]

*  He just liked going to orgies on a yacht in international waters [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5225.62s)]
*  He comes back. He wipes the blood off himself from just throwing a woman over a boat and they said [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5230.58s)]
*  Charlie, why did you sell the factory? Why are all the umpa lumpas unfent and all and charlie says it's a shame how trans people [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5236.18s)]

*  Multinational conglomerate who's offshored all of the jobs now we say to the umpa lumpas. I hope you got your uh bitcoin [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5257.599999999999s)]

*  The american working class has been thrown [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5282.42s)]

*  In a lot of parts of the country that have been ignored and I think a lot of that has to do with the deindustrialization [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5300.0199999999995s)]
*  of the country now [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5305.64s)]

*  I don't think you could see it as as just a place to make money [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5318.04s)]
*  I think you have to see it as a place where you have a culture a country something where you have to go to war to [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5321.64s)]
*  Protect right? [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5327.320000000001s)]
*  You know, I I don't think people can just see it as a place where there are financial opportunities. Yeah [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5328.84s)]
*  We got a roaring market. Yeah, right [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5333.24s)]
*  So I think that obviously it's important that people have a good standard of living that they have money [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5335.5599999999995s)]
*  You know, we all want those things, but I also think there has to be some [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5339.08s)]
*  attention paid to [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5343.0599999999995s)]
*  Large swaths of the country that are not [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5346.92s)]
*  You know sharing in any of the prosperity of the last, you know 20 to 30 years [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5350.599999999999s)]
*  it's like [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5355.719999999999s)]
*  I've heard you talk about how like in 20 years the democrats became republicans and the republicans became the democrats, right? [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5356.679999999999s)]
*  And it's really so true in so many ways because you look at like the democrats used to talk like that [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5363.0s)]
*  Yeah, but in it got changed into [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5367.8s)]
*  All they want to do is create one big social safety net. It's just giveaways government giveaways, you know, like oh, you know [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5371.64s)]
*  You're a single mother. Here's another check right as opposed to trump's approach which seems to be let me change the whole environment around you [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5377.0s)]
*  So you have more working opportunities. Let me lighten your tax burden. You're a waitress, right? [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5384.360000000001s)]

*  Right that you'll keep voting for me party was purchased by wall street and wall street has [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5393.72s)]
*  Ideas about how the way the country should function wall street wants endless supply of cheap labor [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5399.24s)]
*  They want open borders the coke brothers loved open borders. It was because it was an endless supply of cheap labor [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5404.2s)]
*  It broke the back of the working class. It destroyed unions [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5410.04s)]
*  and it it [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5413.4s)]
*  provided [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5414.9s)]
*  Companies with with low wage labor so that their profits went up [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5415.96s)]
*  None of those profits were shared with their workers [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5419.64s)]
*  They got bigger mansions, but they got bigger mansions at the top and the democratic party became completely purchased by wall street and then [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5422.36s)]
*  identity politics is then kind of manifested as a way to convince people [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5431.08s)]
*  That actually they are interested in changing things but by changing things they don't mean giving you health care [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5436.4400000000005s)]
*  They mean giving you like a trans batman [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5441.88s)]

*  um, but [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5455.4800000000005s)]
*  You know it becomes a great, you know, there's a great quote and it's for things to stay the same [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5457.08s)]

*  What the democratic party has become as? [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5467.400000000001s)]
*  Is a party that says we're going to give you a female ceo [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5470.76s)]
*  But we're not going to give you any bit [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5474.2s)]

*  Yeah, but most people are concerned with the financial reality of their own family [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5498.92s)]
*  What do you make of as a comedian of trump and his comedy skills? [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5504.6s)]
*  Like he's the funniest politician ever and I think a lot of it is he doesn't really know that he's being funny [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5508.6s)]
*  I think he's just [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5514.2s)]
*  Being honest in his way. Yeah, right. So like he's just calling things the way he sees it [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5515.4800000000005s)]
*  He's really good at it [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5521.56s)]
*  And you know and it doesn't mean honest in the global sense because he'll say things that aren't true [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5523.24s)]
*  No politician is but when he says things [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5528.36s)]
*  That are funny, I think it's because people [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5533.4s)]
*  Are not used to hearing that from a politician [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5536.6s)]
*  The best example is the one where he gave the deposition in the e jean carol case against him and the lawyer said did you say [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5539.24s)]
*  It's okay when you're a celebrity to grab them by the p-word [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5545.72s)]
*  Yeah, when you're a celebrity they let you do it and he said yes [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5548.28s)]
*  That's because you know for thousands of years that's just been the way it is. Unfortunately or fortunately [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5551.0s)]
*  It's just him no he's what makes him effective is that he understands [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5558.68s)]
*  That there's a way that you can communicate [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5565.08s)]
*  That whether the people don't stop listening [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5568.36s)]
*  Yes, that's a big part of yeah so many politicians you turn them off very hard to turn out when he comes on [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5571.96s)]
*  He's you will never turn him on right? You don't know where it's gone [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5578.2s)]
*  I've said i'm gonna watch 10 minutes of his speech and i'm it's an hour and a half. Yes, and I watch the whole thing [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5581.08s)]

*  He comes in and out and he goes from this thing to that thing and it's very much a stream of consciousness [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5589.4s)]
*  Yes, he did the eo on the faucets making showers great again, you know, like it's a free flow of water [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5594.92s)]

*  He also doesn't patronize people like I remember like you had an adash [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5603.72s)]
*  They brought up a great point of like he shows up to this rally late and he complained about his private plane [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5606.84s)]

*  Empathize fully with someone who's you know, yeah in a different financial situation. He's saying this is who I am [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5620.04s)]
*  This is the way I see it. There's an authenticity to it. Even though people hate it [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5627.32s)]
*  Yeah, nor is he running around calling himself a founder people hate as a founder. He's right. I have some experience with this [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5631.16s)]
*  I think people hate I think there's a there's a snobbery [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5637.0s)]
*  To it where people look at him and go [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mnFCV-ZPHTI&t=5640.68s)]
