**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Friday. Yes, it's Friday [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=0.0s)]
*  Did this feel like a long week to you or a short way? I'm kind of in between [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5.28s)]
*  In any event, it's going to be a great day today. It's day 67 of the Trump administration [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=11.52s)]
*  Only 67. Can you believe that? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=17.92s)]
*  You know how like after 100 days the news media always looks back and says like what did this president accomplish? [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=19.8s)]
*  It's only day 67. He's he's lived up to virtually every single campaign promise he made it's absolutely stunning [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=25.76s)]
*  Through no [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=34.52s)]
*  Thanks of the courts who have been trying to stop him via leftist petitions to do just that at every turn and we have [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=35.2s)]
*  Breaking news on that in one second. But first just let me give you a couple of the headlines. We're looking at this morning [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=42.36s)]
*  We've got Elon Musk's Doge [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=47.44s)]

*  this seems like overdue to me because look they've been taking such a beating in the press and in terms of their reputation and so on and [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=51.839999999999996s)]
*  Finally, they spoke out. They went on with Brett Barrett last night Elon and some of his top lieutenants in Doge and what a difference [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  I think the numbers on Doge are gonna go up after that interview and pretty quickly their efforts to cut waste fraud and abuse [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=66.68s)]
*  I really now having seen them [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=73.52s)]
*  I'm like, why did they let this image of just young whippersnappers in their [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=75.56s)]
*  Backpacks and like surfer boy clothes go on as long as they did. These are studs and [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=81.11999999999999s)]

*  moments ago [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=228.04000000000002s)]
*  the Trump administration filing a petition with the US Supreme Court [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=229.48000000000002s)]
*  Asking it to review the Court of Appeals order in the judge Boasberg case on the deportations of Venezuela [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=234.16s)]
*  Suspected Venezuelan gang members. This is that been one of if not the biggest legal matter that they've been hashing out in the courts [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=243.4s)]
*  though, how can you really choose and [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=249.72s)]
*  Trump lost on Wednesday with a divided DC circuit three-judge panel a [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=253.24s)]
*  Trump appointed judge would have sided with the administration and Obama appointed judge sided with [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=259.12s)]
*  the ACLU and the [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=265.28s)]
*  Splitter was an HW Bush appointee who sided with the Obama judge and said you can't you can't use the alien enemies act [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=267.76s)]
*  To just deport a bunch of people [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=276.52s)]
*  Now here's what's interesting. So they're asking the Supreme Court for immediate review because right now what's happening is judge Boasberg's order halting [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=279.23999999999995s)]
*  These deportations stands so the Trump policy has effectively been shut down [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=287.28s)]
*  Until we get a final ruling from the US Supreme Court on this and you know [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=293.84s)]
*  There's been no like real evidentiary hearing like Trump is in there saying no the policy policy should be allowed to go forward [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=297.24s)]
*  Until we have our final order. This is wrong [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  Okay, so we'll find out what the Supreme Court does but as this happens a very interesting piece [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=307.12s)]
*  In the news this morning. Okay, it was do you have it Abby? [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=313.24s)]
*  All right now I don't think that's it hold on standby standby [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=319.64s)]
*  Okay, I've got it. Sorry. I have so much paper [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=323.2s)]
*  This is all stuff we're gonna be getting to so buckle up [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=329.24s)]
*  The question is whether [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=334.52s)]
*  The alien enemies act can be used by a president when it's not technically a time of war meaning war hasn't been [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=336.52s)]
*  declared by Congress [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=344.59999999999997s)]
*  But the president has used other language from the alien enemies act to declare an invasion or an incursion [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=346.12s)]
*  Now judge Boasberg was not convinced that a president can do that by proclamation and that if he can it's an appropriate [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=353.8s)]
*  Circumstance here and the Court of Appeals agreed with judge judge Boasberg on those points [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=360.76s)]
*  they're not convinced that this is an incursion or an [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=366.59999999999997s)]
*  invasion as [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=370.71999999999997s)]
*  Those terms would typically be used enter this piece [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=371.96s)]
*  Today it's posted on real clear politics it's by Bart Marquardt co is and [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=379.0s)]
*  He makes the strong case based on another [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=386.35999999999996s)]
*  Another piece of journalism he had witnessed that trend to Aragwa is indeed [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=390.96s)]
*  It qualifies as a military incursion that's been unleashed on us by [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=397.15999999999997s)]
*  the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=402.64s)]
*  Venezuelan government and he goes through it in great detail guys. He says [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=403.79999999999995s)]
*  there was an extraordinary article last week by Miami Herald investigative reporter Antonio Maria Delgado and [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=408.79999999999995s)]
*  Delgado interviewed a team of high-level investigators and analysts who had been following the Venezuelan regime for over 10 years [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=415.15999999999997s)]
*  The only team member to speak on the record was Gary Birdson among the most highly decorated CIA veterans in recent history [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=421.64000000000004s)]
*  The author here spoke with Birdson as well [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=427.72s)]
*  He confirmed that trend to Aragwa was purposefully sent into the US [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=430.56s)]
*  To destabilize our country by the Venezuelan government [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=436.64000000000004s)]
*  Quoting Birdson here the Venezuelan regime has assumed [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=440.12s)]
*  Operational control of these guys trend to Aragwa and has trained 300 of them [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=444.76s)]
*  They have given them paramilitary training training them to fire weapons and how to conduct sabotage [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=449.28s)]
*  They have given them all a four to six week course. They put these 300 guys [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=455.24s)]
*  Through that course and then they were deploying them into the United States to 20 separate states [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=461.8s)]
*  and [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=469.52s)]
*  The Bernsen confirming to the author here that sabotage includes arson [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=470.64s)]
*  Taking a look at the LA wildfires the cause of which we still have not yet determined and so on [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=475.64s)]
*  The CIA he says doesn't have this information according to Birdson because they refused to look at it [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=481.36s)]
*  We tried to brief them about this three years ago [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=487.26s)]
*  They were directed by the Biden administration to ignore it and now those officials are trying to undermine [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=490.68s)]
*  President Trump who listened I have to tell you as a lawyer [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=496.68s)]
*  This is a very important addendum to this argument [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=500.66s)]
*  And if if they can just get a hearing in front of this court to justify Trump's [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=504.34000000000003s)]
*  Declaration of invasion or incursion. I'll start with you on a spicer [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=511.96000000000004s)]
*  It could be a game-changer [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=516.36s)]
*  Yeah, I'm gonna go back to that. I'm sure as a lawyer, you know the case [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=518.8000000000001s)]
*  I'm gonna cite common sense versus nutjob [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=521.92s)]
*  Where it very clearly the court the court the court ruled? [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=524.4399999999999s)]
*  That you shouldn't have to argue that hard to get known gang members out of a country who came here illegally [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=529.92s)]
*  I mean this is on its face an insane idea that a president United States [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=535.6s)]
*  Has to go all the way to the Supreme Court to argue that people who are known gang members [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  Coming illegally into the country have to go through some serious process to get sent back [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=545.84s)]
*  I believe the court will side with President Trump [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=551.0400000000001s)]
*  But I think it's sad that we actually had to go to this level to do it [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=555.1600000000001s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I don't you know, this clearly has the support [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=559.6s)]
*  I think of most Americans the deportation plan in general mark has the support of most Americans [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=562.84s)]
*  Maybe they've got some questions on trend or a guava [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=567.36s)]
*  But if so that hasn't manifested in any polls I've seen I think you know the more dangerous [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=570.12s)]
*  The the potential illegals are the more Americans want them gone [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=575.6s)]
*  But you tell me how you see it because as a legal matter it's tricky [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=579.92s)]
*  But I think Trump's in the right, but the biggest matter will be [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=583.6800000000001s)]
*  Politically if the Supreme Court doesn't uphold the DC Circuit and allows Trump to do this [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=587.44s)]
*  How does it play and if they if they don't allow Trump to do this? How does it play? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=594.08s)]
*  Well Henry common sense versus nutjob. There's always in the law [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=601.12s)]
*  In the law right there's always ambiguity and and we don't know how any of these judges or justices will rule when you add in [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=606.0s)]
*  The overlay of politics becomes more complicated. I think there's two important things here one you've illuminated which is super important [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=612.48s)]
*  Which is the actual facts if those facts are true [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=618.88s)]
*  You'd have to make it akin to [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=622.5600000000001s)]
*  The president striking the hooties [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=625.44s)]
*  No federal judge is going to is going to say i'm adjoining the president from striking the hooties [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=627.6800000000001s)]
*  Because this is for most Americans and and as a practical matter [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=633.84s)]
*  It's every bit as urgent to war in some ways more urgent because it's right here at home [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=637.84s)]
*  Than the president trying to you know, clear up the shipping lanes in the middle east [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=642.88s)]
*  So number one the facts matter and if those facts are close to true [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=646.96s)]
*  He should be unshackled to do this and these district court judges [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=651.36s)]
*  I think should show some humility about what they're interfering with and and stop acting like this isn't urgent number two as someone who's had [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=654.8s)]
*  Who had federal litigation that lasted 20 years? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=662.48s)]
*  I know full well how slow the wheels of justice grind in this case [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=666.24s)]
*  I urge every district court judge every appellate judge every supreme court justice [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=670.4000000000001s)]
*  To think about these cases and not treat them all like they're on the same conveyor belt of slow molasses moving [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=675.6s)]
*  This one should get expedited and ruled on so the president can deal with not just fulfilling a campaign promise [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=682.4000000000001s)]
*  But dealing with something that's threatening the life and liberty and property of americans, which is yes akin to a war [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=689.84s)]
*  Here's [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=697.92s)]
*  Here's how the dc circuit court of appeals saw it dan [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=698.96s)]
*  They said we understand that the government is arguing that we've had these unwanted [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=703.68s)]
*  Illegals come into the country unlawfully and you're calling it an invasion or an incursion, but the court said [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=709.66s)]
*  Those terms as used in this statute must be considered in their military sense now already as [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=718.1600000000001s)]
*  As a lawyer i'm thinking okay. That's fine. Who has the ultimate say on [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=724.88s)]
*  Military calls. It's the commander in chief. It's not judge boasberg and it's it's not even the u.s [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  Supreme court and if you read the terms of the alien enemies act [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=734.6400000000001s)]
*  It specifically says that I mean the supreme court's already said we don't have jurisdiction to review commander in chief calls under this but [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=738.24s)]
*  Under very limited circumstances they can review a couple of pieces of it. So in any event [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=744.4799999999999s)]
*  That's what they said. First of all, those terms invaded or encourage incursion has to be considered in the military sense [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=750.0s)]
*  And then they go on to say [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=756.56s)]
*  uh, okay [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=758.4799999999999s)]
*  These words in the statute [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=760.0s)]
*  Must be read to mean quote a hostile encroachment by a nation state [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=762.4799999999999s)]
*  And concluded that these conditions do not exist because we haven't had a hostile encroachment by a nation state now [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  If this stuff about trend to aragua is true [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=774.88s)]
*  That's a very different story [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=778.0s)]
*  And judge boasberg had no right to shut down the commander in chief's call on this [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=780.88s)]
*  Just from just with his pen. He hasn't had an evidentiary hearing at all [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=788.0s)]
*  He shut it down saying I believe they're going to win [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=793.28s)]
*  And the dc circuit court said yeah us too [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=796.72s)]
*  And now if the supreme court doesn't step in this whole policy could be shut down even though the venezuelans [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=800.24s)]
*  Really may be trying to send an incursion into the united states because judge boasberg thinks he knows better [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=805.92s)]
*  Look democrats should not ever be on the side of criminals, uh who are illegal immigrants [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=814.56s)]
*  And I think the issue of immigration has bedeviled the party now for the last you know, eight or nine years [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=820.16s)]
*  And I think to shawn's point we have been on the wrong side of common sense issues [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=826.4s)]
*  The last couple months and so I think the party's probably best [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=831.36s)]
*  Path here is to support the crackdown on criminal illegal immigrants [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=835.76s)]
*  And just say look the justice system should work this out. We have rules and processes in place [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=841.04s)]
*  You know, let's let it work its way [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=846.72s)]
*  But not try to kind of like spike the football and look like we are on the side of protecting [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=849.36s)]
*  Criminal illegal immigrants it is in everyone's interest to get them off the streets to mark's point [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=856.4s)]
*  Poll after poll, you know here where I live in new york city down in dc. They had the big arrest earlier this week [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=862.8000000000001s)]
*  Ms 13 has been terrorizing parts of dc where a lot of democrats live for the last 10 years [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=868.24s)]
*  And so where they're doing this we should applaud trump's efforts to try to clean up the streets and make america safer [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=874.0799999999999s)]
*  Megan if I can real quick, this is a a win-win politically for president trump [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=882.3199999999999s)]
*  If the supreme court which which I believe it will rule in his favor for all the reasons that you [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=887.12s)]
*  Uh kind of enumerated there then it's a political win if by chance the court [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=892.7199999999999s)]
*  At the highest level rules against him [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=898.0s)]
*  I think at least on on the maga base side and I think for a lot of independents [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=900.4s)]
*  After the four years that we were gaslit and told that there was no problem with with [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=904.64s)]
*  Immigration that the border was sealed that criminals weren't coming in [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=909.34s)]
*  They'll give president trump credit for fighting and and so I you know this to him is a perfect issue because there is no downside [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=913.6s)]
*  There's a downside for the country if the court rules against us god forbid they make us bring criminals back into the country [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=921.04s)]
*  But at the end of the day, I think this is one of those ones where you if you're president trump leading this [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=927.12s)]
*  To dan's point you have you've put democrats in a trap [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=932.4799999999999s)]
*  They either have to side with you [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=936.0799999999999s)]
*  or with the criminals [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=938.24s)]
*  Yeah with the worst of the worst at least in some cases the um [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=940.4799999999999s)]
*  The trump administration is asking for an urgent review at the u.s supreme court [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=944.9599999999999s)]
*  And my understanding is though i'm gonna have to go have to go back and check this but my understanding is it's potential [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=950.24s)]
*  It's potentially the case that chief justice john roberts will be able to grant that [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=956.0s)]
*  I know he can either at least grant them urgent review [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=961.04s)]
*  My only question is whether he can actually [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=964.24s)]
*  Without the support of uh at least four justices in this circumstance [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  Reverse [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=971.6800000000001s)]
*  the the temporary restraining order being blocked anyway, i'll find out [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=973.04s)]
*  But this is getting hotter of this whole case and now it's going up to the big boys and girls who actually will [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=977.6800000000001s)]
*  Have the final say and one of the reasons why that's good is because i've made this point on this case before [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=984.4799999999999s)]
*  but the supreme court's more aware than anyone more aware than anyone mark that [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=992.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't have police power [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=998.2399999999999s)]
*  And that the only thing that gets us to comply with their rulings [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1000.4s)]
*  Is our general respect for the rule of law? [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1004.88s)]
*  for one another [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1007.68s)]
*  For any this sort of implicit agreement we have to live as non-barbarians in a country where [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1009.36s)]
*  We've agreed that there's this [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1015.36s)]
*  through line [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1017.44s)]
*  that will [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1019.28s)]
*  Keep us all within a certain bounds of behavior [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1020.64s)]
*  And um, the supreme court has the ultimate authority on what the law is [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1023.84s)]
*  And the supreme court knows however [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1027.76s)]
*  John roberts above all knows if he hands down are ruling [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1030.48s)]
*  Telling the commander in chief that the nine men and women in black robes have the final say [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1035.92s)]
*  over [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1042.96s)]
*  What is perceived as a military threat? [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1044.24s)]
*  Unleashed on us by a foreign government [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1047.1200000000001s)]
*  He's on the thinnest of possible ice and he's so obsessed with the court. I just can't see him wanting to do it [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1050.16s)]
*  Well, he's an interesting figure right because he does vote sometimes against republican presidents including this one [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1059.76s)]
*  Uh, he does care about the integrity of the court the reputation of the court the statement he put out a few days ago [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1065.6000000000001s)]
*  uh [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1071.2s)]
*  In reaction to the president calling for impeachment of judges whose rulings he didn't like [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1072.88s)]
*  Testifies to his willingness to play in the real world and not just in the rarefied earth [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1077.26s)]
*  Air of the high court [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1083.04s)]
*  I think that they're going to rule some against the president in some form and they're going to be some that are result oriented [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1084.32s)]
*  They don't they don't all rule on the merits sad to say I think in this case that in the ones [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1089.92s)]
*  Uh that are comparable as you suggested as has been mentioned deference the commander in chief on this stuff something where there's clearly popular will [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  You can find that you don't need you don't need to look outside of the walls the constitution to find that [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1103.44s)]
*  And I agree with sean they'll probably vote with the president on this one [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1108.16s)]
*  But roberts has got to expedite these things. It doesn't make any sense for america to not expedite them [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1110.88s)]
*  These should be on the fastest of tracks. They should be on a track like bush v gore [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1117.2s)]
*  Not treated at all like normal cases because it's a campaign promise and it's it's happening now [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1122.08s)]
*  This is not some abstract thing. It's happening now. So I wish you were I wish you would expect them and then [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1128.0s)]
*  However, the court rules. I hope the president does what he said several times. He'll do which is adhere to the rulings of the court [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1133.44s)]
*  I think he will I actually do I think he will I think he understands [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1140.6399999999999s)]
*  I agree blowing off the supreme court is and that that really is a true constitutional crisis. Um [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1144.08s)]
*  We can't have more [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1149.52s)]
*  Lake and riley's while we wait this out john roberts controversial though [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1151.28s)]
*  He is especially with righties who wanted somebody who was more like a thomas or an alito [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1155.2s)]
*  He's a good man [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1159.92s)]
*  And he is going to understand the danger [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1161.36s)]
*  Of leaving little kids out there getting molested by these rapists. That's that is happening with these gang members and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1164.3999999999999s)]
*  Young women and men being murdered by them [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1172.0s)]
*  I mean every week we have a story so [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1175.36s)]
*  Time is of the essence. It's long overdue. Thanks to joe biden and trump is trying to clean up a mess [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1178.08s)]
*  That was not of his own making. I just don't see john roberts wanting the supreme court [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1184.08s)]
*  To be the thing that stops him. I we'll see what we'll know better after we hear from them and [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1189.6s)]
*  Uh, if we get an oral argument after that, okay [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1195.1999999999998s)]
*  Let's well, I want to get to elon musk and what happened last night because it was such good stuff [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1198.32s)]
*  But before we go there can we just spend a minute on something else trump did yesterday? [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1202.32s)]
*  Which I think is awesome and not getting enough attention [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1206.6399999999999s)]
*  We got an executive order [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1210.3999999999999s)]
*  That will pull wokeness dei and radical [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1213.36s)]
*  You know race essentialism and gender ideology out of the federal museums including most specifically the smithsonian [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1218.72s)]
*  Uh the zoo he he mentioned and also [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1227.52s)]
*  He's directed jd vance to restore [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1231.12s)]
*  The national monuments and statues [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1233.6799999999998s)]
*  that fell [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1237.12s)]
*  Post george floyd meaning they were ripped down by protesters [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1238.4799999999998s)]
*  Not all necessarily but he wants him to take a look at this. I mean it wasn't all [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1243.12s)]
*  You know people who are pro-slavery or who were armies in the confederate [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1248.6399999999999s)]
*  Army or the generals in the confederate army sean that we tore down we the country [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1253.4399999999998s)]
*  christopher columbus [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1259.9199999999998s)]
*  Statues thomas jefferson statues george washington statues ulysses s grant francis scott key [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1261.36s)]
*  Like you didn't have to be all that controversial for these things to get torn down [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1268.4799999999998s)]
*  And so trump is actually going to take a look because for example at this women's museum [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1272.8s)]
*  Um that's being built [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1277.28s)]
*  He says specifically they were about to put [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1280.1599999999999s)]
*  Trans women meaning men posing as women and honors to them in this thing of trump is stopping it in its tracks [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1282.54s)]
*  Well, look obviously this was a big issue in the election dan referenced it earlier [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1288.8s)]
*  Later before I mean the wokeism the the pendulum swung way way way too far [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1292.96s)]
*  And I think what trump is doing is resetting that this is again where he can get some great wins on these things through executive order [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1297.4399999999998s)]
*  That while he waits for reconciliation some of the big policy issues to come in [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1304.6399999999999s)]
*  Really kind of score points with the american people resetting the culture issues that swung too far and so going through the museums [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1309.04s)]
*  Going through the museums resetting these things rebuilding these statues and the funny thing is it's been probably eight or nine months since I see [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1316.08s)]
*  Saw any any inside polling on this but even when it comes to confederate statues and renaming things like fort brag [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1322.8799999999999s)]
*  Uh, those were extremely popular. It didn't mean that anybody was a [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1329.76s)]
*  Confederate or racist or anything like that. I just I think there's an aspect of not whitewashing history that was important [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1333.82s)]
*  So there's this kind of covers a lot of ground that I think he's on solid ground [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1339.4399999999998s)]
*  With the base and and probably the majority of americans regardless of party [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1344.1599999999999s)]
*  What he's doing dan is he's actually having jd vance take a look at the smithsonian and the zoo, etc [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1349.04s)]
*  And he's having doug bergam as secretary of the interior take a look at public monuments memorials statues markers and similar properties [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1353.6799999999998s)]
*  That have been removed or changed. He says to perpetuate a false reconstruction of american history [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1361.52s)]
*  Etc. He can't go after like state monuments. He can't go after [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1367.58s)]
*  You know the museum of natural history had teddie roosevelt out there [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1372.16s)]
*  He got torn down because there was a native american near him. I like whatever [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1376.08s)]
*  There's just been a lot of tearing down. He can't if it's a local thing. He doesn't have jurisdiction but the [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1381.12s)]
*  The federal land stuff and federal monuments he does here a couple of examples [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1386.56s)]
*  On what he's concerned about in the smithsonian american art museum [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1391.92s)]
*  There's an exhibit that said quote societies including the u.s [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1396.56s)]
*  Have used race to establish and maintain systems of power privilege and disenfranchisement by [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1399.52s)]
*  In another national museum of african-american history and culture [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1406.16s)]
*  Proclaimed that hard work individualism and the nuclear family are aspects of white culture [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1409.5s)]
*  Bye and then as I told you the women's history [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1416.24s)]
*  museum soon to [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1420.6200000000001s)]
*  Soon soon it will be forthcoming plan to feature female [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1422.54s)]
*  Athletes including male athletes who claim to be female [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1427.42s)]
*  Which is not a thing. It's not real and it's not recognized by the trump administration. So what do you think? I mean [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1432.72s)]
*  Here's the interesting thing. It's going to happen trump will sanitize these organizations of all this [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1439.04s)]
*  And then we're going to be in an interesting position four years from now if a democrat were to win the presidency [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1444.08s)]
*  Because I think this stuff will be very popular to get rid of this nonsense to put back up the non-controversial [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1449.1200000000001s)]
*  Statues george washington among them and whenever trump does something I guess with an eo dan [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1454.48s)]
*  I've been asking myself would the democrats really have the nerve? [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1460.6599999999999s)]
*  To tear back down george washington to shove back in the race essentialism at the smithsonian the trigger warnings on the national archives [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1464.74s)]
*  That were all over the electronic database about our declaration of independent like what do you think? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1472.98s)]
*  I [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1479.3000000000002s)]
*  I certainly hope that no democrat would talk about doing that. I mean as they rule [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1480.8200000000002s)]
*  This is mostly one of those 80 20 issues, you know james carville said last summer [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1486.18s)]
*  Or I think it was maybe a few years ago that sometimes democrats sound like they're talking at the harvard faculty lounge [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1490.8200000000002s)]
*  And not like a real person in the real world, you know on the streets of any town usa [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1496.26s)]
*  I think where trump does stuff like, you know, put george washington back on an [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1501.8600000000001s)]
*  You know military base or something like that there is general support for it [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1506.5800000000002s)]
*  I think when he does something like eliminate the you know, recognizing the tuskegee airmen at the pentagon [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1511.78s)]
*  I think sometimes people will say hey, it's a little too far and this is like small and petty [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1519.06s)]
*  And so I think generally speaking though [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1523.78s)]
*  Look, sean said it this was a huge issue in the election the country kind of voted pretty overwhelmingly on this front [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1526.3400000000001s)]
*  I think he enjoys broad support [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1533.3s)]
*  And look, I don't know how much you remember. I think was a year and a half ago or two years ago [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1535.62s)]
*  The san francisco school board several members were voted out in a in a like recall election [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1539.94s)]
*  Because the people of san francisco parents of who lived in downtown were upset that the school board meetings during covid [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1547.3799999999999s)]
*  Were focused on renaming the schools in these kind of dei, you know neutral names [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1554.8999999999999s)]
*  And not reopening the schools for their kids to go back to [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1560.8999999999999s)]
*  And so the history of democrats focusing on issues that aren't [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1564.5s)]
*  You know important to the average american per se is part of what has got us in the hole that we've dug [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1568.5800000000002s)]
*  And so to get out I think we are best to focus on real issues that impact the real lives of real americans [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1575.06s)]
*  And not go back to trying to relitigate dei. What do you know? [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1581.7s)]
*  Tim walsh has a bone to pick with you my friend [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1586.3400000000001s)]
*  He was out there campaigning with beto or aurora [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1590.18s)]
*  Okay, why I don't but he was out there having a town hall with beto and [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1593.6200000000001s)]
*  He sees the the loss in 2024 very differently than you do my friend. Here he is [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1598.18s)]
*  That our strength is our diversity [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1604.66s)]
*  We've been talking about this for years as a country of immigrants and we let them define the issue on immigration [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1606.82s)]
*  We let them define the issue on dni [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1613.6200000000001s)]
*  Dei and we let them define what woke is [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1616.18s)]
*  We got ourselves in this mess because we weren't bold enough to stand up and say you damn right [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1621.22s)]
*  We're proud of these policies. We're gonna put them in and we're gonna execute them [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1625.94s)]
*  Lean in he's saying lean in to all those messages [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1632.02s)]
*  Sean agreed. Sean says yes, go for it. That's that's how we all feel. I'm a guy. I have his back lean in lean in brother [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1636.74s)]
*  And more jasmine crocket, I think we can all agree except for dan [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1643.46s)]
*  Yeah, I think that look I think most americans I think do applaud [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1647.54s)]
*  efforts to diversify [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1653.1399999999999s)]
*  Like a workforce to have uh to include different people in decision making like I think companies [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1655.1399999999999s)]
*  You know and there's a lot of research that you do get better outcomes [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1661.86s)]
*  If you have, you know different aspects different slices of america at the table [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1665.22s)]
*  I think where there's real objection is on the e the equity the idea that you're going to specify [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1669.9399999999998s)]
*  30 has to be x and 30 has to be y not who's most qualified not who is the best for that position [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1677.3s)]
*  And I think that's where the party kind of just really lost control of this issue [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1685.4599999999998s)]
*  I think if we just say we're proud of having, you know a diverse country. We're proud to try to include people [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1689.62s)]
*  But the most qualified the best person should be hired or get the admissions slot [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1696.9s)]
*  Is probably kind of the middle ground when we think about the future [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1703.38s)]
*  on governor waltz [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1708.42s)]
*  On governor waltz, I didn't understand why he was picked originally [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1711.8600000000001s)]
*  And nothing he's done since he was picked has cleared up my confusion [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1716.18s)]
*  On the question of the of these policies your viewers understand the central role [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1720.74s)]
*  These issues played in the election. I think part of the challenge for the part of the country that still doesn't get it [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1726.42s)]
*  Is the media for the most part still doesn't get it [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1732.66s)]
*  And when you ask about will a democrat change it back [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1735.78s)]
*  Well, if they rename dulles airport steve bannon airport, maybe they would change that back [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1739.3000000000002s)]
*  But most of these things I think will be very difficult to change back because the energy in this country is not [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1745.78s)]
*  With this frog boiling in the water move towards and and a fetishizing race and gender [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1751.7s)]
*  But the energy is for people who say thank goodness for the change and the change happening quickly [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1758.1000000000001s)]
*  The changes in the other direction happen very slowly [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1764.26s)]
*  But they change dramatically over time president trump and the cultural and social forces that are pushing back [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1768.02s)]
*  Are happening quite quickly and I think they're gonna they're gonna move as things things tend to move quickly [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1774.26s)]
*  Tend to move hard and fast and I think it's gonna be very difficult for a democrat not just politically but practically to try to put these things back [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1780.34s)]
*  They they're the republicans and frankly the more centrist democrats who objected to this stuff when it was overwhelming us [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1788.5s)]
*  They were silent about those objections because they were scared right not only has that fright been [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1795.94s)]
*  Eliminated they're emboldened. You know, they voted for trump. He's emboldened all of them. They're ready for this war [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1802.32s)]
*  They now have learned that they're in the majority [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1808.5s)]
*  And that this was a temporary insanity that we went through and that it has to be stopped [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1811.38s)]
*  It's actually extremely dangerous. It's like the whole everything's turned, you know in the past five years been dramatic [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1816.3400000000001s)]
*  So I agree with you. It will not be brought back because the popular will of the people will not allow it [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1821.7s)]
*  now I opened the show talking about elon on with brett bear and [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1827.6200000000001s)]
*  some members of the doge team last night and [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1831.94s)]
*  You know, I I did wonder in watching it why didn't we see this earlier these guys are amazing [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1835.0600000000002s)]
*  Like this is exactly we should all be on our hands and knees at night [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1841.6200000000001s)]
*  Thanking god that men and I presume there are women too. They weren't on the set last night are [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1845.8600000000001s)]
*  willing [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1852.02s)]
*  To take time off from their real jobs and real lives and do this for us [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1852.98s)]
*  They were all they really just public servants. Go ahead [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1857.78s)]
*  Public servants go ahead sean but to your point the caliber of these people when he was talking about when brett bear was telling him [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1861.1399999999999s)]
*  So you co-founded uh airbnb. You're the cfo of morgan stanley these the credentials of these people [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1868.02s)]
*  We talked about this a little on the morning meeting this morning that it was the illumination of of just the it wasn't like [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1875.3799999999999s)]
*  You know finding some buried treasure the guy was like, yeah [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1882.1s)]
*  We found out that the department of hhs has 40 cfos [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1884.98s)]
*  40 cf i mean 40 cios chief information officer [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1889.14s)]
*  There are 4.3 4.6 million government credit cards and 2.1 million employees [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1892.5800000000002s)]
*  There's obvious things that are like that doesn't make sense. That doesn't compute 8 000 [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1899.22s)]
*  American federal workers can retire in a given month [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1904.74s)]
*  Because that's all the system can handle because it has to take a manila envelope going down a mine [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1908.26s)]
*  A mine [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1914.74s)]
*  That's how many envelopes can go down in a month. That's insane and the idea that they were talking about utilizing [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1916.1s)]
*  common sense [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1924.08s)]
*  technology reforms efficiencies [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1925.76s)]
*  To allow the government to run better and even elon when it came to social security made it very clear [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1928.74s)]
*  that what 40 of the people who call the [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1935.22s)]
*  Social security hotlines were fraudsters trying to steal the money [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1938.82s)]
*  Of american retirees and what they're trying to do is put processes in place to protect the american consumer [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1944.1799999999998s)]
*  From fraud it's something that I I agree with you. I was like where has this been? [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1952.26s)]
*  I wanted to hear this for the last 70 days and I finally I was excited. I was fired up [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1956.58s)]
*  I I hope they do more because I think that the more people hear about not only what's [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1962.42s)]
*  Really goes on in government, but how it's being corrected the more support doge and elon will get [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1968.8999999999999s)]
*  Here's just a little bit. You mentioned this in your last answer of uh, joe [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1974.42s)]
*  Jebiya the airbnb co-founder and doge digital retirement project guy here. He is satin now picture this [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1980.02s)]
*  This this giant cave has 22 000 filing cabinets [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1987.78s)]
*  Stacked ten high to house 400 million pieces of paper [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1991.94s)]
*  Uh, it's a process that started in the 1950s and largely hasn't changed in the last 70 years [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=1996.66s)]
*  And so as you dug into it, we found uh, retirement cases that had so much paper. They had to fit it on a shipping palette [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2002.1s)]
*  So, uh the process takes many months and we're going to make it just many days will it be digitized or how absolutely [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2009.78s)]
*  So this will be an online digital process that will take just a few days at most [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2015.86s)]
*  And I really think you know, it's an injustice [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2019.94s)]
*  to civil servants [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2023.14s)]
*  Who are subjected to these processes that are older than the age of half the people watching your show tonight? [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2025.06s)]
*  So we really believe that the government can have an apple store like experience [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2031.38s)]
*  beautifully designed great user experience modern systems [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2036.5s)]
*  He he said that there were actually at the point where we have to train [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2042.18s)]
*  federal employees [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2046.26s)]
*  On how to retire they have to go through a training [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2048.1s)]
*  It's so embarrassing [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2053.14s)]
*  It is embarrassing I you know mark I like what americans sitting at home is gonna have any reaction to that other than what [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2056.9s)]
*  It's great to have private sector people in in the government, uh who [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2066.18s)]
*  You know my favorite moments was when brett was asking them their motivation for doing it [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2070.42s)]
*  And one of them said he's got four kids and he doesn't want the country to decline for his kids [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2074.34s)]
*  they're an impressive group and [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2080.42s)]
*  You know even democrats most democrats will say yeah, there's inefficiencies the federal government [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2083.06s)]
*  But this is an attempt to to get rid of them [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2087.94s)]
*  Uh, you know we talk about waste [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2090.98s)]
*  Fraud and abuse this is you know, you could call it waste [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2093.3s)]
*  But it's really just inefficiency and it's really not having the will to use the ingenuity of the private sector up until now [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2096.98s)]
*  To try to change these things al gore talked about reinventing government, but that was in the dawn of the digital age [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2103.86s)]
*  There's so much more that can be done now [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2109.86s)]
*  Using digital stuff and this is again as sean said a couple times. This is such an impressive group from the private sector [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2112.34s)]
*  I just hope that they're adhering to guidelines and I just hope that they don't get shackled [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2119.2200000000003s)]
*  They do need to move fast for all the reasons that this plan was launched [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2123.7s)]
*  In my head like the way they were being described by the media [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2128.02s)]
*  It was like I pictured like these dope smoking hacky sack kicking beanie wearing [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2130.66s)]
*  Foggy, uh lunch put them in right put them in tight [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2137.62s)]
*  They see these guys were they wearing crocs or or or burkenstocks in your in your mind. I couldn't get [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2141.54s)]
*  Sandals I never got down below the ankle in picturing them, but I definitely I could smell the aroma [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2147.94s)]
*  I had a perceived smell [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2153.94s)]
*  They're not that at all these are actually really accomplished badass professional guys who are super articulate on top of their game [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2155.38s)]
*  Now i'm sure they sent their best for the brett baer interview [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2163.54s)]
*  There may be guys who better match my description [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2166.58s)]
*  but you know [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2170.34s)]
*  Chief among them was elon with some very interesting facts of his own. Here's one [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2171.7000000000003s)]
*  uh here that [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2177.2200000000003s)]
*  somebody [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2179.46s)]
*  Somebody mentioned but it's not four [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2180.58s)]
*  Uh the sheer amount of waste and fraud in the government it is astonishing it's mind-blowing [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2182.98s)]
*  uh, just uh [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2187.86s)]
*  We routinely encounter wastes of a billion dollars or more [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2189.38s)]
*  casually [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2193.68s)]
*  Uh, you know, for example like the the simple the simple survey, uh, that was uh [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2196.18s)]
*  Uh, literally 10 question survey that you could do with survey monkey cost about ten thousand dollars [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2201.7s)]
*  Uh was uh, the government was being charged almost a billion dollars for that for just the survey a billion dollars [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2206.34s)]
*  For a simple online survey. Do you like the national park and then there appeared to be no feedback loop for what would be done [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2212.82s)]
*  With that survey so the server would just go into nothing. It was like a tank [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2218.1800000000003s)]
*  Casually and you know what the what's so devastating about that shawn is, you know, it's true [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2223.92s)]
*  I know [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2229.54s)]
*  I've been in the military for 26 years in and out of government. I mean [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2230.66s)]
*  It's finally good hearing someone articulate, uh, what what i've known to be the case for for decades [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2234.66s)]
*  Yeah, and just be honest about it that's like the social security thing everybody can understand that too [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2240.34s)]
*  Why are we sending social security checks to people who appear to be? [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2244.42s)]
*  120 or an infant which is what elam was saying. He was like there people are were sending [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2249.38s)]
*  Checks to infants and he was explaining exactly how they do the fraud [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2256.74s)]
*  Someone has a baby and they steal their own child social security number and they use it to get [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2260.9s)]
*  To get some sort of payout from the federal government and they ruin that child's credit because they just don't give a damn [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2268.26s)]
*  Here is steve davis who was called the ceo of doge though. He didn't seem totally comfortable with that label [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2274.7400000000002s)]
*  Speaking to some of that issue in sat 6 [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2282.1800000000003s)]
*  No, the um the amount of issues that were the social security system are enormous as an example. There are over [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2285.1400000000003s)]
*  15 million people that are over the age of 120 [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2292.34s)]
*  That are marked as alive [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2296.04s)]
*  In the social security system and that's an accurate figure. Yeah, correct 15. Correct [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2298.04s)]
*  This has been something that's been identified as a problem again pre-existing problems since 2008 at least [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2302.36s)]
*  From an ig report so there are some great people working at the social security administration [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2308.52s)]
*  Social security administration that found this 2008 and nothing was done [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2313.72s)]
*  And so 15 to 20 million social security numbers that were clearly fraudulent [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2318.04s)]
*  We're floating around [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2322.12s)]
*  That can be used [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2323.72s)]
*  Only for bad intentions. There'd be no way to use those for good intentions [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2325.0s)]
*  And so what one of the things doge team is doing is carefully and very methodically looking at those [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2328.04s)]
*  And making sure that any fraudulent ones are eliminated [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2333.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, that is shocking but also not [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2338.12s)]
*  Um, and this here's my question. I'm going to play one more sought on social security dan, but this question is coming to you on how [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2341.24s)]
*  How are the democrats going to object to this everybody knows what a money suck social security is along with medicare [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2347.0s)]
*  Slash medicaid. We all know that we all know we're not going to make a lot of progress if any [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2353.88s)]
*  On our national debt unless we get honest about what's happening there. Nobody wants us to touch the retirement age. We get it. It's political [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2358.12s)]
*  poison [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2364.68s)]
*  But this stuff this stuff we can do we can do but the democrats are saying no no to doge no to elon [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2365.64s)]
*  He's evil. Here's the second sound bite on social security with a guy named aram [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2373.56s)]
*  Mogadassi he's a doge engineer [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2378.18s)]
*  i'll say [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2381.64s)]
*  the two improvements that we're trying to make social security are [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2382.84s)]
*  Um helping people that legitimately get benefits protect them from fraud [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2385.8s)]
*  That they experience every day on a routine basis [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2391.0s)]
*  and [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2393.96s)]
*  Also make the experience better. Um, and i'll give you one example is at social security [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2394.92s)]
*  One of the first things we learned is that they get phone calls every day of people trying to change direct deposit information [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2401.0s)]
*  So when you want to change your bank account, you can call social security [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2407.48s)]
*  We learned 40 of the phone calls that they get are from fraudsters [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2411.64s)]
*  40 that's right [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2415.88s)]
*  Almost half [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2418.04s)]
*  Yes, and and they steal people's social security is what happens is they call in they say they claim to be a retiree [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2419.16s)]
*  Um, then they they and they convince the post the social security person on the phone to change the where the where the money's flowing [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2427.4s)]
*  It actually goes to some fraudster [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2434.6800000000003s)]
*  In 67 days they figured all of this out dan, why would the democrats stand in the way of these fixes? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2438.76s)]
*  So I think the important thing for the party is they need to split what is common sense from what is questionable [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2445.48s)]
*  I think what they're talking about here and I actually saw this morning too [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2451.48s)]
*  They're talking about trying to upgrade the social security software and computer systems, which are literally decades old [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2454.7599999999998s)]
*  Just because they haven't received the funding they want to migrate it to a new platform [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2461.64s)]
*  Where they're trying to do stuff like stop fraud i ran government relations for hnr block [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2465.72s)]
*  And I know the a lot about the irs and and fraud and they're absolutely right [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2470.3599999999997s)]
*  It's the russian mob. It's all sorts of people who try to steal your social security [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2475.0s)]
*  File returns, you know falsely before you do and get your refund and but by the time you realize what happened, it's too late [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2480.2s)]
*  Where they're trying to do that. We should say that is good [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2487.72s)]
*  It will also give us credibility with the public for when we say time out this might be objectionable [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2492.04s)]
*  And one of those things is I know we all say [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2498.12s)]
*  Okay, cutting phone service and making you have to come in make sense to try to deal with fraud [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2501.16s)]
*  Sure, if I live in new york city [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2507.24s)]
*  I can walk down to the social security administration or take the subway or a bus [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2508.44s)]
*  In lots of parts of this country it is hundreds of miles to reach it and the elderly it's hard [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2512.68s)]
*  And some of them don't drive they have medical issues that makes movement challenging [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2519.08s)]
*  And so when democrats say wait a second you need to offer those telephone services people need [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2524.44s)]
*  There has to be a way for them to verify and get through [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2530.2s)]
*  That is where I think the public will say yeah, okay. All right [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2533.9599999999996s)]
*  But if all we do is always scream no and everything [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2537.0s)]
*  It's a huge problem and I actually thought you know, look we're making some headway we democrats with elon's favorabilities coming down [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2540.9199999999996s)]
*  But to your point megan those were real people they were uncomfortable. They looked anxious [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2548.3599999999997s)]
*  There's empathy and sympathy as they talked because they're just regular real people trying to help and that as democrats [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2553.3999999999996s)]
*  You know is a is something that we need to recognize [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2560.12s)]
*  I mean, it's the same party that didn't stand for the little boy who got the badge and became the honorary secret service mate [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2563.4799999999996s)]
*  So I I don't think they're gonna feel for the for the doge agents [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2568.4399999999996s)]
*  But here's why I think mark they're not going to give an inch on doge or elon [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2572.2799999999997s)]
*  NBC news just did a focus group of black men who backed trump and [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2579.3199999999997s)]
*  approve of his presidency [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2585.72s)]
*  And asked how they're feeling [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2587.72s)]
*  And that focus group showed that nearly all of them 10 of the 12 [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2589.7999999999997s)]
*  Still are with trump and staunchly [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2594.6s)]
*  The only concern that some of them raised [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2597.8799999999997s)]
*  Uh [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2602.68s)]
*  Was about doge they said i'm trying to get my numbers they say 10 of the 12 said they approved of trump's early tenure [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2603.8799999999997s)]
*  during his second presidency [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2610.12s)]
*  But only five said they approved of doge's actions [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2612.52s)]
*  Only five said they approved three said they disapproved and the rest of the group they weren't sure [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2616.92s)]
*  So if i'm a democrat who really just wants to win back power [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2623.16s)]
*  I see [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2627.24s)]
*  Something I can exploit here and i'm not sure I want to do anything to give doge credit for anything [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2628.44s)]
*  Even if it would be good for the country [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2633.72s)]
*  Well, except this dan said they need to have credibility [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2636.92s)]
*  I think you know [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2639.16s)]
*  We've all wondered why what we saw last night those very articulate spokespeople for this effort were not out sooner [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2639.88s)]
*  I'd say there are two other things that they've done to hurt their cause and and made it easier [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2647.48s)]
*  For democrats to rally public opinion around some things number one [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2652.28s)]
*  They've not totally been truthful and accurate as musk has acknowledged [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2656.2000000000003s)]
*  About what's being saved? [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2660.6s)]
*  About certain programs are using as examples [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2663.2400000000002s)]
*  And they've not quantified it or qualified it accurately and that's allowed the press which is hostile to doge [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2667.02s)]
*  And those democrats who want to be against it to be against it [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2671.82s)]
*  But the other thing I think they haven't done is they haven't told the stories they haven't humanized it [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2675.82s)]
*  We saw humanization last night with these folks [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2681.1s)]
*  But to say here's to just assert people are having their social security stolen [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2683.7400000000002s)]
*  This has to be on a human level because cuts while popular in the abstract when you start to cut specific programs you run into trouble [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2688.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't think the democratic party has a plan right now [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2695.5s)]
*  They're all over the map about how to deal with this but their job of opposing it would be a lot more challenging [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2698.2200000000003s)]
*  If the administration talked about this in a way that was easier to understand why it's a good thing [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2703.9s)]
*  Not just in the abstract but with some real specifics that can be emotionally [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2708.94s)]
*  Emotionally told in a way that involves great storytelling. I don't know why they haven't done it [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2713.5s)]
*  Yeah, why don't we see the guy who says I tried to retire and it took me six months [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2719.0200000000004s)]
*  True. I wanted to retire and one month took me six months to just get out because of the paperwork [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2722.54s)]
*  We haven't seen those people all over tv [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2727.02s)]
*  Exactly. We we had these guys getting closer and closer to real person stories where you were like, oh yeah [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2729.18s)]
*  Oh god, that would be really annoying. Oh, that sounds so dumb [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2736.06s)]
*  Here's one anthony armstrong [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2739.42s)]
*  Doge opm what does that stand for operating office of personal personal management office of person? [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2742.7s)]
*  Why aren't they all I guess he's over there in particular? [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2748.54s)]
*  Anyway, he's over there at the group that that takes care of all your paperwork if you're a federal government employee [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2751.58s)]
*  And here's what he said sod eight a good example of over staffing would be the irs has got [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2756.94s)]
*  1,400 people who are dedicated to provisioning laptops and cell phones [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2762.8399999999997s)]
*  So if you join the irs you get a laptop and a cell phone you're provisioned [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2767.02s)]
*  So if each of those irs officers or employees [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2770.7s)]
*  Provisioned two employees per day [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2774.94s)]
*  You could provision the entire irs in a little more than a month so 12 times a year [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2777.58s)]
*  It doesn't make any sense [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2782.78s)]
*  Why would you have 1,400 people whose only job it is to give out a laptop and a phone right? [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2783.5s)]
*  The whole irs could be handled once a month so that doesn't that doesn't make any sense and president trump's been very clear [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2787.82s)]
*  It's scalpel not hatchet and that's the way it's it's getting done [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2793.66s)]
*  I mean that sounds so right shawn you've worked for the federal government that sounds so right that you'd have to go through [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2798.54s)]
*  That number of people just whose only job is to do two things give you a laptop and give you a phone [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2805.42s)]
*  Which literally should take even if you consider setting up your password and getting you registered on it [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2811.42s)]
*  At most a half an hour. How does somebody how do we have 1,400 of those in the irs alone? [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2817.34s)]
*  Yeah, well the scary part is is that they're not alone [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2824.2200000000003s)]
*  There's probably 1,400 people who do various other tasks and as a guy who look i'm all about tech support [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2826.78s)]
*  I either i've learned that you just power things on and off and that's that's the extent of my tech support [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2833.34s)]
*  So I I get it. I appreciate that and I welcome it [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2838.54s)]
*  But I think 1,400 is a bit excessive and unfortunately, it's not you know [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2841.42s)]
*  Like I said, you go to hhs and they talk about having 40 chief information officers 40 [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2844.94s)]
*  I mean generally when you're the chief there's only one [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2851.1000000000004s)]
*  But I it just shows you the duplicity that exists [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2854.38s)]
*  um, I think to your point [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2858.38s)]
*  These individuals themselves did them the the effort a huge bonus by going out the examples they gave and then if we can add [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2860.7000000000003s)]
*  in the human element the number of people who [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2868.78s)]
*  You know took a month to retire or who couldn't get a benefit or who had their money stolen [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2872.06s)]
*  We're missing that security of the of the piece. I was thinking about this as you were saying a moment ago [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2877.6600000000003s)]
*  You know the the young gentleman that that was so cool [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2883.1s)]
*  During the state of the union president trump I think did better than any previous president highlighting his policies through those individuals [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2886.7s)]
*  In the gallery, I think they almost need to embark on a very similar policy or a similar effort now [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2893.74s)]
*  Which is to go highlight individuals who've had struggles with the federal government [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2898.62s)]
*  Who haven't been able to retire who were taken advantage of who worked in the government? [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2903.1s)]
*  But there was massive duplicity or etc and start to literally [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2907.1s)]
*  Put faces to these problems [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2911.42s)]
*  Uh because they did and and by the way continue to roll out members of doge [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2913.82s)]
*  Who are finding these things not just the dollar amount in the programs? [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2918.7000000000003s)]
*  But the overall crisis that exists because that's not to mark's point [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2922.3s)]
*  Though those aren't it's not waste or fraud the fact that you can't retire, you know [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2926.38s)]
*  That you can only retire 80 000 people it just doesn't make sense in the military [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2930.86s)]
*  We went to medical record electronic medical records because literally you would have to carry your [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2935.34s)]
*  Bulky medical record around with you wherever you went from assignment to assignment station to station [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2940.86s)]
*  And that's how we handle it for until some genius realized wow [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2946.86s)]
*  We could just digitize this like everyone else and it has made life a lot easier, right? [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2949.58s)]
*  What if we can start doing that within the federal government? It's a win-win for the government. It saves us money [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2955.1s)]
*  It saves us time it cuts down on bureaucracy [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=2960.38s)]

*  Well, it's the the dc circuit is notorious for having a very far left bias [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3092.46s)]
*  and when you look at [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3098.86s)]
*  The people close to some of these judges [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3100.78s)]
*  Who are where are they working? Are they working at these ngos? [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3103.34s)]

*  It sounds like corruption to me [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3111.98s)]
*  I mean not said was one of the judges he's thinking about is almost certainly judge bohsberg [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3116.3s)]
*  Who is the one behind the blocking of trump's effort to deport venice will and suspected gang members? [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3121.5s)]
*  To el salvador back with me now my panel mark halperin sean spicer and dan turrentine of [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3128.46s)]
*  Two-way, okay. Um [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3134.38s)]
*  I did look up the scotus protocol for that appeal and here's how it's going to go down [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3137.58s)]
*  So just for those who weren't with us at the top of the hour [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3142.3s)]
*  The trump administration has appealed the dc circuit court of appeals ruling against him [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3145.1800000000003s)]
*  On his effort to use the alien enemies act to deport [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3150.2200000000003s)]
*  Suspected venice will and gang members out of the united states and place them in an el salvadorian prison [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3154.04s)]
*  The trial court judge was judge bohsberg [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3159.42s)]
*  An obama appointee originally put on the bench by w many years ago, but elevated to the federal bench by obama [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3162.54s)]
*  He has had a leftward bent no question [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3167.98s)]
*  And he's got a wife and a daughter who own work in and run respectively an abortion clinic and reportedly the daughter [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3170.78s)]
*  With this ngo organization that helps illegals and gang members [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3177.82s)]
*  So yeah, I think that's what elon's suggesting is maybe going on there [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3183.02s)]
*  um and now [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3187.5800000000004s)]
*  the trump administration [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3189.5800000000004s)]
*  Just before he came to air has appealed their loss [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3191.34s)]
*  On the temporary restraining order bohsberg put against them to the u.s. Supreme court just before we came to air [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3195.1000000000004s)]
*  They want the high court to lift that temporary restraining order so they can continue deporting [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3200.54s)]
*  These venezuelan illegals and shipping them off to el salvador during the pendency of the litigation [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3206.2200000000003s)]
*  And the I was unclear when we started whether [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3212.7000000000003s)]
*  Justice roberts could do this chief justice alone and I was right. He can do it alone [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3215.98s)]
*  Um, he's the chief justice of the u.s united states [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3220.54s)]
*  And each justice on the court has a region of the country for which he or or she is responsible [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3224.2999999999997s)]
*  And as the chief justice he oversees the dc [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3231.02s)]
*  region which is where this case is coming out of because all these federal government agencies are in [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3233.8199999999997s)]
*  um in dc [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3239.1s)]
*  Anyway, that's where it is [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3240.7s)]
*  And so john roberts if he wants to can grant the relief himself [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3242.2999999999997s)]
*  He could with the stroke of his pen [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3247.42s)]
*  Lift the tro [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3249.7400000000002s)]
*  And say have at it trump and then the case would go back down to judge bohsberg for litigation on the merits [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3251.34s)]
*  You know, they would hash it out. It's not a final adjudication, but it is on the tro [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3256.94s)]
*  It's in a form of relief that he could grant to [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3262.06s)]
*  trump [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3265.58s)]
*  or [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3266.86s)]
*  He could say i'll give you an expedited briefing schedule in front of the united states supreme court at at large [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3267.98s)]
*  And so we'll keep the pedal down but we'll let all nine of us decide [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3274.06s)]
*  Whether you can do this [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3278.7s)]
*  Or he could just deny it and say i'm not dealing with any of this yet and kick it back down [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3280.22s)]
*  Which would be a loss for trump so trump could win with the stroke of roberts pen [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3285.18s)]
*  He could lose with a stroke of a roberts pen or he could get a hearing in front of the all nine justices and [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3289.02s)]
*  Hopefully we'll find out soon which one of those it's going to be okay [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3294.7s)]
*  Elon musk sat across from me in september at the all-in summit [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3299.5s)]
*  And said one of the main reasons he wanted donald trump [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3304.62s)]

*  In his words to launch a rocket than it does to build the rocket [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3322.54s)]
*  and how insane it is and how you know you [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3326.7000000000003s)]
*  You get fined forty thousand dollars for dumping [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3331.66s)]
*  Potable water like water that one could drink you dump it out of the [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3335.1800000000003s)]

*  It's it's potable water. Why is why am I getting fined that like comes out of the sky? [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3345.02s)]
*  Why why if god drops it is there no fine, but but if I drop it [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3349.26s)]
*  I'm getting fined. Well, that's just the rules. That's that's the way. Well, what do you mean? [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3354.46s)]
*  Like i'm trying to get us to mars [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3357.98s)]
*  Why are you hassling me this way like I could my daughter could come by with a little garden, uh [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3359.58s)]

*  Tax refund didn't come it's a nightmare [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3524.54s)]
*  When they wanted to go on medicare advantage [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3527.8199999999997s)]
*  And like upgrade that like when they when anything went wrong with their federal government paperwork [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3530.7s)]
*  They had to correct it [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3535.4199999999996s)]
*  We've all been there calling or dealing with the federal government on any of this stuff. Never mind like your taxes [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3536.3799999999997s)]
*  It's a nightmare [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3542.54s)]
*  So what elon's saying the doge guys are saying and ezra's saying it all has the ring of truth [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3544.3799999999997s)]
*  and I do think like [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3550.06s)]
*  While elon's getting battered and bruised [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3551.74s)]
*  The people are generally going to back this maybe they they feel a little bad about the layoffs of the federal employees [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3554.2999999999997s)]
*  Or maybe they just don't really like elon because he's brash, but they like the cleanup in aisle seven who would like to take that [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3560.06s)]
*  Well, it's even worse than that right? So that just laid out the stupid process and the amount of money we wasted on [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3567.02s)]
*  On broadband and people look at that and say I had my own experience with like some titsy fly in the backyard when they [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3572.7799999999997s)]
*  Wouldn't let me put a shed up, but then they also look and go wait a second [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3577.58s)]
*  Isn't there a thing called starlink? [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3580.7799999999997s)]
*  That you could get for like eight bucks that you don't even need to do all that [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3583.02s)]
*  That right. I mean it's it's worse than even that example that ezra klein was going through [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3587.58s)]
*  That's that's just if you wanted to you know what it takes to lay down broadband and do this [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3592.62s)]
*  But then you go, okay, that's stupid enough as it is, but there's actually an alternative [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3596.7s)]
*  That's costs like no money and that's linking up to starlink getting you internet not having to lay down [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3601.98s)]
*  All that this the mindlessness of everything [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3607.42s)]
*  That the federal government touches is unbelievable and you're right [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3611.9s)]
*  Most people get it and they just need to have it validated. Uh in terms of the absurdity [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3615.98s)]
*  Explain to them. Yes. All right. So, uh, I teased this before we took the break [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3622.14s)]
*  We got into a bit of [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3626.54s)]
*  why elon [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3629.02s)]
*  Is disliked by some you know, he's not afraid to throw a barb on x which he owns [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3631.02s)]
*  You know, he's not he doesn't sound like supreme court [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3637.82s)]
*  Justice john roberts. He does not sound like he doesn't speak the same way he does [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3642.14s)]
*  and um [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3646.3s)]
*  One of the things he did was to call senator mark kelly of arizona a democrat [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3647.42s)]
*  Who's married to gabby giffords and he's the brother of scott kelly both of whom are astronauts [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3651.98s)]
*  scott's amazing by the way came on my show at mvc and told us all about how he was a straight c student [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3657.58s)]
*  Straight c right? Isn't that your first question? Did you get all a's you crushed physics? [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3663.34s)]
*  You know, you were in math ways and a science. No, he was like I was a listless [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3667.9s)]
*  I had no direction and I was a terrible student if you gave an astronaut that's brother scott brother mark also an astronaut [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3671.5s)]
*  And now a democrat senator [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3677.9s)]
*  Elon called him a traitor [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3680.38s)]
*  In the context of ukraine and brett asked him about it and listen to this answer [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3682.6200000000003s)]
*  We should have empathy for the thousands of people that are dying every day in trenches [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3687.6600000000003s)]
*  For no movement in the in the lines [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3692.5400000000004s)]
*  So the borders remain the same for the past two years [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3695.42s)]
*  Thousands of people have died every week [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3698.7000000000003s)]
*  for nothing [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3701.6600000000003s)]
*  for what [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3703.1000000000004s)]
*  um [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3704.3s)]
*  And I I take great great offense at those who [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3705.5s)]
*  Uh at those who [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3711.34s)]
*  Those who put the appearance of goodness over the reality of it [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3715.58s)]
*  Those who virtue signal and say oh we can't give in to russia, but have no solution [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3720.46s)]
*  To stopping thousands of kids dying every day have contempt for such people. I don't want to make that clear. Yeah [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3725.82s)]
*  So you're optimistic because they're virtue signaling [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3731.9s)]
*  And their their lack of a solution [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3735.1800000000003s)]
*  means that kids don't have [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3738.1400000000003s)]
*  A father it means that parents lost a son for what? [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3740.54s)]
*  Nothing [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3747.9s)]
*  Pretty powerful mark kelly [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3751.1s)]
*  Came in his crosshairs because he posted something on x about having just returned from ukraine and how in his view [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3753.9s)]
*  It was very important that we stand by ukraine. He wrote [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3758.7799999999997s)]
*  Um, everyone wants the war to end but any agreement has to protect ukraine's security can't be a giveaway to putin [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3761.42s)]
*  And went on from there [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3766.94s)]
*  I here again. I have to say dan. I think the american public is with elon [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3770.2999999999997s)]
*  I think the american public while they have nothing but empathy in general for ukraine [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3773.98s)]
*  They realize where we are that this thing needs to end [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3778.7s)]
*  And that we can't keep throwing good money after bad as americans [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3781.5s)]
*  Well, I think there's two things here I I think generally speaking [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3786.3799999999997s)]
*  President trump ran on trying to end the war in ukraine [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3789.74s)]
*  And I think you're right even within the democratic party and the bernie sanders kind of base [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3792.22s)]
*  There is a desire to spend you know focus and spend money on problems at home [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3796.54s)]
*  Not necessarily abroad although aspirationally as you say people would like ukraine to be protected [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3801.2599999999998s)]
*  I think where musk gets in trouble is when he makes statements like that [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3807.2599999999998s)]
*  People died because russia tried to invade ukraine and they're trying to defend their homeland [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3811.58s)]
*  Right, so I I I get why they dug trenches and they're doing everything they can to resist a country that's trying to take it over [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3816.62s)]
*  I think when musk does stuff like in the interview say this is a revolution. We're trying to revolutionize things [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3824.22s)]
*  Yeah, the public doesn't necessarily love that language [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3831.58s)]
*  I mean this goes to like joe biden trying to suddenly become fdr, right? [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3834.7s)]
*  That's not what a lot of people signed up for in 2020 [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3838.46s)]
*  And so I think musk to your point is brash. I would never bet against him as a businessman [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3842.22s)]
*  He's unbelievably successful to state the obvious [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3847.8199999999997s)]
*  But he's rough around the edges and I think as he wades more into politics whether it's trolling people on x or kind of [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3851.02s)]
*  forcefully interjecting into politics [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3857.48s)]
*  You get the good but you also get bad that I think you know, you have to be willing to digest [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3860.3s)]
*  But I think his numbers are coming down. He is the wealthiest man in the world with conflicts, you know from here to kingdom come [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3865.26s)]
*  I'm not saying I don't care about that [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3872.86s)]
*  Well, they they I I actually think they do a little bit george soros [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3875.26s)]
*  Well, that's it americans are inherently distrustful of very wealthy people who start getting involved in government and to your point [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3880.3s)]
*  Democrats who have had a lot of them in our corner and we loved it [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3886.76s)]
*  It was damage was done to us on george soros and other things. So I I think again, it's good and bad with elon [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3891.02s)]
*  I want to get to what elon's doing in wisconsin because this is an important [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3898.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh election that's coming on tuesday and you guys are the people to ask about it [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3902.38s)]
*  But before we go to the special elections and what's happening in wisconsin with this judicial election [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3905.58s)]
*  Can we spend a minute on hillary clinton? [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3911.18s)]
*  Hillary [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3915.42s)]
*  clinton [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3916.94s)]
*  Decided to drop an op-ed in the new york times today [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3918.36s)]
*  That's entitled how much dumber will this get? [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3923.1s)]
*  And she uses signal gate and the messaging by pete hexeth and mike walsh and jd vance and tulsi and others on there [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3927.66s)]
*  As the jumping off point to talk about how dumb the trump administration is [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3935.74s)]
*  Uh some highlights [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3940.2999999999997s)]
*  Uh, she calls the trump administration hypocritical dangerous and dumb over this story. It's not the hypocrisy that bothers me [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3942.14s)]
*  It's the stupidity [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3947.98s)]
*  We're all shocked shocked that president trump and his team don't actually care about protecting classified information [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3949.5s)]
*  Or federal record retention laws. I mean, this is so rich given her history [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3956.06s)]
*  But we knew that already this is her just trying to say like I did nothing wrong and my whole controversy was made up [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3961.58s)]
*  No one actually cares about any of that because they're not blaming trump harder and trump allowed this in the first place [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3967.18s)]
*  Which much what's much worse is that top trump administration officials? [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3973.1s)]
*  Put our troops in jeopardy by sharing military plans on a commercial messaging app and unwittingly invited a journalist into the chat [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3977.7400000000002s)]
*  That's dangerous [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3984.78s)]
*  And it's just dumb [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3986.62s)]
*  Okay, I mean [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3989.2599999999998s)]
*  Fine. I really think that hillary clinton should have sat this one out given [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3990.62s)]
*  She's in no position to throw stones. She did this willingly. She had her homebrew server for years an intentional choice [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=3995.18s)]
*  Actually, we do need to stop and take that one for on for like for years an intentional choice [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4003.3399999999997s)]
*  That she's she's trying to be like no one really gave a shit about that. This is far worse this unintentional [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4009.02s)]
*  Mistake that was done by adding in the journalist [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4015.44s)]
*  And yes, they obviously they intentionally chose signal to have the discussion on but we've already heard in recent days mark that this was [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4019.28s)]
*  A means of communication used by the biden administration. I just think [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4026.8s)]
*  She should have had bill write it. She should have had some friend of hers on team blue write it someone other than [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4032.4s)]
*  The person with this brand of problems [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4039.2000000000003s)]
*  Well in arkansas we have a word for it we call it hutzpah [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4042.08s)]
*  um [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4045.6s)]
*  Look it [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4046.8s)]
*  Dan knows hillary clinton better than I do but um, you can hear her voice in that thing doubt that there may have been some ghostwriting help [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4048.32s)]
*  but that's her [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4054.2400000000002s)]
*  and [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4055.76s)]
*  She has the um [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4057.12s)]
*  a rare honor along with kamala harris of losing presidential elections to donald trump [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4059.12s)]
*  and [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4063.92s)]
*  She will never get over it [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4065.2000000000003s)]
*  And [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4067.6s)]
*  I understand why you're saying she shouldn't have been to work right when the righted [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4068.64s)]
*  But it's a pretty good enunciation of the view of tens of millions of people about what's going on [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4072.4s)]
*  And the clintons both clintons, they just love the national town square. They don't want to be away from it [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4077.2s)]
*  I will also say [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4083.7599999999998s)]
*  that she [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4085.3599999999997s)]
*  Has not just because she lost to donald trump but because of her world view she has a a genetic inability [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4087.04s)]
*  To stay off of the uh, the the the stand to contact criticize him [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4094.82s)]
*  It just it's in her craw and she cannot help herself and i'm surprised that she's been relatively low-key [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4100.5s)]
*  Uh in in the first 100 days here because she is I know from talking to her friends [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4107.38s)]
*  She's very engaged on this in a day-to-day, uh capacity [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4113.7s)]
*  Here's here's what really galls me shawn [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4117.780000000001s)]
*  She writes that as secretary of state under obama [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4121.46s)]
*  She used smart power while trump is now using dumb power [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4125.62s)]
*  As secretary of state during the obama administration. I argued for smart power integrating [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4131.139999999999s)]
*  The hard power of our military with the soft power of our diplomacy [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4136.5s)]
*  development assistance [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4142.0s)]
*  economic might [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4144.0s)]
*  And cultural influence none of those tools can do the job alone together [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4145.62s)]
*  They make america a superpower the trump approach is dumb power [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4150.74s)]
*  I believe she's talking about among other things ukraine [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4156.820000000001s)]
*  where [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4160.900000000001s)]
*  she [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4161.9400000000005s)]
*  Was secretary of state when we went over there and to to say we meddled in their election is to under [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4162.900000000001s)]
*  State where we are today as a result of that meddling in part [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4170.34s)]
*  For which she takes no responsibility [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4175.78s)]
*  She just talks about how smart she was and the way she manipulated the world [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4177.299999999999s)]
*  And how dumb trump is who's now again having to clean up a massive? [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4181.299999999999s)]
*  democrat fueled if not made but at least fueled [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4186.48s)]
*  mess that's cost [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4190.419999999999s)]
*  countless numbers of lives [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4192.339999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if she still has that reset button that she handed serguei lavroff, maybe she wants to take a do of [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4195.0599999999995s)]
*  Run this op-ed and get a reset there. I mean, this is the woman who literally brought a [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4202.5s)]
*  Reset button to try to make a joke over our relationship with russia and wants to lecture somebody else about that [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4207.68s)]
*  I I really wouldn't go there [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4214.26s)]
*  Then to go into the classified issue after having kept all of your stuff on an unclassified server [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4216.5s)]
*  wiping it with bleep bleach blit [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4222.98s)]
*  Uh, I I just there are days when you go you might want to sit this one out [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4225.94s)]
*  This was one [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4231.38s)]
*  Wait one quick follow for you on it shawn, then she goes on to say [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4233.139999999999s)]
*  She criticizes him for de-emphasizing the importance [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4236.9s)]
*  of embassies [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4240.9s)]
*  Oh my god [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4243.0599999999995s)]
*  Why would she touch anything having to do with an embassy or a diplomatic facility after bangasi? [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4244.9s)]
*  I just there's a million [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4253.299999999999s)]
*  I I literally feel like she's the one who let someone in her chat that shouldn't have gotten in [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4254.66s)]
*  And wrote that op-ed because that that that that re I know that's where it's like [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4259.0599999999995s)]
*  I wish she could have at least blamed that on somebody and and used the reset button [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4263.94s)]
*  But it's just embarrassing how clueless [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4268.0199999999995s)]
*  And how unself aware she is? [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4271.0599999999995s)]
*  Of her own vulnerabilities that because it's not just that right when she does stuff like this [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4274.099999999999s)]
*  It means the democrats have to answer for it. We have to we get to talk about it [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4279.0599999999995s)]
*  This is one where you literally say i'll write it for you and then hand it off to somebody else or [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4283.0599999999995s)]
*  Just sit this one out or don't send it into the new york times write it for your in your journal [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4288.66s)]
*  Or put it on your unclassified server and keep it for yourself [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4293.22s)]
*  I know remember how she tried to act bored during the bangasi hearings like oh my god [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4296.98s)]
*  I just didn't listen to this nonsense. Well, also I just couldn't say her homebrew server or cell phones were wrong either [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4300.98s)]
*  Go ahead, but but for for for just one thing we got we lost in the conversation about signal gate [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4306.74s)]
*  Was that the president and his team knocked out all of those hoothy targets? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4313.0599999999995s)]
*  No lives were lost targets were hit [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4318.1s)]
*  The obama or the biden administration lost 13 lives coming out of afghanistan [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4321.06s)]
*  She dealt with bangasi if we want to talk about [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4326.820000000001s)]
*  missions and diplomacy and in actions [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4330.34s)]
*  I'll take the trump record over her record over biden's record any day of the week. Yeah, I mean we [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4333.54s)]
*  We lost an ambassador like she now she's just kind of like, oh the embassies. There's a de-emphasis [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4340.34s)]
*  Would you like to have the embassy conversation because we could do that [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4346.280000000001s)]
*  We could definitely get back into it. You purported to be bored about it. I know you like this thing dan [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4348.92s)]
*  How did you like this thing? [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4353.64s)]
*  So I I actually loved it. I will fully admit all the things [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4355.96s)]
*  Yes [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4359.8s)]
*  All the all the things that you guys both said and mark that she may not be necessarily the best messenger for the reasons that you guys [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4360.280000000001s)]
*  All said but I think she fully believes it [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4366.76s)]
*  She she's throwing punches and I think the party has sat around [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4369.96s)]
*  Frozen since trump got elected. They're exhausted. They don't know what to do. They're questioning [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4374.36s)]
*  You know all their strategies and tactics the last four or five years against trump [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4380.6s)]
*  And I think to mark's point she sits there and she's I mean hillary clinton is if nothing else one tough sob [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4384.92s)]
*  And I think she's just like gosh darn it [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4391.64s)]
*  We need to stand up and start saying stuff and i'll do it and look I give her credit [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4393.72s)]
*  I mean, she knows exactly what we're saying are all the words about her [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4398.76s)]
*  And she's not going to be our candidate in 2028 [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4403.16s)]
*  But she is trying to give some some steel to the spine of democrats [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4405.88s)]
*  To just say common sense as we see it stuff and get in the game and start trying to go at him [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4410.599999999999s)]
*  Instead of just sitting around in the fetal position getting rolled [[01:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4417.4s)]
*  Dan, do you think your donors on the dem side or house rank and file house members? [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4421.32s)]
*  We're excited to see that op-ed in the new york times this morning [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4426.28s)]
*  I [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4429.0s)]
*  Think they were probably not excited to see the name [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4430.28s)]
*  There are the reasons that we all just but I think they probably say all right [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4433.56s)]
*  You know she's getting off the sideline like I think and we may get to this [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4437.0s)]
*  This has been the best week for democrats probably since august of last year kind of yeah optimism going into the convention [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4440.2s)]
*  There was less coming out of it, but I think they're like, all right now hillary's in in the game [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4447.88s)]
*  She's one of the few people in the party who's an aircraft carrier who can take the fight to trump with clarity [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4453.0s)]
*  And while the answer is some donors were not happy to see it [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4459.24s)]
*  I know some were not because it was her but because as dan said they need someone to enunciate the contrast [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4463.4800000000005s)]
*  You know bill clinton could do it. You know barack obama could do it. They won't [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4470.76s)]
*  They won't because they're former presidents, but she will and so she's not an imperfect messenger, obviously [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4475.4800000000005s)]
*  But but go read it and take the name off of it and you'll see a lot of stuff [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4481.16s)]
*  As dan said democrats want to hear somebody saying [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4485.32s)]
*  Oh, I I want to ask you a follow-up on signal gate [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4488.4400000000005s)]
*  But you mentioned that they won't do it because they're former presidents and you know, there's this I guess [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4491.16s)]
*  unwritten rule or at least used to be about unwritten about about [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4496.26s)]
*  sitting presidents [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4500.92s)]
*  Former presidents trashing the sitting president and this is what joey bayhar said about it on thursday [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4503.320000000001s)]
*  They also have a tendency to blame the biden administration [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4510.52s)]
*  It's like move on that ship has sailed I never remember in my lifetime a sitting president trashing a previous president [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4514.06s)]
*  I've never heard that before you never heard, you know, Ronald reagan didn't do it. They're they're same model [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4520.78s)]
*  It just quickly just found in like a 30 second google search here's joe biden as president [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4528.22s)]
*  What in your view constitutes the primary threat to freedom and democracy at home? [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4535.5s)]
*  Donald trump donald trump and the maggot republicans [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4540.459999999999s)]
*  Represent an extremism that threatens the very foundations of our republic. Donald trump has no character [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4544.139999999999s)]
*  The only garbage I see floating out there is his supporters. There's one more thing trump and his republican friends want to do [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4551.419999999999s)]
*  These are the kind of guys you like to smack in the ass [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4557.419999999999s)]
*  Okay [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4562.299999999999s)]
*  So yeah, some of that was when trump had declared but I could have given you 20 other examples of trump not running [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4563.82s)]
*  Of him doing there's no there's no rule anymore [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4569.74s)]
*  The only rule is there's no rules. It's just like the same as the end of greece when danny zucco and kinecky [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4572.62s)]
*  We're doing the drag race. The rule is there ain't no rules. That's where we are in today's day and age back to signal gate [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4579.26s)]
*  Mark what is happening? [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4586.14s)]
*  With the weirdness between what seems to be like team hickseth and team walsh like are these two guys? [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4588.54s)]
*  Maneuvering against each other to see like if one of us has to go down. It's going to be you what's happening? [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4595.82s)]
*  um, there's certainly people in their orbit who are interested in of [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4604.219999999999s)]
*  Moving the spotlight if necessary to save their friend or their boss [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4609.66s)]
*  I don't know about between the two of them. I think [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4613.9s)]
*  My my belief is that everyone on that chain [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4616.86s)]
*  There's some of the responsibility because they should have said [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4620.46s)]
*  Whoa, this conversation shouldn't be here if there's two primary [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4623.82s)]
*  Mistakes involved errors of judgment beyond the the shared error of all of them [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4627.98s)]
*  One is allowing jeffrey goldberg on the chain still don't know how it happened [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4632.94s)]
*  But the national security advisor is taking the blame for that and for many that's the big sin [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4636.46s)]
*  And so walsh is taking the blame there, but the other is the sharing of information that almost everybody I know [[01:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4641.74s)]
*  Including shawn because we've talked about it on two-way doesn't believe should have been on signal [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4647.74s)]
*  And that falls primarily on the secretary of defense. So they both have primary responsibility for one of the things that went wrong [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4652.54s)]
*  Many people have noticed that the president has been more critical of waltz than he has [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4659.660000000001s)]
*  Of of hegseth and and there've been some reporting that for a couple hours a couple days at least [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4663.660000000001s)]
*  Uh, there was some chance the national security advisor would go so [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4669.5s)]
*  Those guys are both [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4672.780000000001s)]
*  Um ferocious competitors, uh, they both want to stay in their jobs [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4674.780000000001s)]
*  One of them has got more personal closest to the president which is hegseth [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4679.0199999999995s)]
*  But it appears they're both fine for now and in the last day [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4683.26s)]
*  The tensions that i've heard between their camps have tamped down appreciably as it looked like they kind of teamed up to move the thing [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4687.0199999999995s)]
*  Off the table [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4693.9s)]
*  All right shawn same question to you. What do you see happening there? [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4695.179999999999s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. Well, this is my big tell [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4698.86s)]
*  I said this this morning. It's the manifest to greenland is important today [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4701.74s)]
*  More importantly is the manifest returning from jd [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4707.1s)]
*  Right, so pay attention to the manifest on the flight home [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4710.78s)]
*  Does anybody become the special envoy to greenland and just get stuck in nook? [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4714.22s)]
*  You know, I mean, I hope it's not a chump [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4718.7s)]
*  No, she's fine. I think everybody loves her. She she bought she bought a round trip to take you [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4721.66s)]
*  But but I do wonder if somebody ends up hanging around the commissary too long there at the at the base [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4727.26s)]
*  Um, can you can you speak to what he was saying about you know? [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4732.38s)]
*  The biggest question is and i've heard this too from trump [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4736.22s)]
*  How did jeffrey goldberg get into mike walsh's phone something mike is denying, but we all know [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4739.34s)]
*  He was in there in one way shape or form or this mistake could not have happened [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4745.0199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so there's two things not all sins are created equal and I think in donald trump's eyes right now the sin of allowing jeffrey goldberg [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4749.98s)]
*  Into that conversation is greater than p hick seth probably going beyond what he should sensitivity wise on that chain, right? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4756.0599999999995s)]
*  And the mission was a success. So I think trump looks at it and says who am I more pissed at? [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4764.219999999999s)]
*  Uh somebody who allowed this jeffrey goldberg guy into the thing who obviously is [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4770.0599999999995s)]
*  Someone of dubious character to begin with uh, and obviously a never suffers and losers smear [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4775.82s)]
*  I I think megan the problem that a lot of people are having is and I said this on the [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4781.5s)]
*  Jeffrey goldberg is in my phone. I had to call and yell at him during the transition because of a horrible horrible story [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4787.339999999999s)]
*  When I met him the first time that his reporter wrote that I called to chastise him about so like it's not [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4793.98s)]
*  I think if mike waltz said hey, yeah [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4799.74s)]
*  He was in my phone book because one time he was writing a profile on blah blah blah [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4801.179999999999s)]
*  No one I mean, I have a lot of people in my phone that good and bad [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4806.0599999999995s)]
*  But because over 30 years you that's I mean, I actually have mark halpern's contact information going back like 18 jobs [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4810.379999999999s)]
*  Time that I can do mark's bio because I don't delete anything [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4817.58s)]
*  But that's another story the point is that like it wasn't if it doesn't jamison grier might have been the who's the u.s [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4821.74s)]
*  Trade rep. It's jg. Maybe that's who why would they be putting a u.s. Trade rep on such a conversation? [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4828.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean that's that's again. That's a whole separate thing [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4834.46s)]
*  But my point is it's an honest mistake instead of just saying hey [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4837.26s)]
*  Look the guy was in my phone book because I had to yell at him eight years ago or he did who cared? [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4840.860000000001s)]
*  Instead of trying to do this. I don't know how he got in my phone book [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4845.42s)]
*  I I think that that's gonna that could be the bigger problem because he's opened himself up to [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4848.7s)]
*  I I think that we should investigate this. Well at some point. I don't know enough about tech [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4854.860000000001s)]
*  but you know, maybe there's some way of [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4859.58s)]
*  Finding out the date that a contact entered it entered into your phone book or something like that because there is [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4861.900000000001s)]
*  You don't want to look like joy read like I don't know who made those [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4867.18s)]
*  Anti-lgbtq entries on my blog. I demand an fbi investigation. I agree with you [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4871.4800000000005s)]
*  I don't think it's that controversial to have [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4876.46s)]
*  weird bad [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4879.02s)]
*  Nasty anti-trump reporters or whatever in your context. It's like the nature of all of our industry you deal with [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4880.86s)]
*  People you can't stand you deal with people who can't stand you it's just who change over time [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4888.62s)]
*  I mean you might have met someone 15 years ago [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4894.38s)]
*  I've had people work for me during my six years at the rnc [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4896.3s)]
*  Who I haven't spoken to since because of some of the positions they've taken they're still in my phone book [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4899.9s)]
*  I don't spend time purging it. I don't think that was the big sin [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4904.54s)]
*  And so this to me is going to be the rub if there is something that comes of this [[01:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4907.9800000000005s)]
*  That's going to be a problem because a crisis should die after 48 hours if it's not given oxygen [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4913.5s)]
*  And I think this thing has lasted way too long [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4918.78s)]
*  If I don't think they should have said it's not war plans. I just don't think that was worth a worthwhile argument [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4921.9800000000005s)]
*  Well, I I should have said jeffrey goldberg wasn't in mike. I I just think all of it. They should have said [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4926.94s)]
*  Here's exactly what happened you just I mean the the way you put out a scandal is you say here's everything here's everything [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4932.139999999999s)]
*  And we're gonna you get the defensiveness on the plan though [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4937.66s)]
*  I I will say as somebody who who understands what those terms mean [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4940.86s)]
*  Right, and those are but the average person is really drawing the same distinctions [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4945.259999999999s)]
*  I mean, I get it. I understand why pfeld's unfairly attacked [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4951.259999999999s)]
*  But I just think as a p like pr is something I actually know pretty well [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4955.0199999999995s)]
*  He knows what I know [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4958.86s)]
*  But you also but megan here's the thing you also know the law very well [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4960.3s)]
*  And if I started pontificating and said well, they should have just filed this motion [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4964.06s)]
*  Inside of you as the good lawyer you are you'd say you can't do and I think there's a defensive posture for people [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4968.54s)]
*  In the national security space to say that wasn't a war plan though. Jeffrey Goldberg wouldn't have released the actual [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4974.62s)]
*  I know I know with the with the whatever you want to call those things and the story didn't get better for [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4981.74s)]
*  Pete and mike and everyone when he did that so it's like it's just explain. I'm just saying I'm just saying I get their defensive [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4987.18s)]
*  reflexive [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4995.64s)]
*  Defensive response because you're defending something, you know not to be true. I get why they did it [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=4996.92s)]
*  I know I just like it you have to be smart when it comes to pr [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5003.74s)]
*  Same as you do as a military planner and be able to see three four or five steps ahead [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5007.26s)]
*  So it's going to make you feel better to do this counter-strike, but then then what right? [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5011.58s)]
*  And that's what I bring it up because you're you know [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5016.139999999999s)]
*  We're talking about how we're now in day five of what should have been a 24 to 48 hour scandal [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5018.219999999999s)]
*  I think it's over. I don't think it's I mean the democrats will still continue to try to light the flame [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5023.099999999999s)]
*  Hey, megan. We also you know, one of the things that didn't get much attention someone brought this up [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5027.34s)]
*  I can't I will steal the idea but it wasn't mine is you think about this goldberg knew about this for weeks, right? [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5031.259999999999s)]
*  And he held it until he knew there was a pre-planned [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5037.42s)]
*  Hearing of the intel chiefs on Capitol Hill like he got away with that just think about this [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5041.76s)]
*  He timed the drop of that story until he knew those chiefs were going to be on Capitol Hill [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5047.04s)]
*  I mean you talk about the pr piece of this [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5051.84s)]
*  I will give the atlantic credit for for literally thinking about how to place this story and when to get the maximum effect [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5053.92s)]
*  Well walter kern and matt taibbi were on the other day and they had a really good point. They were like [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5061.12s)]
*  Why would you ever declare that you were on there just think you could have four years of access to the most amazing [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5066.72s)]
*  Communications ever and then at the end of the administration be like here's everything I saw. Oh my god [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5073.74s)]
*  Like I could have been an even better scoop for them. Anyway, I think it's over [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5079.04s)]
*  I just thank god nobody on our side got hurt [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5083.4400000000005s)]
*  The mission went off perfectly and that we should be grateful that it did [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5086.64s)]
*  I guess the trade representative might have been on there because we were striking trade routes and the hoothies therein [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5090.72s)]
*  Okay, next up. We've got to talk about you know on monday [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5096.0s)]
*  All the news was how the democrat party is in shambles. It has its worst approval ratings in years within its itself [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5099.84s)]
*  You know, it's democrats hate hate the party democrats hate their leaders. They have no leader [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5106.88s)]
*  And then we start to see [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5111.6s)]
*  Like last night elise stephaneck [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5113.68s)]
*  Was withdrawn as trump's nominee for un ambassador because he needs her to stay in her seat [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5115.84s)]
*  And then we find out that there was a special election in [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5120.56s)]
*  Pennsylvania in a jurisdiction trump won by double digits that went blue [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5123.34s)]
*  And now we're looking at two in florida where trump won by huge margins that are potentially in trouble [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5129.28s)]
*  So what what's happening? Is this a party that's in trouble or isn't it? That's where we go with the guys right after this [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5135.28s)]
*  As president trump is settling into his new administration one of the top democrats in congress aiming to undermine the trump agenda [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5143.84s)]
*  Is democrat senator dick durbin of illinois and according to our sponsor the electronic payments coalition [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5150.48s)]
*  Senator durbin has a new plan a government takeover of your credit card today [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5156.88s)]
*  Americans have thousands of choices in credit cards [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5162.08s)]
*  But they say senator durbin's plan will result in less competition and less security [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5164.48s)]
*  Which means more risk for your credit and your identity you can learn more for yourself at guardyourcard.org [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5169.28s)]
*  Org and you could consider telling your senators to stop dick durbin's government takeover of your credit card [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5176.259999999999s)]
*  Before it's too late. There's a lot of talk about government debt [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5183.0599999999995s)]
*  But after four years of inflation another real crisis is personal debt [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5186.74s)]
*  Some people are working harder than ever and still drowning in credit card debt and overdue bills, but there is done with debt [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5191.0599999999995s)]

*  What I said before the break. I thought the democrats were imploding and yet elisa's got to [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5246.26s)]
*  Leave the un job so she can hold on to that seat. You've got um, this was a [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5251.94s)]
*  pennsylvania state race [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5257.92s)]
*  That the democrats won but it was a it was a jurisdiction [[01:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5260.820000000001s)]
*  On lancaster county pennsylvania. It was a state senate seat that trump won by 15 points in november [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5266.18s)]
*  and included the more conservative parts of a county that [[01:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5272.900000000001s)]
*  Only one democrat presidential candidate linden johnson [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5276.660000000001s)]
*  Had won since the civil war so that's [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5280.26s)]
*  Dems have to be feeling good about that and then you've got the matt gaits seat [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5283.14s)]
*  And the mike wall seat in florida, which are normally totally solidly red [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5286.82s)]
*  But republicans are worried about those elise stefanik won her seat [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5291.860000000001s)]
*  By 24 points last year and the guy who was running to replace her as the republican on the ticket is up 16 points [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5296.34s)]
*  But still trump said get back down there. At least we can't afford to lose it. So I like what what's happening mark? What's happening? [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5303.14s)]
*  Well don't want to overstate what the trend here because the country the polls say yes the country's thinks [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5310.58s)]
*  People think the country's on the right track [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5317.38s)]
*  President trump is still wielding his power in a pretty dramatic and some ways unprecedented way [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5319.86s)]
*  I think there's three things going on first of all with any president the year after the election [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5324.82s)]
*  You almost always see some sort of bounce back [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5329.46s)]
*  Right the two gubernatorial races the year after the presidential only two [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5332.34s)]
*  competitive races every year [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5336.18s)]
*  Are somewhat competitive at least new jersey and virginia and for years they swung [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5338.26s)]
*  Almost always to the president the party not of the president. So part of it is just it's a year after [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5343.38s)]
*  Second is some of the stuff the president's doing does not seem relevant on the economy to a lot of voters particularly [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5348.740000000001s)]
*  On inflation where the where's the president's focus been on the economy? It's been on tariffs. Most people don't understand that [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5357.9400000000005s)]
*  Some people are worried about them [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5364.58s)]
*  Um, and we see consumer confidence is is a little bit off so or and some polls a lot off [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5366.66s)]
*  So I think I think there's an economic uh gap and you see that in the president's polling [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5372.0199999999995s)]
*  Where his ratings on the economy are lower and that's a big issue for voters [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5377.14s)]
*  and then lastly [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5380.42s)]
*  There's no perfect [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5382.18s)]
*  Off-year election that's going to tell you, you know exactly what's going on nationally [[01:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5383.7s)]
*  But there's no doubt that a factor in these races is when donald trump isn't on the ballot republicans don't do as well [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5387.54s)]
*  He's not on the ballot in these races and democrats finally have a little bit of pep in their step [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5393.54s)]
*  They finally have a feeling of well, we can't beat them in washington [[01:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5398.0199999999995s)]
*  We didn't beat them in the last election [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5401.54s)]
*  But if we win these special elections if we donate money if we volunteer if we get energized [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5403.3s)]
*  We can send a message to everybody that we want to check on trump [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5407.54s)]
*  I think all those things have combined to put republicans back on their heels doesn't mean they're going to lose any of these races [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5410.66s)]
*  Necessarily, although they did as you say lose the one in pennsylvania, but this is a time [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5416.08s)]
*  Uh, we talked about it on the show this our show this morning. It's been the best week [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5421.219999999999s)]
*  We all agree for for democrats since trump got elected [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5424.98s)]
*  And and that adds up to creating an electoral environment that's favorable right now for democrats as compared to the mean [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5428.42s)]
*  Dan scott pressler is the guy who went to pennsylvania moved there for more than a year prior to the vote and [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5436.0199999999995s)]
*  Really was very instrumental in turning it red [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5442.66s)]
*  Um, and he tweeted out i'm gonna be honest with you [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5446.0199999999995s)]
*  Even if you don't want to hear it republicans have been losing special elections all over the country [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5449.0599999999995s)]
*  Even red districts in iowa and pennsylvania [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5454.26s)]
*  Democrats are fired up unless we begin focusing on ground game. We will lose 2025 and 2026 [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5457.38s)]
*  Do you agree? [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5465.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and I think james blair I think it was in an interview with politico the white house political director recently said [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5466.74s)]
*  Like it is a little bit of a problem that our team meaning kind of trump and maga supporters [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5472.34s)]
*  Are pretty kind of happy right now and you're always a little less energized when you feel like everything is being accomplished that you fought so hard for [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5477.299999999999s)]
*  Where angry maga is more effective, right? [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5485.299999999999s)]
*  Whereas conversely democrats are fired up and I think there's two things democrats are fired up about donald trump [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5487.78s)]
*  They've also they're fired up about the kind of uh, incompetence and ineptness of their own leaders [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5494.82s)]
*  And what you're seeing is this like we've had enough and now like we are going to force [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5501.139999999999s)]
*  Action from the bottom up for our own party to get its act together [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5506.5s)]
*  And so on the local level on the grassroots level we can all talk about aoc and bernie sanders their politics are not necessarily [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5510.9800000000005s)]
*  My politics but what they're tapping into what they're showing the party [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5518.02s)]
*  Hey, we can get 30 000 people to show up in a red state. That is hard [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5522.58s)]
*  I was in politics for 20 years the only person who's been able to do it for year after year is donald trump [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5526.660000000001s)]
*  You know obama had like a two-year period where he was like really hot could fill arenas and then it became a grind [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5532.0199999999995s)]
*  Trump is the only one in bernie sanders who can do it [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5537.78s)]
*  And I think that you're seeing you know this week was signal [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5541.139999999999s)]
*  There's a little bit of a ding or self-inflicted error that democrats said, okay, they're human a little bit, right? [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5543.94s)]
*  They were fumbling around like it gave them some confidence [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5549.379999999999s)]
*  And so I think democrats are energized republicans maybe not quite as much [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5553.219999999999s)]
*  And we'll see here I also would not underestimate [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5558.900000000001s)]
*  That what mark said trump got elected on the economy and inflation [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5562.66s)]
*  And he doesn't even talk about those things most of the time most of these press conferences dei [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5567.06s)]
*  Doge with elon musk a lot ukraine [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5572.74s)]
*  It's not on the economy and I think voters are frustrated and you combine that with doge having kind of a little bit of a rickety [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5575.78s)]
*  Uh, you know reputation in polls you see some some [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5583.62s)]
*  Pieces together [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5587.860000000001s)]
*  You know megan the thing is look special elections are special. That's a fact [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5589.46s)]
*  There are no lessons to be learned and one of the things that I learned out of pennsylvania beyond [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5594.34s)]
*  I mean the environment we just talked about there's no question [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5598.900000000001s)]
*  Republicans aren't as fired up as democrats right now, but mechanics matter and candidates matter and in pennsylvania by all estimation [[01:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5601.76s)]
*  The candidate was not very good the mechanics on the ground were horrible [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5609.22s)]
*  That's what worries me about the florida two special elections the first district which is the the the one held, uh [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5612.58s)]
*  Previously by matt gates should be okay. Jimmy patronus has run statewide before and won several times. So he's a good candidate [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5619.22s)]
*  He's got a good fundraising base. He's got people motivated the the sixth district, which is the matt mike waltz seat [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5626.18s)]
*  Uh, which is the the republic's nominees state senator randy fine is not raising the party carried by 30 points [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5632.820000000001s)]
*  30 points, this should be a slam dunk [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5639.78s)]
*  Uh now again, it's special. So maybe he only wins it by 10 or 12, but right now it's dead even [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5642.58s)]
*  There's even one poll that shows the dem up. This should be a huge wake up call [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5648.02s)]
*  The candidates matter the mechanics matter, but that I mean that should still keep it within five or 10 [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5653.22s)]
*  We have a problem scott pressler is absolutely right [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5658.58s)]
*  And that's the thing is that at some point you can you know, those things matter for a few points here and there [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5661.54s)]
*  We got a bigger problem too in terms of keeping the base motivated [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5666.82s)]
*  Well, um, it won't be long until they get angry again. That's that's republicanism. There's always somebody disappointing you [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5670.66s)]
*  Go from that fat and happy to angry in a big hurry [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5679.46s)]
*  Yeah, it's it's easy. Um the wisconsin supreme court race [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5682.5s)]
*  We should spend a moment on spend a moment on too there there [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5686.1s)]
*  I can't believe the amount of messaging I get on a daily basis about this race as somebody lives in connecticut [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5689.0599999999995s)]
*  Like why am I getting this online and everywhere elon's doing his you know [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5694.5s)]
*  You'll get a million dollars if you can show me that you voted [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5699.54s)]
*  You don't have to tell me who you voted for he's doing that thing again [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5702.58s)]
*  Going back out there. Everybody's sounding very alarmist on this thing [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5705.78s)]
*  But the democrat is up and by a lot according to the latest poll [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5709.78s)]
*  Where her name is uh, crawford susan crawford. She's up against brad skimel [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5714.1s)]
*  And it's 50 42 according to the latest poll of likely voters 500 of them, although wisconsin they say is like impossible to poll [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5719.4800000000005s)]
*  So what's going to happen there and why does everyone care so very much? [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5726.4400000000005s)]
*  And is it redistricting that this court is going to have the final say on? [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5731.32s)]
*  Yes, yes, that's the biggest issue redistricting [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5737.08s)]
*  I mean that that's when they're gonna that would be a huge issue that people should care about nationwide [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5740.12s)]
*  Not just the folks in wisconsin a lot of voter id thing a lot of early voting all goes through this [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5744.2s)]
*  We'll go through the state supreme court. So yeah for a lot of reasons people should care about that [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5749.0s)]
*  I think there's no question democrats have the edge going to this is going to be a turnout thing [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5753.48s)]
*  And that's why you're seeing elon don jr others try to make the case tell a town halls personal visits, etc [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5757.08s)]
*  Republicans could do themselves a huge favor [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5763.5599999999995s)]
*  Uh, if they pick up the supreme court seat and I would say that they're not favored to do it [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5766.76s)]
*  But it's definitely one of those things is we head down the stretch that they have every ability to do [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5771.88s)]
*  I can't think of any state [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5776.52s)]
*  Sorry, go ahead mark [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5779.320000000001s)]
*  I can't think of any state [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5780.76s)]
*  Whose supreme state supreme court decisions have been as impactful not just in the state but kind of nationally resonant as wisconsin [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5782.52s)]
*  And like the the the political culture and the states and the u.s senators [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5789.88s)]
*  They are actually purple, right? [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5794.68s)]
*  You can't think of very many states because there aren't very many left who have senators from different parties wisconsin does [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5796.4400000000005s)]
*  ron johnson far right maga tami baldwin pretty far left [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5802.04s)]
*  And you see on that state supreme court the stakes are huge again [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5806.360000000001s)]
*  Wisconsin's probably been supplanted supplanted by pennsylvania as the battleground state, but it's still number two [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5810.900000000001s)]
*  And so the stakes are high in order to not just impact that particular state [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5817.240000000001s)]
*  But the symbolism is what's important to so many to say [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5822.68s)]
*  We're going head to head with all the outside money and the state ground games to see who can win a very contested seat in in [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5826.120000000001s)]
*  Wisconsin we've seen it before with scott walker [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5833.14s)]
*  We've seen it before with the u.s senate race [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5835.64s)]
*  It is high stakes there because of the national resonance of the state and its political culture [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5837.72s)]
*  So dan is what's going to happen? [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5843.72s)]
*  Let's say that if the democrat wins then the democrats control that court [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5845.0s)]
*  And then is it true that that could mean as many as two congressional seats? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5849.0s)]
*  Additional congressional seats for the democrats [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5854.28s)]
*  It could I mean we'll we'll have to see there's going to be a gubernatorial race in wisconsin here in two years in 2028 [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5858.36s)]
*  And um, you know, we'll just have to see kind of how it shakes out. Look what it does do is just give a little [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5865.400000000001s)]
*  You know momentum to the party. We just lost but tammy baldwin did win there [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5872.28s)]
*  I think one of the things that we're really watching for all three of us and megan you probably as well is [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5877.56s)]
*  Elon musk in the fall last year was an asset to donald trump. I I don't think anyone would [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5883.4800000000005s)]
*  Disagree with that [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5890.28s)]
*  He is now going there this weekend. He's put a lot of money into this race [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5891.8s)]
*  He's been very vocal on x and other places [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5895.16s)]
*  I'm curious if his presence helps if he is still an asset [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5897.88s)]
*  Or if what we're seeing in polls that his favorabilities are coming down his unfavorables are rising like the black focus group people [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5902.84s)]
*  Have concerns about him? [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5909.56s)]
*  Does he become a liability and if he does [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5911.8s)]
*  That will be interesting right as we head into more doge cuts [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5915.240000000001s)]
*  We we head into this bill the reconciliation bill [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5919.240000000001s)]
*  It will start to say to republicans perhaps the perhaps the ground is shifting [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5922.6s)]
*  Hmm [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5927.88s)]
*  I don't like the chances in wisconsin [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5929.56s)]
*  But i'm heartened by the fact that the polls in wisconsin are never correct [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5931.64s)]
*  I mean, it's just like you you can't it's like having no poll whatsoever [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5936.36s)]
*  So I suppose anything could happen because trump won it so, you know, it's not like there's no [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5940.36s)]
*  Johnson so did scott walker it tends to break to the right at the end [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5946.76s)]
*  But that assumes a strong ground game and as you know, these off-year ones are just so [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5951.16s)]
*  so [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5955.8s)]
*  So, uh reading electorate is very difficult. So I I mean that's you're absolutely right. That's the one one piece of hope [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5957.32s)]
*  The gop has to learn to win without trump because you know, he's not going to be on the ballot again [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5964.280000000001s)]
*  I mean, I know there's some ban and talk but he's not going to be on the banner on the ballot again [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xWbVzAE_0XY&t=5970.52s)]
