# Bizarre Group Chat Details, Media Compares Trump to Nixon, and MK Media Launch, with Kirn and Taibbi
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. We have a lot to get to today. But before we do, I have some good and exciting news that I want to share with you. And it has to do with all of you getting a lot more content from some of our and your favorite guests of the Megyn Kelly show. The show has been growing like crazy. Thanks to all of you. We are deeply grateful. And last month, as you may know, we added a new show to our podcast and YouTube feed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=0.0s)]
*  It's called AM Update and the response has been super strong, far exceeded all of our hopes and expectations. If you're not consuming it, by the way, you can get it on our podcast feed or on our YouTube feed. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=30.0s)]
*  And it's about a 1516 minute morning news update so you can kick off your day with what we think are the most important stories. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=41.0s)]
*  And today we are announcing the launch of MK Media, a podcast network of video and audio shows which we are going to produce and help promote. And we are starting with three out of the gate, which will launch in April and May. So you're not going to have to wait very long to consume them. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=50.0s)]
*  The first three are Next Up with Mark Halperin from the independent journalist and bestselling author Mark Halperin, The Nerve with Maureen Callahan from our pal Maureen, who is also a Daily Mail cultural columnist and a bestselling author, and Spot On with Link Lauren from the great political commentator and influencer Link Lauren. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=69.0s)]
*  I'm so excited about these three. Aren't these a great three to launch with? They cover the gamut, right? It's like Link has got such a following amongst young sort of right leaning people or independent minded people who have just had it with the weird left. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=92.0s)]
*  I hear from so many young people who are like, I love Link. He's love about he's got such a following Maureen. Do I even need to say anything? I mean, we all love her. She first started coming on and I loved reading Maureen, but I didn't know how she do in an interview. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=109.0s)]
*  You know when you have to do spoken word and you could see right from the get go, there was something special there and the more she came on, the better she got. And now of course, she's just an A plus guest. And whenever we have her on, we get the most positive comments from all of you. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=125.0s)]
*  So she's going to be amazing. And I love the name of that show, The Nerve and Mark Halpern. I mean, can you name anybody you wanted to hear from more in the lead up to the last election than Mark? It's like when Mark would speak, you'd put down your pen and listen. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=140.0s)]
*  He was somebody who you, you know, I always talk about how I'm doing my makeup or I'm cleaning my house or something while I'm listening to podcasts. Mark Halpern is the kind of commentator where you just stop the other thing and you just listen and sometimes you rewind it to hear it again. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=155.0s)]
*  He's extremely well connected, very well researched and just a very, very stand up guy when it comes to his political journalism and you can just take it to the bank. And so I'm thrilled that we're going to be getting into business with these three and helping promote their independent podcasts. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=170.0s)]
*  So thanks to all of you for helping make that possible for us to not just grow our show, but to help grow other shows. We're not done. By the way, you're going to be able to find these shows on their, they'll have their own podcast feeds under those names and their own YouTube channels and their own social media accounts. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=188.0s)]
*  And we're going to help them build all of those. But that's not all we're doing. MK Media is going to continue to expand. We're in talks with a bunch of folks and we will have more announcements to come soon. Some beyond just news and entertainment, by the way. More on that as we launch these other programs. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=207.0s)]
*  Look, what I'm basically looking to do is to help promote more sane, reasonable, and ideally entertaining people who have unique perspectives and the courage to say the truth. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=224.0s)]
*  It's like, I'm extremely grateful for the platform that we have and the audience that we have. But I also think it's important to, you know, the only thing I can think is the terrible Barack Obama phrase of spread the wealth around. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=237.0s)]
*  What I mean is just you want a lot of options, right? You want to hear somebody, for example, in Maureen, in the cultural lane, who devotes a whole show to that, just ripping on all the big stories of the day that we don't always get to on a show like this one that's maybe a little harder news focused. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=254.0s)]
*  You know, we do a lot of culture, but it'll be great to have somebody singularly focused like that, that we can help promote. Mark, too, he's almost all hard news. He doesn't really do a lot of the culture stuff. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=271.0s)]
*  Link, he does it all, but he loves culture. He's a little younger and I think speaks to a different audience. Anyway, it's just all coming together. And I love being in a place now, thanks to you guys, to help those folks get their voice heard by as many people as humanly possible. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=281.0s)]
*  You know, look at the monopoly the left has had on the news and the conversation for all of the country's modern history. It's only been the last couple of years that the right and the independent minded have developed this new lane. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=299.0s)]
*  So whatever I can do to help smart, honest, fact based voices grow in that lane, I am committed to do, to doing. So I'm going to. Okay, so thank you. Stay tuned and let's get to the news and the drama over the Signal Group chat. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=314.0s)]
*  Now you heard this story yesterday, right? The long and the short of it is a group of Trump's top security officials, Pete Hegseth, Secretary of Defense, Mike Walls, National Security Advisor, and JD Vance, our Vice President, and others were on a group text chain that I think involved 19 people in total. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=333.0s)]
*  And Mike Walls appears to have been the one though, not totally confirmed, who added clearly accidentally, the Atlantic Editor in Chief, Jeffrey Goldberg, who's just of all people to add just the worst person. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=350.0s)]
*  You know how many stories he's gotten wrong? Let me put it this way. He thinks that Mark Milley is a patriot and wrote a whole article calling him the patriot for his promise to betray the sitting president of the United States and to tell the Chinese if we ever decided to plan some attack on them. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=367.0s)]
*  That would be treason. That would be punishable by death. It's not something that makes you a patriot unless you're Jeffrey Goldberg. And that's how you see that. And that's how you see all stories involving Trump or any Republican. So the fact that he got added is a nightmare. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=386.0s)]
*  There are some people saying Mike Walls is a neocon. That's why he had Jeffrey Goldberg. Can I tell you, if you saw the people in my contacts, you wouldn't know what to think. You'd be so confused. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=401.0s)]
*  Because in Mike Walls' position as a guy who's been in politics forever, or in Jeffrey Goldberg's, frankly, you have a lot of contacts. You meet people, they give you their contact, you put it in there, you never know when you might need them or you might need to yell at them. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=413.0s)]
*  In Mike Walls' case with Goldberg, I don't think you can draw any conclusions from the fact that he had him in the contacts and we don't know who he was trying to add. But clearly, he made a mistake. And now the left is treating this like we had a nuclear meltdown as a result of inappropriate group messaging on Signal. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=432.0s)]
*  And I'll just start by saying this. If it were me and I were the administration, I think I would have just said, we made a mistake. We'll look into how it happened and we'll let you know. Thank God nothing bad came out of it. And it was on an encrypted channel, thank goodness. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=453.0s)]
*  But sure, we can shore up our communications and will. And that's it. This is not Watergate. This is not the Pentagon Papers. People need to calm the F down. The mission they were discussing when we fought back against the Houthis in Yemen, that was a huge success. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=468.0s)]
*  We took out a bunch of Houthi leadership. We threatened Iran. It went off without a hitch. It's true. It could have gone poorly if Mike Walls had CC'd like Iran. I'm guessing like that's probably not a contact he just would have abbreviated on there. But in any event, it didn't go badly. It didn't get leaked to anybody other than yes, a guy who hates Republicans, but doesn't necessarily hate America. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=490.0s)]
*  And he did nothing to undermine the mission. So that's where it is. It's really not that big a deal. It's not great. Don't get me wrong. It's not great. We don't have to treat this like everything about the report is wrong. Whatever. He clearly got added erroneously. Can we move on? It's bad. You should fix it. Tell us how you're going to fix the communications. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=520.0s)]
*  Off we go. All right. Joining me now to discuss that and all the stories in the news, the hosts of the America This Week podcast, author and novelist Walter Kern and racket news editor, Matt Taibbi. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=540.0s)]

*  Great to have you back guys. How you doing? [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=632.0s)]
*  Very good. Megan. Splendidly. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=635.0s)]
*  So what do you what do you make of my take on Signal Gate? Signal being the encrypted messaging app where they were having this conversation and and clearly had the eventually oh shit moment of realizing somebody had added Jeffrey Goldberg to the message chain. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=639.0s)]
*  Matt, I'll start with you. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=658.0s)]
*  I think I need to know a little bit more about how this story happened before I can accurately comment on it because the notion that of all people in the world, the journalist who is probably most hostile to Donald Trump was added to this chat chain about an attack on Yemen. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=660.0s)]
*  It's so incredibly improbable that the circumstances of it need to be understood fully before we can properly assess it. I think I mean, was it a genuine accident or what else happened here? [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=673.0s)]
*  It just did something about it doesn't smell like it. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=687.0s)]
*  That's interesting. There is some speculation online just on X, you know, random folks posting. Is there any chance he was intentionally added as a means of getting a discussion which didn't make sense to me. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=689.0s)]
*  I think to the contrary, it made them all look very thoughtful and they're debating the pros and cons. And, you know, is this something that we really want to take on? That's what JD was saying. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=702.0s)]
*  Like, Europe has 40% of its commerce going through these channels. And I think that's a very good point. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=710.0s)]
*  We have three, you know, should it really be our problem? And then some exchange about, well, yeah, but we're the only ones who can do it. So if we're going to push back at all, it should be us. Whatever. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=716.0s)]
*  The actual chatter did not make them look bad. It was simply the fact that it was happening on top of the whole thing. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=726.0s)]
*  And they added Jeffrey Goldberg. So Walter, that some of the speculation online was, did they intentionally add him so that they could possibly telegraph to the Europeans, you know, where we actually stand on this and that they may need to put it on the top of the list? [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=732.0s)]
*  Well, there's zero evidence to support any of that. That's just I'm just picking up on what Matt suggested there. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=748.0s)]
*  they could possibly telegraph to the Europeans, [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=753.0s)]
*  you know, where we actually stand on this [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=758.1s)]
*  and that they may need to pick up any slack [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=760.3s)]
*  that happens from this point forward. [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=763.26s)]
*  There's zero evidence to support any of that. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=765.5s)]
*  That's just, I'm just picking up [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=767.26s)]
*  on what Matt suggested there. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=768.3s)]
*  Well, what I found curious is that if I were [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=771.52s)]
*  a somewhat hostile journalist and were added accidentally [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=775.38s)]
*  to a group chat that included the vice president, [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=779.12s)]
*  the secretary of defense, and a national security advisor, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=781.76s)]
*  I would lay low for a while and not blow my cover. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  I would say, oh wow, I just got an accidental pipeline [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=789.46s)]
*  into the very heart of the security state. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=792.96s)]
*  Maybe I'm not gonna come out the first time [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=795.48s)]
*  I get a little bit of news. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=798.14s)]
*  So it was interesting to me that Goldberg decided [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=799.88s)]
*  to sort of blow this once in a lifetime chance [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=803.44s)]
*  to surveil the inside of the lighthouse. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=807.4s)]
*  I think it had a four year scoop. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=811.06s)]
*  Oh, exactly. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=813.4599999999999s)]
*  I'd have been writing a book. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=814.3s)]
*  Waiting for the World War III war plan, [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=816.02s)]
*  not the bombing of the Houthis, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=818.26s)]
*  which isn't all that controversial. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=820.0999999999999s)]
*  But as you say- [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=823.9s)]
*  No, that's a good point. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=825.02s)]
*  As you say, I think it made Vance in particular look good. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=826.3399999999999s)]
*  He can't be construed as a Trump toady [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=830.3399999999999s)]
*  after looking at this. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=834.8399999999999s)]
*  He had some principled differences with Donald Trump. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=836.74s)]
*  He said this conflicts with our messaging about Ukraine, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=840.8000000000001s)]
*  with our general anti-war stance. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=843.8000000000001s)]
*  Also, as you mentioned, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=846.64s)]
*  it seems to favor the European interests over our own. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=849.0400000000001s)]
*  If we're gonna play games with conspiracy theories [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=853.24s)]
*  and 40 chess, it's JD Vance I think who comes out [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=856.96s)]
*  looking best because it shows that he's both in the loop, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=860.4000000000001s)]
*  independent, thoughtful, and nobody's fool. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=864.2800000000001s)]
*  At the same time, he plays with the team. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=868.8199999999999s)]
*  All I know is that I'm Jeffrey Goldberg sitting there [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=872.58s)]
*  going, wow, I had a bug in the White House, [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=875.06s)]
*  now I don't. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=878.54s)]
*  Also, I have never- [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=879.8199999999999s)]
*  That's so true. [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=880.66s)]
*  Somebody online said it should be a criminal act [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=881.5s)]
*  not to share the group text chains [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=887.08s)]
*  that Jeffrey Goldberg had internally [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=889.9s)]
*  when realizing that this was a real text chain [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=892.64s)]
*  he was on with the national security team. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=896.14s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=898.4399999999999s)]
*  And then of course, even better would have been [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=899.72s)]
*  to see the reaction of the people. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=902.0s)]
*  Who among us hasn't CC'd somebody where you're like, [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=903.76s)]
*  oh God, I didn't mean to do that. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=907.4s)]
*  But this is next level. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=909.56s)]
*  This one's not your average oh shit moment, Matt. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=911.6s)]
*  And of course, the Democrats who have completely fallen [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=914.76s)]
*  apart, who have zero support amongst their own party. [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=918.84s)]
*  We talked about yesterday some of the numbers on Team Blue. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=922.0s)]
*  They're in worse shape now [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=924.88s)]
*  than they've been in 50 years [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=927.2s)]
*  since an opportunity to have a good news cycle. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=930.34s)]
*  And they're right to capitalize. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=933.6600000000001s)]
*  I mean, if I were a Democrat looking to change the narrative [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=935.34s)]
*  about what a mess my party is, sure, [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=937.9000000000001s)]
*  this will do for a couple of days. [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=940.5s)]
*  I'll ride this one. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=941.82s)]
*  And so what we saw this morning in front of Senate Intel [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=943.94s)]
*  was they called in the national security apparatus. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=946.86s)]
*  This is a pre-scheduled thing on global threats. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=949.5400000000001s)]
*  And they decided to make the most of this [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=952.44s)]
*  including Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=954.56s)]
*  who's a Dem versus Tulsi Gabbard [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=958.28s)]
*  and John Ratcliffe, head of CIA. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=960.28s)]
*  Watch. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=962.4s)]
*  Director Gabbard, did you participate in the group chat [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=963.24s)]
*  with Secretary of Defense and other Trump senior officials [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=966.3199999999999s)]
*  discussing the Yemen war plans? [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=969.56s)]
*  Senator, I don't want to get into it. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=972.16s)]
*  If it's not classified, share the text now. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=973.7199999999999s)]
*  So you were the John Ratcliffe on that chat. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=977.12s)]
*  I was. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=979.12s)]
*  Thank you, thank you. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=979.9599999999999s)]
*  Can I provide some context, Senator, to that? [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=981.12s)]
*  Yes, but I've got a series of questions. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=984.18s)]
*  But I think it's important because at the outset, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=986.3399999999999s)]
*  you made a couple of comments about signal messaging [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=988.5s)]
*  using encrypted apps so that we're clear. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=991.42s)]
*  One of the first things that happened [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=994.14s)]
*  when I was confirmed as CIA director [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=995.5s)]
*  was signal was loaded onto my computer at the CIA, [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=998.24s)]
*  as it is for most CIA officers. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1001.9s)]
*  One of the things that I was briefed on very early, Senator, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1005.5799999999999s)]
*  was by the CIA records management folks [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1008.9399999999999s)]
*  about the use of signal as a permissible work use. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1012.8s)]
*  It is. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1016.64s)]
*  That is a practice that preceded the current administration [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1017.68s)]
*  to the Biden administration. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1021.28s)]
*  Director Ratcliffe, I've got a series of questions. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1022.12s)]
*  I, do you, if you're making the statement, [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1024.1599999999999s)]
*  the signal is a secure channel. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1028.24s)]
*  To be clear, in a signal message group, [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1030.36s)]
*  we're entirely permissible and lawful [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1033.3999999999999s)]
*  and did not include classified information. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1036.6799999999998s)]
*  There was no classified material [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1039.3999999999999s)]
*  that was shared in that signal. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1040.92s)]
*  So then if there are no classified immaterial, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1042.14s)]
*  share it with the committee. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1044.54s)]
*  This is strangely familiar, [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1046.0600000000002s)]
*  and I think my colleagues remember, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1047.3400000000001s)]
*  when you couldn't answer the question, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1049.54s)]
*  is Edward Snowden a traitor? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1050.94s)]
*  And I have serious doubts about your, anyway. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1054.02s)]
*  It's just like when she wouldn't say [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1061.1000000000001s)]
*  that Edward Snowden is a traitor. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1063.48s)]
*  This is just like that, Matt. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1065.3000000000002s)]
*  So it's incredibly humorous to watch Mark Warner [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1067.82s)]
*  talking about breaches of security [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1073.46s)]
*  when his own Senate Select Committee on Intelligence [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1075.58s)]
*  suffered an extraordinary breach of security [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1079.1799999999998s)]
*  when the head of security for the committee [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1082.46s)]
*  was indicted for leaking material [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1086.22s)]
*  that led to the publication of the FISA warrant [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1089.26s)]
*  on Carter Page in 2017. [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1093.8799999999999s)]
*  Remember the indictment involving James Wolfe? [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1097.5s)]
*  Now that was a story where the circumstances [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1100.08s)]
*  were kind of mysterious because it was a story [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1102.9799999999998s)]
*  that seemed like certain people [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1105.3799999999999s)]
*  would have wanted to get out, [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1107.6s)]
*  but that really was classified information [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1109.78s)]
*  that was illegal to leak, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1112.6799999999998s)]
*  and it did end up in the press. [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1115.04s)]
*  And it was a major scandal, both journalistically [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1117.36s)]
*  and in the history of Congress. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1121.52s)]
*  So for him to talk about this situation [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1124.08s)]
*  where they're not exchanging classified material, [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1127.72s)]
*  they're not sitting in a skiff, [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1130.04s)]
*  and they're simply discussing an operation [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1131.72s)]
*  that may be sensitive but not classified, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1135.48s)]
*  when he says, I demand that you give us that material, [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1139.4s)]
*  there's no reason why Gabbard and Radcliffe [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1144.4s)]
*  can't just say no. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1148.8799999999999s)]
*  We don't have to give you anything. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1151.16s)]
*  Right? [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1152.48s)]
*  By the way, I think we're T minus 72 hours [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1153.32s)]
*  before Jeffrey Goldberg releases it anyway [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1156.28s)]
*  with maybe a couple of things redacted, [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1158.32s)]
*  but I don't think he's gonna stay in this, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1160.36s)]
*  I'm above it all and I won't release it. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1162.92s)]
*  I don't think he can help himself. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1165.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, they can subpoena him and get it anyway. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1168.04s)]
*  So what's the problem here? [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1170.12s)]
*  Why does the Trump administration have to go first? [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1172.56s)]
*  This feels like a giant advertisement for Signal to me. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1175.16s)]
*  We find out that the CIA uses it and trusts it. [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1178.48s)]
*  Well, at least they went to... [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1183.52s)]
*  Peter Stroke, the head of counterintelligence [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1185.64s)]
*  over at the FBI was talking to his mistress [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1187.88s)]
*  about how he was gonna disrupt the Trump administration [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1190.88s)]
*  on regular text messaging apps. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1193.3200000000002s)]
*  At least they've scaled up a little here. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1198.28s)]
*  Yeah, good point. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1200.76s)]
*  Here's some more Democrat anger. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1201.68s)]
*  It's genuine anger, I'm sure. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1203.92s)]
*  Like the kind they showed when Lloyd Austin [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1206.36s)]
*  went AWOL for days without telling anybody where he was. [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1208.76s)]
*  Oh no, wait, that never happened. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1211.1599999999999s)]
*  Here is Michael Bennett of Colorado sparring [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1213.8799999999999s)]

*  Who added Jeffrey Goldberg? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1286.4s)]
*  That's it, period. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1287.88s)]
*  Michael Bennett has spoken. [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1289.2s)]

*  But don't you think, Walter, when Mike Walz [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1331.7199999999998s)]
*  sets up your Signal chat, you're like, [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1334.12s)]

*  I have better tradecraft than Mike Walz, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1343.84s)]

*  Why should I here in Montana with my strange group [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1348.3999999999999s)]
*  of friends, which are similar to yours, I imagine, Megan, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1351.36s)]

*  And the more I think about this and the more I look at it, [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1364.6799999999998s)]
*  that the Democrats were ready to pounce on it suggests, [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1367.3999999999999s)]

*  You guys are, you're going to the dark place. [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1377.6799999999998s)]
*  Go ahead, Matt. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1380.3999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, and again, not to speak about Michael Bennett [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1382.08s)]
*  specifically, but for members of the US Senate [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1385.1599999999999s)]
*  to talk about an inadvertent leak as if it were [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1389.1599999999999s)]
*  this dire life-threatening matter of national security [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1395.2399999999998s)]
*  when throughout the entire first presidency of Donald Trump, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1398.76s)]
*  there were epidemic, illegal leaks [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1402.76s)]
*  of classified intelligence from everything involving, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1405.6s)]
*  you know, the signals intelligence about Michael Flynn [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1409.44s)]
*  talking to the Russian ambassador, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1411.76s)]
*  to the alleged contact between Donald Trump [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1415.04s)]
*  and members of Russian intelligence, [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1420.12s)]
*  to the, you know, figures connected to Trump [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1422.8799999999999s)]
*  or known and suspected Russian agents, [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1426.6s)]
*  to the Alexander Downer stuff. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1430.44s)]
*  I mean, I did a story about this once and made a list [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1432.12s)]
*  and I had like 14 or 15 different illegal leaks [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1436.0s)]
*  that came out. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1438.68s)]
*  All reporters knew what was going on during that time. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1439.8s)]
*  There were tons and tons of material [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1442.24s)]
*  that were being discussed in skiffs. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1444.68s)]
*  And what would happen would be like some kind of aid [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1446.56s)]
*  from Congress would call you [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1449.48s)]
*  and would essentially confirm the details [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1452.08s)]
*  of a classified story and then would put you on the phone [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1455.84s)]
*  with somebody else who would be the second person [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1459.84s)]
*  to confirm the story. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1462.36s)]
*  This was going on constantly. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1463.48s)]
*  It drove most of the major Russian gate stories [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1464.76s)]
*  during the Trump period. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1467.3600000000001s)]
*  Isn't that now Natasha Bertrand made her name? [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1468.2s)]
*  Right, yeah, I mean, this is what journalism was [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1471.64s)]
*  for years and years and years [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1476.1200000000001s)]
*  and politics for that matter, right? [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1477.92s)]
*  And none of that stuff was ever investigated or punished [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1480.48s)]
*  even though it went on in the open. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1483.72s)]
*  So I'm a little bit amazed that this not illegal situation [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1486.2s)]
*  is being investigated so vehemently. [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1491.2s)]
*  And let's remember one more. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1495.16s)]
*  Plus, okay, what did they do? [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1496.0s)]
*  They discussed war plans which went off without a hitch [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1497.16s)]
*  while inadvertently cc'ing a reporter. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1501.1200000000001s)]
*  No one's claiming this is a good thing. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1503.6000000000001s)]
*  However, it's like, can the same people [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1505.56s)]
*  who could barely muster any outrage, [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1508.52s)]
*  I mean, truly, not barely, who really in many cases [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1511.04s)]
*  didn't muster outrage at all [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1514.04s)]
*  for the disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1517.4s)]
*  for Abbey Gate, for actual military debacles [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1520.56s)]
*  that have happened in the recent past, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1525.04s)]
*  they said nothing, like they weren't outraged. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1528.68s)]
*  But now they want us to believe [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1531.0s)]
*  that they're really horrified [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1532.36s)]
*  that one reporter got a heads up [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1534.08s)]
*  on an action against the Houthis. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1536.24s)]
*  I don't buy it, Walter. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1538.08s)]
*  One thing that's interesting is that this is an actual war [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1540.68s)]
*  plan that everyone agreed with, except maybe JD Vance. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1543.44s)]
*  I mean, Jeffrey Goldberg, [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1546.68s)]
*  it's not like they put Alex Jones on the chat. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1547.96s)]
*  Jeffrey Goldberg, I'm sure agrees with, [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1550.56s)]
*  yeah, agree, yeah, and that would have been interesting. [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1554.76s)]
*  But bombing the Houthis is not something [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1557.32s)]
*  that I think Jeffrey Goldberg disagrees with. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1559.56s)]
*  I don't even think that the Senate committee [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1561.76s)]
*  disagrees with it. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1564.28s)]
*  It's interesting that this is a policy [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1565.24s)]
*  that really there was unanimity on, [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1567.4s)]
*  except in the case of Vance. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1569.72s)]
*  And when this first broke, it was an anti-Vance story. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1572.4s)]
*  That was how it was being spun. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1575.8s)]
*  Vance and Trump are at odds. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1577.64s)]
*  That didn't survive the first news cycle, [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1579.8000000000002s)]
*  but it was how they first headlined this thing. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1583.2800000000002s)]
*  And meanwhile, all Vance said was, [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1586.88s)]
*  I'm not sure the president is aware [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1588.64s)]
*  of how inconsistent this move is with his stated goals, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1590.0800000000002s)]
*  which is make the Europeans start paying their fair share. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1594.44s)]
*  He wasn't saying the president is wrong to do this. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1596.8400000000001s)]
*  He's saying, is he aware of, for example, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1599.2s)]
*  the 40% that Europe uses these channels [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1602.44s)]
*  versus the 3% that we do? [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1604.8000000000002s)]
*  He wasn't like, Trump's an idiot. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1606.04s)]
*  Trump's wrong. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1607.88s)]
*  He was like, I don't know [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1608.88s)]
*  whether the president knows this stuff. [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1609.72s)]
*  They're having lunch today pre-scheduled, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1611.24s)]
*  but Vance and Trump, but the White House is making clear [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1613.0s)]
*  there's absolutely no daylight between these two. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1616.52s)]
*  And I will say this. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1618.08s)]
*  I'd love to talk to you guys about the messaging now, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1619.48s)]
*  because my own take on it is Trump, as usual, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1621.36s)]
*  is hitting just the right tone in handling. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1626.6s)]
*  He's like, Walz is a good guy, made a mistake. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1629.28s)]
*  He'll learn, it's fine. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1633.08s)]
*  He seems to totally have Mike Walz's back. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1635.08s)]
*  That was said directly to a couple of reporters this morning. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1638.68s)]
*  Peter Ducey was one of them. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1642.44s)]
*  And who was the other one, Steve, who got, [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1644.0s)]
*  it was an NBC reporter. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1647.24s)]
*  Oh, Garrett Haake, yeah, in the gaggle. [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1648.8s)]
*  Do we have that on cam, Trump's tone? [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1651.96s)]
*  We do, I think, right? [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1653.72s)]
*  No, we don't have that. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1655.72s)]
*  Oh, because it wasn't on cam. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1656.6399999999999s)]
*  But yesterday he came out and he's like, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1658.2s)]
*  I'm just learning about this for the first time. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1660.56s)]
*  Today, I think he's nailed it where he's like, [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1661.92s)]
*  you know, it's a mistake. [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1664.24s)]
*  The operation went off perfectly, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1665.24s)]
*  and Mike Walz is a good guy. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1666.8s)]
*  I would say, I think Pete Hegseth, who I really care about, [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1668.6399999999999s)]
*  but I think he's a little too defensive. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1672.8s)]
*  He's probably feeling a little like, whoa. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1674.24s)]
*  He's like, they're not war plans. [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1676.8799999999999s)]
*  I didn't text war plans. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1678.6399999999999s)]
*  This, it's coming down to like a debate over semantics. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1680.72s)]
*  Do we care? [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1684.56s)]
*  Like, personally, I don't really care [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1686.4399999999998s)]
*  if he texted him like a blueprint with like, [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1689.1599999999999s)]
*  and then the F-16 is gonna come in here, [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1691.9199999999998s)]
*  and then if they do this, we'll do that. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1694.52s)]
*  I mean, imagine that's what an actual war plan looks like, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1695.3600000000001s)]
*  but I have no idea. [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1696.92s)]
*  Or if it's just, we're gonna overwhelm them [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1698.44s)]
*  with the following air power. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1701.52s)]
*  We've also got an aircraft carrier in there. [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1702.8400000000001s)]
*  You know, like the general things that you would be telling [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1704.48s)]
*  the Tulseys of the world and the JDs of the world [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1706.88s)]
*  to generally let them know how large or small [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1710.1200000000001s)]
*  this thing is gonna be. [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1713.04s)]
*  So what do you make of the tone and the tenor [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1713.88s)]
*  of the messaging from those who are on defense today? [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1717.24s)]
*  I think the administration comes out looking not so bad. [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1720.36s)]
*  I mean, the security leak is obviously not great. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1724.36s)]
*  I mean, and it's going to invite criticisms [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1730.36s)]
*  that these people are inexperienced. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1732.4s)]
*  They don't know what they're doing, right? [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1734.44s)]
*  They're already saying that in droves. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1735.52s)]
*  But as to the actual discussions, [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1737.96s)]
*  it's not like you had a bunch of people saying, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1740.24s)]
*  wait, where's Yemen again? [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1742.4s)]
*  Is that next to Panama? [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1743.72s)]
*  I mean, they seem to know what they were doing. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1744.84s)]
*  Remember Gary Johnson? [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1748.28s)]
*  What is Aleppo? [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1749.3999999999999s)]
*  What is Aleppo? [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1751.6s)]
*  On MSNBC? [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1752.4399999999998s)]
*  Running for president. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1753.76s)]
*  That would be that. [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1756.6s)]
*  Or what does Israel want us to do? [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1757.4399999999998s)]
*  Can somebody call them up? [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1760.2399999999998s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1761.6399999999999s)]
*  We didn't see evidence of that. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1763.4399999999998s)]
*  See, I think Trump's management style is brilliant. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1765.04s)]
*  Or Putin. [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1767.6799999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah, exactly. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1769.28s)]
*  Yeah, can somebody call Putin and find out [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1770.3999999999999s)]
*  whether he's behind this? [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1772.3999999999999s)]
*  One time I was in a meeting with a friend [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1774.76s)]
*  one time I almost burnt down a gas station I worked in. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1777.36s)]
*  It created smoke and a terrible smell. [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1780.96s)]
*  I cleaned it up as best I could. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1783.3999999999999s)]
*  The next day the boss came in and instead of punishing me, [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1784.9199999999998s)]
*  he looked around, sniffed the air and said, [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1789.28s)]
*  hmm, I feel like something went on here. [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1791.52s)]
*  Carry on. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1793.56s)]
*  It was the greatest act of discipline I've ever received [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1794.6s)]
*  because to withhold punishment sometimes [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1797.84s)]
*  is to show true dominance. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1800.72s)]
*  And I think that's what Trump has done here. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1803.28s)]
*  The ability to give grace in this situation [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1805.68s)]
*  is also in its shadow form, the ability to get rid of you. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1808.68s)]
*  And I think everybody is gonna shape up from now on. [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1813.2s)]
*  Also, I have to say that just quickly, [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1817.48s)]
*  I think it makes Vance look good. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1820.6399999999999s)]
*  It shows that he's willing to stand up for what he thinks [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1823.04s)]
*  and give his opinion. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1827.0s)]
*  And that's what we want a vice president to do. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1828.04s)]
*  If there is any disagreement [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1831.12s)]
*  or if he is challenging the idea, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1832.8400000000001s)]
*  isn't that what we want from these people? [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1835.76s)]
*  That we want them to discuss it? [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1838.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm not really sure I understand what the controversy [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1839.5600000000002s)]
*  is apart from the security leak. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1842.04s)]
*  Yeah, and he's not- [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1844.0800000000002s)]
*  If the Democrats could design a security leak, [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1846.04s)]
*  it would be to Jeffrey Goldberg. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1848.4s)]
*  Why are they acting like they're unhappy with this thing? [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1850.3600000000001s)]
*  I'm surprised they're not passing the law that it- [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1853.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah, yeah. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1856.76s)]
*  It's 100% because they're members. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1858.2s)]
*  I will say this, Doug Brunt, my husband, [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1860.6s)]
*  was not that long ago pulled over by a cop [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1863.24s)]
*  on his way home from dropping the kids off at school. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1866.6799999999998s)]
*  And the cop said, do you know what you did? [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1869.84s)]
*  And Doug said, yep, I did a little bit of a rolling stop [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1872.52s)]
*  at that stop sign. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1876.84s)]
*  The cop was like, thank you, thank you for admitting it [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1878.1999999999998s)]
*  and let him go. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1881.6399999999999s)]
*  To your point, Walter, I pardon you. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1882.6s)]
*  He showed benevolence and it was the ultimate power move. [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1884.7199999999998s)]
*  In Doug's defense, it's a very safe intersection. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1888.1599999999999s)]
*  Most people come to a rolling stop, [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1890.68s)]
*  but Doug Brunt doesn't anymore [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1891.96s)]
*  because now you only get one pass out of that problem [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1893.2s)]
*  for free. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1896.52s)]
*  In any event, this will, I think, be blown over [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1897.36s)]
*  in probably another day or two at the most. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1899.3999999999999s)]
*  It is interesting though, that they are already using Signal. [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1903.08s)]
*  You heard Ratcliffe saying that in his testimony [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1907.2s)]
*  that we got to the CIA and found out [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1910.0s)]
*  that they're using Signal all over these government devices. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1912.12s)]
*  It was used by the Biden administration. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1916.2s)]
*  We've confirmed that too. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1918.52s)]
*  They said, oh, but rarely. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1920.44s)]
*  Well, I don't know whether that's true or not, right? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1921.96s)]
*  It's like, maybe they didn't make the stupid mistake [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1924.08s)]
*  of copying in a reporter from Fox News. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1926.24s)]
*  But look, if this is something [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1929.44s)]
*  that they don't want to have happen, [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1931.3600000000001s)]
*  it should be stricken from all administrations, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1932.72s)]
*  not just the Republican ones. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1934.84s)]
*  All right, let's keep going [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1936.84s)]
*  because there's a lot to get through today. [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1937.68s)]
*  The matter of whether Trump was allowed to deport [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1940.28s)]
*  all these alleged trend to Aragwa gang members [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1943.48s)]
*  on three flights, only two of which are at issue. [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1947.8s)]
*  Here's, I can understand one flight's not at issue [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1951.44s)]
*  because nobody on it was being deported [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1954.32s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1957.04s)]
*  Two flights are at issue because the people on board [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1960.4s)]
*  were all being deported, at least in part, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1963.12s)]
*  due to Trump's invocation of that act [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1966.8s)]
*  and his powers under it, which say, [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1969.56s)]
*  if you're at war or you're suffering an invasion [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1971.72s)]
*  or some sort of incursion, the president can declare that, [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1974.28s)]
*  well, Congress has to declare war, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1978.36s)]
*  but the president can declare the other two [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1979.2s)]
*  and then classify people as parts of it, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1980.92s)]
*  sort of enemy actors, and then they can be deported [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1985.08s)]
*  without due process. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1987.6s)]
*  That's what's so appealing to the Trump administration [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1988.8s)]
*  about the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1992.36s)]
*  You can boot them, really kind of no questions asked, [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1994.0s)]
*  get out. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1997.2s)]
*  I've actually just been looking into this. [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1998.04s)]
*  Maybe immigration lawyers have this at the ready. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=1999.12s)]
*  But here's the story. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2002.0s)]
*  Under the regular immigration law [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2003.8s)]
*  where we have expedited deportation, expedited removal, [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2009.36s)]
*  you can kick somebody out if you catch them at the border. [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2014.76s)]
*  That was true for a long time under Trump or under Obama, [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2017.28s)]
*  under Biden, these agents who catch somebody [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2020.2s)]
*  sneaking across the border, [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2022.3999999999999s)]
*  they don't have to let them have a whole hearing. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2023.96s)]
*  Just get out. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2026.52s)]
*  I caught you. [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2027.52s)]
*  Go back home. [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2028.36s)]
*  Kick them out. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2029.24s)]
*  They're entitled to nothing, no due process, nothing. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2030.08s)]
*  And it's under this expedited removal power. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2033.4s)]
*  And it usually applies to about 100 miles [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2034.96s)]
*  around the southern border. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2038.2s)]
*  Well, Trump, as he did in Trump 1.0, [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2039.96s)]
*  has expanded it by executive order [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2042.24s)]
*  to reach pretty much all of the United States, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2044.32s)]
*  to where our border agents like Tom Homan, [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2047.04s)]
*  if they find you and they, [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2049.28s)]
*  I don't know what the standard is, [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2051.64s)]
*  probable cause, most likely, [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2052.76s)]
*  to believe that you're a Venezuelan gang member, [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2054.68s)]
*  can remove you, no questions asked. [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2056.88s)]
*  The downside of using just that expedited removal power, [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2059.36s)]
*  which is being challenged legally, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2062.84s)]
*  is that if the person says, [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2064.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm seeking asylum, I'm seeking asylum, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2066.88s)]
*  you have to give them the asylum hearing. [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2069.44s)]
*  It slows the whole thing down. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2071.36s)]
*  These illegals take advantage of that. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2073.0s)]
*  They're not really seeking asylum. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2074.56s)]
*  They came through four different other countries [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2076.2400000000002s)]
*  where they could have gotten asylum. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2077.76s)]
*  They just wanna be here. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2079.04s)]
*  Anyway, that's why Trump decided to invoke [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2080.4s)]
*  this Alien Enemies Act, [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2083.6800000000003s)]
*  which does not allow the asylum escape hatch. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2085.72s)]
*  And what's happening right now in courts [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2089.8799999999997s)]
*  is there's a debate about whether these people deported [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2091.8399999999997s)]
*  by Trump under their Alien Enemies Act [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2095.8399999999997s)]
*  are entitled to any level of due process [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2098.3199999999997s)]
*  before we declare them Venezuelan gang members. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2102.8399999999997s)]
*  No one's talking about striking down [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2107.0s)]
*  the Alien Enemies Act, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2108.64s)]
*  which has already been upheld by the US Supreme Court, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2110.52s)]
*  and the Supreme Court has held [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2112.6s)]
*  there's no right to judicial review [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2114.44s)]
*  of most of the president's decisions under that act. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2117.4s)]
*  But what's being discussed and argued [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2120.48s)]
*  both at the district court level with this Judge Boesberg [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2122.52s)]
*  and yesterday at the Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2125.04s)]
*  a three-judge panel, one Judge and Obama appointee, [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2127.4s)]
*  one a George H.W. Bush appointee, [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2130.28s)]
*  and one a Trump appointee, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2132.44s)]
*  is do these people get any sort of due process [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2134.68s)]
*  before we label them Venezuela gang members [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2138.92s)]
*  and then put them on these planes? [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2141.12s)]
*  If they do get some, what does it look like? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2144.36s)]
*  Do they just file what's known as a habeas petition [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2147.28s)]
*  where they get to say, whoa, whoa, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2149.6400000000003s)]
*  I'm not even from Venezuela? [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2151.2000000000003s)]
*  And if so, shouldn't that have been filed [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2153.0s)]
*  where they were being held, which is down in Texas, [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2154.88s)]
*  as opposed to in Washington, DC, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2157.7200000000003s)]
*  where almost all the district court judges are lefties, [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2159.8s)]
*  and clearly the ACLU, which commenced this action, [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2162.92s)]
*  was looking for a leftist judge, and they got one. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2165.1600000000003s)]
*  Yes, Boesberg was originally appointed to the bench [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2167.48s)]
*  years ago for a DC court judge [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2169.7599999999998s)]
*  by a Republican Bush, George W., [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2172.6s)]
*  but there's no question the guy's gone left. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2175.9599999999996s)]
*  What happened to Justice Souter happened to Boesberg. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2178.8799999999997s)]
*  He may have originally been liked by a Republican judge, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2183.0s)]
*  but there's a reason it was Barack Obama [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2185.68s)]
*  who elevated him to the federal district court judge. [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2187.56s)]
*  You just take a look at his rulings, [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2189.8399999999997s)]
*  take a look at his wife, take a look at, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2190.9599999999996s)]
*  who runs an abortion clinic, [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2192.3199999999997s)]
*  his daughter who appears to work for a group [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2194.2s)]
*  that helps illegals and gang members [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2197.68s)]
*  who are in this country illegally. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2200.68s)]
*  Okay, so anyway, he sided, not surprising, with the ACLU, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2201.72s)]
*  and now it's up on appeal [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2205.48s)]
*  to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2206.52s)]
*  and they hashed it out yesterday [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2207.96s)]
*  about whether Trump has obligations to these people [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2208.8799999999997s)]
*  before he puts them on these planes. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2212.64s)]
*  Anyway, that's where it stands now. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2214.24s)]
*  The DC Circuit will make its ruling soon. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2215.44s)]
*  Your take on all of this, because my first conclusion on it [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2217.56s)]
*  is politically, this is a no-lose situation [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2222.56s)]
*  for Donald Trump. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2226.3599999999997s)]
*  Walter? [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2228.68s)]
*  I agree. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2229.52s)]
*  First of all, who wants to be in charge of deciding [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2231.3999999999996s)]
*  that this trend to Agua member should be allowed to stay [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2235.2s)]
*  and then answering for it when he kills somebody? [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2238.52s)]
*  Is this a power that they really want, [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2241.72s)]
*  or is it just a way to frustrate Trump? [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2245.52s)]
*  Because it's a power that I would not take on myself. [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2247.8399999999997s)]
*  It's pretty risky. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2251.0s)]
*  Number two, alien combatants. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2252.3599999999997s)]
*  Well, we know they're aliens. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2255.04s)]
*  We know they're aliens, are they combatants? [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2256.44s)]
*  It is true that we live in a period of irregular warfare. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2258.76s)]
*  We have drug cartels that are obviously incredibly powerful [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2262.1600000000003s)]
*  and well-funded in the United States, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2267.2400000000002s)]
*  which originate outside the country. [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2269.76s)]
*  It's their contention that somehow the Venezuelan government [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2272.56s)]
*  had something to do with infiltrating these characters [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2276.0s)]
*  into the US. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2278.52s)]
*  That would qualify, I think, in the 21st century [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2281.84s)]
*  as a combatant. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2285.04s)]
*  We take people who aren't in uniform [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2286.44s)]
*  and we smuggle them into other countries [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2288.8s)]
*  hoping that they'll do things for us. [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2290.56s)]
*  They make claim that they're seeking asylum or not. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2292.48s)]
*  So far, Trump has taken this all on himself, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2296.36s)]
*  and now this judge is saying, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2298.68s)]
*  well, I wanna be responsible for it, [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2300.4s)]
*  but does he really do that? [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2303.68s)]
*  Is there a judiciary that really wants to sometimes allow [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2305.2s)]
*  these people to stay such that they commit further crimes? [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2311.48s)]
*  So in that sense, you're right. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2314.6s)]
*  It is a political win-win. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2316.48s)]
*  Be careful what you wish for in terms of this judge [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2318.48s)]
*  and whoever he might represent. [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2322.12s)]
*  It could be a hand grenade. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2325.12s)]
*  You'd share a point, Walter Jose Iberra, [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2327.72s)]
*  who is the guy who killed Lake and Riley. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2330.08s)]
*  He was let loose back out on the community in New York [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2332.4s)]
*  after committing two other crimes, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2336.12s)]
*  flown on the taxpayer's dime down to Georgia. [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2338.32s)]
*  This is a Venezuelan gang member of Tren de Aragua, [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2341.72s)]
*  and that's where he killed Lake and Riley, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2346.04s)]
*  who's the face and name of the very first bill [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2348.7999999999997s)]
*  that Trump signed into law cracking down on illegals. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2352.3999999999996s)]
*  Imagine if you're the judge, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2355.56s)]
*  if another Jose Iberra is on one of those two planes, [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2358.3199999999997s)]
*  that he literally tried to call back into US airspace [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2363.04s)]
*  after they'd already left, [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2365.9199999999996s)]
*  and now he's very angry that they didn't turn [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2367.7999999999997s)]
*  the planes around. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2369.3999999999996s)]
*  Imagine that you're responsible [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2370.2799999999997s)]
*  for bringing one of these guys back [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2373.0s)]
*  and another 22-year-old gets killed. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2374.64s)]
*  That's why I say politically, Matt, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2376.64s)]
*  whatever happens with the DC Circuit, [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2378.3199999999997s)]
*  this is well worth the fight in many ways for Trump. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2379.8399999999997s)]
*  Well, I'd push back a little bit on that. [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2385.08s)]
*  I think maybe the specific case, that's true, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2389.08s)]
*  but in a larger sense, I think the Democrats [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2392.3199999999997s)]
*  so completely destroyed their reputation [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2396.68s)]
*  as defenders of civil liberties [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2399.44s)]
*  in the last 10 to 15 years. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2402.52s)]
*  We're asking right now whether or not these Venezuelan, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2406.08s)]
*  you know, alleged Venezuelan gang members [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2410.52s)]
*  have due process rights. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2412.2799999999997s)]
*  And remember, Barack Obama assassinated an American citizen, [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2414.12s)]
*  Anwar Al-Awlaki, without any due process, [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2420.0s)]
*  based on a memo they essentially wrote to themselves [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2423.16s)]
*  saying that the due process didn't have to involve [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2426.92s)]
*  the defendant. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2428.48s)]
*  And, you know, going on- [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2430.52s)]
*  That would be the lowest level of due process one gets. [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2433.2000000000003s)]
*  That would be the very lowest. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2435.7200000000003s)]
*  It's a process, it just doesn't involve you, right? [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2437.88s)]
*  So that's kind of sad. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2440.32s)]
*  But Matt, this guy, this Boasberg was head [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2442.5600000000004s)]
*  of the FISA courts, if I understand correctly, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2446.6400000000003s)]
*  which is a form of due process that the defendants [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2449.1200000000003s)]
*  don't even know is going on. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2451.52s)]
*  Yes, exactly. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2453.32s)]
*  That's the classic- [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2454.6400000000003s)]
*  Jesus, however. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2455.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2457.2s)]
*  But, you know, but then from there, you know, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2458.84s)]
*  they did so much in the area of undercutting [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2460.76s)]
*  their traditional defense of, say, the First Amendment, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2465.36s)]
*  right? [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2468.4s)]
*  And the Sixth Amendment, they handed those issues [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2469.88s)]
*  to Donald Trump and, you know, JD Vance said [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2474.08s)]
*  it was the biggest difference between [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2477.32s)]
*  the Trump administration and Kamala Harris [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2479.12s)]
*  was their attitude towards, for instance, free speech. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2483.12s)]
*  Now, this isn't a speech issue, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2486.0s)]
*  but it is kind of a civil liberties issue. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2488.7999999999997s)]
*  It doesn't pertain to an American citizen. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2491.92s)]
*  But we've seen in recent years how a lot of these [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2494.48s)]
*  sort of civil liberties problems start on the periphery [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2498.7999999999997s)]
*  and work toward the middle. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2501.92s)]
*  And we end up talking about, you know, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2503.16s)]
*  the rights of Americans being violated. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2506.48s)]
*  And so I do worry about that a little bit. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2508.72s)]
*  But I do think, you know, Trump especially [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2511.8s)]
*  has to be careful to preserve the high ground [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2514.2400000000002s)]
*  on civil liberties issues, just because- [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2518.6400000000003s)]
*  There's definitely some screening going on [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2521.8s)]
*  because, first of all, there's a way [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2523.6800000000003s)]
*  Tom Homan found these people. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2524.84s)]
*  You know, they didn't just like, [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2526.2400000000002s)]
*  there's a reason Walter, Matt, and Megan [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2527.4s)]
*  were not targeted by Tom Homan. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2529.44s)]
*  He is doing his homework to figure out who is here, [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2532.1200000000003s)]
*  who's here illegally. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2534.4s)]
*  And they represented it to the court. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2535.76s)]
*  And forgive me, I don't know whether it's all or most [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2538.36s)]
*  of those who are on these planes had already had hearings. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2541.56s)]
*  They'd already had hearings determining [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2545.2s)]
*  that they needed to be deported. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2547.04s)]
*  So it's either all or most of these folks [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2548.6s)]
*  already had way more due process [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2550.6s)]
*  than they would be entitled to had they been caught, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2553.44s)]
*  you know, at the border pursuing to expedited removal [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2556.52s)]
*  under any president. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2560.56s)]
*  So, you know, there's that. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2562.08s)]
*  And, but here's the thing that Americans can't get past. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2563.92s)]
*  Tom Homan put it best, [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2567.56s)]
*  and I think this is what we're all wrestling with. [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2569.2s)]
*  Joe Biden opened the border [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2571.7999999999997s)]
*  and millions of very bad hombres crossed the southern border [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2573.92s)]
*  are in the United States right now [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2579.0s)]
*  and will kill, rape, and hurt our children, [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2580.96s)]
*  ourselves, our neighbors. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2585.3599999999997s)]
*  And we don't care. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2587.6s)]
*  I mean, I'm really at the point of like, get out, get out. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2588.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't really give a shit about your due process. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2591.92s)]
*  What due process did the rest of us have? [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2593.72s)]
*  Or as Tom Homan put it here in 27, listen. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2595.64s)]
*  What we've heard from lawyers representing [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2599.44s)]
*  some of these people is that they deny [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2601.8399999999997s)]
*  that they're members of this gang [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2604.3199999999997s)]
*  or either, you know, Trent de Aragua or MS-13. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2607.3199999999997s)]
*  Do they get a chance to prove that [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2611.12s)]
*  before you take them out of the country [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2612.8799999999997s)]
*  and put them in to a notorious prison in a country [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2614.8399999999997s)]
*  that they're not even from? [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2618.72s)]
*  I mean, do they have any due process at all? [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2620.44s)]
*  Look, due process. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2622.3999999999996s)]
*  What is Lake Eran's due process? [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2626.8399999999997s)]
*  What was Lake and Riley's due process? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2630.16s)]
*  That's very powerful, Matt. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2632.24s)]
*  No, I get it, absolutely. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2634.7599999999998s)]
*  And I get that people are frustrated. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2637.24s)]
*  It's just something to keep an eye on. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2639.56s)]
*  And I remember, you know, the invocation [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2641.3999999999996s)]
*  of the Alien Enemies Act, which is, you know, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2644.52s)]
*  not the most storied act in our history. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2646.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, there was frustration among conservatives [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2650.48s)]
*  when the Democrats started pulling out laws, [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2653.56s)]
*  like the Logan Act to go after Donald Trump. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2655.3199999999997s)]
*  Sometimes when you see presidents using ancient [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2658.88s)]
*  or exotic laws to execute policies in situations, [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2663.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, it can be a bit of a red flag. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2668.2400000000002s)]
*  That's all I think, as far as I'm concerned. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2669.8s)]
*  I just think it's a sign of our desperation. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2671.88s)]
*  You know, it's our desperation as a country [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2673.76s)]
*  to solve this problem that was not of Trump's creation. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2675.44s)]
*  He's been, it's this thing he ran on [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2678.36s)]
*  from the moment he came down the escalator, Walter. [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2680.8s)]
*  Like the immigrants, Mexico, they're not sending their best. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2682.6s)]
*  And he's trying to use an extraordinary law [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2687.16s)]
*  that is on the books and has been upheld [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2690.56s)]
*  by the US Supreme Court to help him [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2692.72s)]
*  in what I believe Trump genuinely believes is an invasion. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2695.32s)]
*  I believe Trump has a sincere belief in that. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2697.92s)]
*  I went back and forth about Andy McCarthy's legal position. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2700.56s)]
*  And I love Andy, rarely disagree with him, but I do here. [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2705.44s)]
*  Last week when the national review guys were on about how, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2709.12s)]
*  look, this is a law, it is on the books, [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2712.56s)]
*  it's been adjudicated and the court has said [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2715.12s)]
*  there's no judicial review of it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2717.36s)]
*  If a president makes a mistake, that's too bad. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2718.72s)]
*  There are certain things that are not for the courts [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2721.68s)]
*  to second guess the US president on. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2723.52s)]
*  And Andy was making the point on his own podcast this week. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2725.84s)]
*  Well, we didn't, he still had to provide due process [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2727.84s)]
*  George W. Bush in the war on terror [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2731.48s)]
*  when we were dealing with enemy combatants. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2733.92s)]
*  Well, no one invoked the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2735.68s)]
*  Nobody was citing this. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2738.92s)]
*  Like, I'm sorry, George W. didn't think of it and Trump did, [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2740.4s)]
*  but we're in a whole new world now. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2743.96s)]
*  Go ahead, Walter. [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2745.12s)]
*  Theater Roosevelt, I mean, excuse me, Franklin Roosevelt [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2746.84s)]
*  imprisoned many, many thousands of Japanese Americans [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2750.08s)]
*  merely on the basis of being of Japanese heritage. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2753.8s)]
*  They put them in concentration camps [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2756.84s)]
*  in places like Wyoming. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2758.6s)]
*  I don't know if that was under the authority [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2760.96s)]
*  of this Alien Combatants Act, [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2762.6s)]
*  but when people perceive themselves to be at war [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2764.32s)]
*  in some fashion, things change. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2767.52s)]
*  Tom Homan's is American's bouncer, okay? [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2769.76s)]
*  He has a very common sense approach [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2772.44s)]
*  that I think appeals to the electorate. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2774.8s)]
*  There are bad guys, my job as a big, tough dude [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2777.08s)]
*  is to get them the hell out of here [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2781.04s)]
*  so that you guys can enjoy yourselves and be safe. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2782.6800000000003s)]
*  So far, that's an understanding, [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2786.6800000000003s)]
*  a political understanding with the American people [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2788.8s)]
*  that the American people seem fine with [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2790.84s)]
*  and in fact supported in the election of Trump. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2793.2400000000002s)]
*  That the judiciary is volunteering [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2796.84s)]
*  to get in the middle of this [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2798.92s)]
*  may not be the smartest thing it's ever done [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2800.12s)]
*  because they're not only bringing scrutiny [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2802.64s)]
*  on themselves politically and on their families [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2805.0s)]
*  and their various potential conflicts of interest, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2808.2s)]
*  they're starting to create a debate in America [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2811.7599999999998s)]
*  about whether the judiciary should have the powers [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2814.44s)]
*  that it does. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2819.24s)]
*  Many of those powers are actually backed by Congress, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2820.24s)]
*  it turns out, in a practical way [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2823.04s)]
*  and they're going to become unpopular [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2826.4s)]
*  with their congressional sponsors very soon. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2828.4s)]
*  It's a very good point because look, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2832.12s)]
*  we are on really thin ice if ultimately Judge Boasberg, [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2835.96s)]
*  this will eventually go back down to him, [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2841.08s)]
*  does issue some attempted mandate [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2843.52s)]
*  that those people be pulled out of that El Salvadorian prison [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2847.96s)]
*  and returned to America. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2852.08s)]
*  There is no way the Trump administration [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2854.12s)]
*  is going to do that. [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2856.64s)]
*  And I think at some level, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2859.32s)]
*  while Judge Boasberg may not be fully thinking of this yet, [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2860.1600000000003s)]
*  Matt, the Supreme Court will be [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2863.04s)]
*  because Chief Justice Roberts knows better than anybody, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2864.96s)]
*  there's no police power behind the courts. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2869.6800000000003s)]
*  We abide by their rulings out of a sense of duty, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2873.32s)]
*  neighborliness, order, nationality, patriotism, [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2877.96s)]
*  and acceptance of a system [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2882.48s)]
*  where there is a separation of powers. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2884.6s)]
*  If there's too egregious an overreach, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2886.48s)]
*  and I don't support flouting the Supreme Court mandates [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2888.7200000000003s)]
*  in their laws for the record, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2892.04s)]
*  but I'm just saying Chief Justice Roberts knows better [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2893.8s)]
*  than anybody that if they issue an order as specific [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2896.76s)]
*  and as extraordinary as that to the sitting commander in chief, [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2899.88s)]
*  it could destroy the court's power. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2905.7200000000003s)]
*  In one ruling, it could completely destroy [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2908.8s)]
*  the Supreme Court. [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2911.44s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, possession is nine-tenths of the law, right? [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2913.36s)]
*  And it reminds me of an old story about Joseph Stalin, [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2915.8s)]
*  who apparently he was criticized by the Pope for something. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2920.8s)]
*  And he essentially said, well, screw the Pope, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2925.1200000000003s)]
*  how many divisions does he have? [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2927.92s)]
*  And that comes into play here, [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2930.2000000000003s)]
*  that came into play when there was a famous case [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2933.52s)]
*  involving Abraham Lincoln in the beginning of the Civil War, [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2935.32s)]
*  where it also came into play. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2938.08s)]
*  The courts in these kinds of showdowns [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2940.92s)]
*  tend not to have the upper hand, [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2944.12s)]
*  and that might play out that way. [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2946.64s)]
*  And they know it. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2949.16s)]
*  So it's like, okay, it's one thing to say, [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2950.0s)]
*  those you now have in custody [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2953.16s)]
*  have to be provided the following screening, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2955.0s)]
*  this bare minimum of so-called due process. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2958.0s)]
*  But the odds of them getting back, [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2960.48s)]
*  those people in El Salvador are very thin, slim. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2962.44s)]
*  And by the way, Trump did return a guy from Nicaragua [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2965.0s)]
*  and a woman who had erroneously both been put on those flights [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2969.84s)]
*  when they had meant only to get these Venezuelan gang members. [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2973.5600000000004s)]
*  So it's not like there's been no screening [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2977.44s)]
*  or no double checking of what Homan is doing. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2979.2400000000002s)]
*  They're making sure it's just how much scrutiny [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2981.6800000000003s)]
*  are they entitled to. [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2985.0s)]
*  There's a couple of additional points on this [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2986.48s)]
*  that I do want to get to. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2987.96s)]
*  I do have to take a quick break, [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2988.8s)]
*  so I'm going to do this commercial. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2989.84s)]
*  And then we'll come back, [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2991.4s)]
*  because we got to talk about what John Harwood, [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2992.2400000000002s)]
*  formerly of CNN, tweeted out about this, among other things. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2995.0s)]
*  Stand by. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2997.8s)]
*  Walter and Matt, stay with me. [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=2999.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay, so you're thinking about what to get that person [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3002.8s)]
*  who has everything, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3004.92s)]
*  or maybe you are that person that has everything, [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3005.84s)]
*  and you just happen to appreciate the finer things. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3008.0400000000004s)]
*  Well, you want something really special? [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3010.4s)]
*  I've got it. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3012.44s)]
*  It's called Hot Salt. [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3013.36s)]
*  Yes, Hot Salt, exquisite, savory heat. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3014.48s)]
*  Now you're interested, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3017.92s)]
*  so let me tell you about Firecracker Farm. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3018.76s)]
*  It's a wonderful little family company [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3020.6800000000003s)]
*  that makes Hot Salt, a delightful spice-infused sea salt. [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3022.4s)]
*  It has the perfect amount of heat, [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3027.2s)]
*  an amazing flavor that makes everything taste better. [[00:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3028.92s)]
*  Word's getting out, and people are loving it. [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3031.8399999999997s)]
*  That is because it's made with love. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3034.72s)]
*  People can feel it and taste it. [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3036.16s)]
*  It's a small batch family operation, so supplies are limited. [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3038.04s)]
*  These things flew off the shelf over Christmastime. [[00:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3041.16s)]
*  It comes in sleek stainless steel push grinders. [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3043.96s)]
*  Plus you can take them anywhere. [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3047.3999999999996s)]
*  When you run out, they have refills for you. [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3049.0s)]
*  A little too spicy? [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3051.48s)]
*  You just mix it in with some regular sea salt [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3052.56s)]
*  to tame the heat, but you won't need to. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3054.8399999999997s)]
*  It is blended to perfection. [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3056.96s)]
*  Honestly, it's the best thing to happen to food since fire. [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3058.52s)]
*  So what are you waiting for? [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3061.68s)]

*  That's firecracker.farm, code MK. [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3068.2s)]
*  Get some Hot Salt before it's all gone. [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3071.44s)]
*  You'll thank me. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3073.76s)]
*  Okay, guys, so we are talking about what Tom Homan said, [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3075.7200000000003s)]
*  what Trump is doing, [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3081.28s)]
*  and whether this is a political winner for him, [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3082.36s)]
*  irrespective of what happens at the courts. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3084.92s)]
*  This would help. [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3089.08s)]
*  This would help Tom, I mean, Trump, as John Harwood, [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3089.92s)]
*  former White House correspondent for CNN, [[00:51:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3094.56s)]
*  worked for the New York Times, NBC, and so on. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3098.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay, tweets out the following. [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3101.88s)]
*  Tom Homan is like an early 20th century Southern sheriff [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3103.7200000000003s)]
*  who would send a mob to find a black kid [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3108.7200000000003s)]
*  who had allegedly looked the wrong way at a white woman. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3111.4s)]
*  The mob would bring back a kid [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3115.2s)]
*  who kind of sort of fit the description, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3116.64s)]
*  and the Homan character would say, [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3118.72s)]
*  string him up with an exclamation point. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3120.72s)]
*  That is where he went with Tom Homan asking [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3124.24s)]
*  where was Lake and Riley's due process, Walter? [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3129.96s)]
*  Thoughts on that? [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3132.96s)]
*  Well, I'm an actual novelist unlike Harwood, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3135.04s)]
*  so I'll give my competing image of Tom Homan. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3137.68s)]
*  I'm a bouncer in a very big nightclub [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3141.6s)]
*  and find some guys who've been harassing women [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3144.7599999999998s)]
*  in the women's bathroom and kicks them out the back door, [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3147.88s)]
*  and when they wanna come back in the front door, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3151.88s)]
*  doesn't allow it. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3155.64s)]
*  That is just a pure cheap shot on Harwood's part [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3157.24s)]
*  to act as though this is racist, [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3160.96s)]
*  that it harks back to the Southern past and so on. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3164.16s)]
*  Doesn't apply in any respect. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3168.24s)]
*  It's a bad image, a bad metaphor, [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3170.52s)]
*  and it's prejudicial on its face. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3172.56s)]
*  He can say it, but it doesn't mean much. [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3176.32s)]
*  But this is a window into how a lot of these leftists [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3179.92s)]
*  view the issue of deportations [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3183.52s)]
*  and of closing the border, Matt. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3185.68s)]
*  I mean, it's ridiculous. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3188.88s)]
*  First of all, how many times are these people [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3190.24s)]
*  gonna invoke Jim Crow? [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3192.88s)]
*  You know, everything is either Jim Crow or Hitler, basically, [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3196.2000000000003s)]
*  since Trump arrived on the political scene. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3201.4s)]
*  The other thing I'll say is, [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3203.84s)]
*  you know, I was a foreigner for 12 years. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3205.8s)]
*  I lived in the former Soviet Union. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3208.6000000000004s)]
*  I lived in a number of different countries, [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3210.1200000000003s)]
*  principally Russia, but also Uzbekistan, [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3212.04s)]
*  Mongolia, some other places, [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3214.84s)]
*  and you never have a sense that you have rights [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3216.8s)]
*  to a place as a foreigner. [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3222.32s)]
*  You always think of yourself as a guest. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3224.6s)]
*  You always wanna be on your best behavior, [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3226.4s)]
*  and you always wanna respect the culture [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3228.6800000000003s)]
*  to try to learn the language, do all those things. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3230.28s)]
*  And the idea that you can be thrown out of the country [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3232.76s)]
*  at any moment is present in your mind at all times. [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3236.96s)]
*  I mean, I was thrown out of Uzbekistan, [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3240.48s)]
*  and they had every right to do that. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3243.08s)]
*  What'd you do? [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3243.92s)]
*  I was there on the wrong kind of visa, [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3246.08s)]
*  and yeah, I was actually playing [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3247.8s)]
*  for an Uzbek baseball team at the time, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3250.8s)]
*  and they threw me out after practice. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3252.88s)]
*  But look, the idea that all these people, [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3255.52s)]
*  you know, as much of a civil libertarian as I am, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3259.76s)]
*  the idea that foreigners are the people [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3262.96s)]
*  who are here illegally have the same rights as Americans, [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3265.1600000000003s)]
*  this isn't true. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3268.44s)]
*  They may have, by law, they may have the same speech rights [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3269.36s)]
*  once they get here, but the notion [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3272.84s)]
*  that the president doesn't have the ability [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3276.04s)]
*  to throw these people out of the country, [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3277.4s)]
*  doesn't hold up, I don't think. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3280.1600000000003s)]
*  It's absurd. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3282.08s)]
*  And here's the interesting thing about this. [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3282.92s)]
*  Americans are actually really kind [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3287.16s)]
*  and nurturing and welcoming, and they're caretakers. [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3290.08s)]
*  I think they have a natural tendency to be caretakers. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3295.16s)]
*  And so that whole give us your tired, your poor, [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3297.88s)]
*  and all that, that works on the Statue of Liberty. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3300.36s)]
*  It worked on us for hundreds of years, [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3302.48s)]
*  and it worked on us all the way up to about four years ago [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3304.4s)]
*  when Joe Biden took it to a place [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3308.2s)]
*  no one had ever taken it to before [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3310.2s)]
*  and just opened the borders. [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3312.16s)]
*  I mean, it was just absolutely dangerous what he did. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3314.2799999999997s)]
*  It was absolutely, it was treasonous. [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3317.3999999999996s)]
*  That's how it feels, truly. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3320.9199999999996s)]
*  I don't throw that term around loosely, [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3322.08s)]
*  but the jeopardy that he put us all in [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3324.2s)]
*  and the lives that have been caused from that decision, [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3327.04s)]
*  there's just no question he should be held accountable [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3331.0s)]
*  in any event. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3334.2799999999997s)]
*  And so the American public have had it. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3336.64s)]
*  They've had it with this debate. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3338.2799999999997s)]
*  The Democrats have lost it. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3340.24s)]
*  It's one of the reasons why their party [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3341.52s)]
*  is in the toilet right now on its approval ratings. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3343.24s)]
*  So the American public is behind Trump [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3346.08s)]
*  on this issue above all others, [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3348.3199999999997s)]
*  well, this and the trans issue. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3350.6s)]
*  They're really behind Trump. [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3352.04s)]
*  And this is why I asked my team to pull this clip. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3353.72s)]
*  Now, hold on, I'm gonna set this up. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3358.56s)]
*  I saw a really interesting tweet thread, whatever, [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3360.96s)]
*  post thread on X a couple of weeks ago, maybe a month ago. [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3365.04s)]
*  I'm forgiving, I don't remember who started it, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3370.68s)]
*  but the guy was saying, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3372.3599999999997s)]
*  post here pictures or clips of people [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3375.2s)]
*  who are portrayed as villains in movies [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3378.48s)]
*  who you now no longer think are, right? [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3382.52s)]
*  With like just the dramatic changes [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3386.4399999999996s)]
*  that have happened in our country [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3388.3999999999996s)]
*  over the past 10 to 20 plus years. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3389.3599999999997s)]
*  Who do you now see who was depicted so poorly in film [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3391.3599999999997s)]
*  as not a villain who you were told was? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3395.0s)]
*  And this was one that I was like, [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3398.04s)]
*  oh my God, this is so true. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3399.96s)]
*  It's not directly related to immigration, [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3402.2000000000003s)]
*  but you'll get it. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3404.76s)]
*  It's this guy. [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3406.16s)]
*  You want answers? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3408.6800000000003s)]
*  I think I'm entitled. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3409.76s)]
*  You want answers? [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3410.7200000000003s)]
*  I want the truth. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3411.96s)]
*  You can't handle the truth. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3413.16s)]
*  Son, we live in a world that has walls [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3416.6s)]
*  and those walls have to be guarded by men with guns. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3418.48s)]
*  Who's gonna do it? [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3421.16s)]
*  You, you Lieutenant Weinberg. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3422.16s)]
*  I have a greater responsibility than you can possibly fathom [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3425.8s)]
*  and my existence while grotesque [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3429.0s)]
*  and incomprehensible to you saves lives. [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3430.92s)]
*  You don't want the truth because deep down in places, [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3435.04s)]
*  you don't talk about it, parties. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3437.2400000000002s)]
*  You want me on that wall. [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3439.2000000000003s)]
*  You need me on that wall. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3441.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3445.2400000000002s)]
*  And I don't really care if you have to give a few code reds [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3446.28s)]
*  to do it, Tom Homan, Colonel Jessup. [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3449.48s)]
*  I mean, I kind of think Walter, [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3452.08s)]
*  we're all Colonel Jessup now, [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3455.7200000000003s)]
*  or at least in the mood for Colonel Jessup. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3456.88s)]
*  Listen, I grew up with Dirty Harry [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3460.32s)]
*  and Charles Bronson movies. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3462.76s)]
*  We haven't even gotten close to that level yet. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3464.4s)]
*  You know, in the early and mid 70s, [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3467.2000000000003s)]
*  after the chaos of the 60s and the early 70s, [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3470.0s)]
*  we had a series of heroes. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3474.28s)]
*  Buford Pusser, the Southern Sheriff, [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3476.44s)]
*  speaking of Southern Sheriffs, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3478.32s)]
*  walking tall who went around with a baseball bat, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3479.48s)]
*  getting rid of all the scumbag. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3482.0s)]
*  Yeah, in his small town. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3483.88s)]
*  We had a decade of vigilante movies [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3486.96s)]
*  where people practically stood up and cheered. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3489.96s)]
*  And in one of those Dirty Harry's movies, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3493.2400000000002s)]
*  it's interesting, there was a villain [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3495.2400000000002s)]
*  who ends up kidnapping school children, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3496.88s)]
*  who is let off earlier in the movie by a judge [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3499.0s)]
*  on a technicality, even though they have him, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3501.88s)]
*  and then does even worse things. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3504.48s)]
*  So America's in that mood and cultural cycles, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3507.56s)]
*  you know, as Andrew Breitbart said, [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3511.28s)]
*  politics is downstream of culture. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3513.44s)]
*  And I think in a lot of cases, that's true. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3515.04s)]
*  In terms of cultural cycles, we're in a Tom Homan cycle, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3517.2400000000002s)]
*  not a, you know, Tom Cruise, upright Boy Scout cycle. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3520.04s)]
*  No, Lieutenant Weinberg, your time is up. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3526.52s)]
*  We are over the soft leadership stuffed [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3529.56s)]
*  into a military outfit without ever having done [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3533.32s)]
*  a three mile run. [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3536.64s)]
*  We need the Jessops of the world right now, Matt. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3537.76s)]
*  And, you know, I don't know what's gonna happen [[00:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3541.4s)]
*  with the trend to Aragwa gang deportations. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3543.2400000000002s)]
*  I certainly hope the Trump administration wins this, [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3546.36s)]
*  but let's just say they get their hands slapped [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3549.36s)]
*  by some court. [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3551.64s)]
*  It doesn't matter. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3553.76s)]
*  It's all worth it. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3554.6800000000003s)]
*  There, we're setting up the protocols, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3555.6800000000003s)]
*  like how far can Trump push it to get rid of these people [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3557.6s)]
*  that Joe Biden let in. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3560.96s)]
*  And it's the same thing as like the signal gate [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3562.28s)]
*  that we kicked the show off with. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3564.52s)]
*  For the Democrats who said nothing [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3566.2000000000003s)]
*  about the floodgates being opened, [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3569.2400000000002s)]
*  I have almost no tolerance for their objections [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3572.28s)]
*  in how we now get rid of these people. [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3574.2000000000003s)]
*  You know, you've lost your moral standing [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3576.2400000000002s)]
*  to complain about any of it. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3580.1600000000003s)]
*  You caused this entire problem, [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3582.1200000000003s)]
*  which Trump is now trying to fix [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3585.0800000000004s)]
*  and the country wants desperately to fix. [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3587.0s)]
*  Yeah, and just to go back to, you're absolutely right. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3591.6000000000004s)]
*  And to go back to the John Harwood thing, [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3594.32s)]
*  the reason that comparison is so obscene [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3598.76s)]
*  is because the young black men [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3602.1600000000003s)]
*  who were rounded up during the Jim Crow period, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3605.5600000000004s)]
*  they were citizens. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3608.2000000000003s)]
*  They had rights that were ignored and abused [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3610.4s)]
*  during that time. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3614.96s)]
*  They should have shared full equal rights [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3615.88s)]
*  because they were Americans, just like us. [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3618.7200000000003s)]
*  Apple's the orange's thing [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3623.7200000000003s)]
*  to compare these two situations. [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3625.36s)]
*  To claim that these suspected gang members [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3629.68s)]
*  are like abused American citizens just isn't true. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3633.88s)]
*  And you're right, they've lost all standing [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3639.0s)]
*  to complain about this like they have on speech issues. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3641.6s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3646.72s)]
*  I have one last point, Megan. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3647.88s)]
*  One of the reasons that Americans in general [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3649.48s)]
*  are so exercised about this issue [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3652.2s)]
*  is that they see it in the streets, at home, [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3654.36s)]
*  and around them. [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3658.04s)]
*  In other words, an insulated federal judge is one thing. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3659.2000000000003s)]
*  But when you're driving down the street [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3662.2000000000003s)]
*  and you see indigent people [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3664.44s)]
*  or what look like troublemakers, [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3667.2400000000002s)]
*  or if you go to the gym and you undress [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3669.6s)]
*  and the guy next to you has a tattoo [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3671.44s)]
*  of bloody death on his back, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3673.7200000000003s)]
*  or if you come across these gang members in any setting, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3676.48s)]
*  you're gonna be scared. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3682.2400000000002s)]
*  You're gonna be frightened. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3683.68s)]
*  It's an existential issue for everyday Americans, [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3684.68s)]
*  especially working class Americans [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3687.56s)]
*  who mix in the kind of places that these people hang out. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3689.3599999999997s)]
*  So they have a completely different perspective on this. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3693.0s)]
*  And of course the media wants us to believe [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3696.7999999999997s)]
*  that they're all these like sweet asylum seeking good people [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3698.8399999999997s)]
*  who just want a better life in America. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3702.12s)]
*  And that's baloney. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3704.6s)]
*  I mean, yes, there's some portion [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3706.3599999999997s)]
*  and we do have asylum processes that would allow those folks [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3707.7599999999998s)]
*  if they enter through a port of entry to claim asylum. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3710.7999999999997s)]
*  But it's been so abused that right now everything's paused. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3713.92s)]
*  Right now it's just, you know, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3717.2000000000003s)]
*  we gotta stop the bleeding before we can decide [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3718.36s)]
*  whether anybody else gets to come in. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3722.32s)]
*  It's like the sign held up by Homer Simpson, [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3724.36s)]
*  go home, the country's full. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3727.44s)]
*  That's how, that's the mood right now, [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3729.4s)]
*  mood as the kids say. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3731.44s)]
*  Okay, we've got to talk about the media [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3734.6400000000003s)]
*  because it's not just John Harwood with his sins. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3736.32s)]
*  Do you guys listen to The Daily, [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3741.76s)]
*  the New York Times podcast, it's called The Daily [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3743.44s)]
*  and it's on daily. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3746.56s)]
*  I do. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3747.4s)]
*  I do it for you, Matt. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3748.92s)]
*  I do it so you don't have to. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3750.4s)]
*  Same thing with The View [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3751.96s)]
*  and Meghan Markle's dumb Netflix special. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3753.0800000000004s)]
*  I'm a giver like that, you guys. [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3756.7200000000003s)]
*  So The Daily today. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3758.6400000000003s)]
*  I watched the Markle thing. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3759.48s)]
*  You did? [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3761.88s)]
*  What? [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3762.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, it just, it's like a horror movie exercise. [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3763.56s)]
*  But anyway. [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3766.52s)]
*  We're gonna have to do a part two on that [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3767.52s)]
*  with Matt Taibbi. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3770.6800000000003s)]
*  Maureen, bad news, you're out. [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3771.52s)]
*  Matt Taibbi's in. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3772.92s)]
*  Okay. [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3774.7200000000003s)]
*  So today they had on, [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3776.6800000000003s)]
*  and I really like Jim Rutenberg, I have to say. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3778.88s)]
*  He's a good guy, but he's a lefty [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3781.2000000000003s)]
*  and everything he writes or says comes from that perspective. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3783.2400000000002s)]
*  So that's just the way it is. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3786.2400000000002s)]
*  He used to be The Times critic, like media critic. [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3787.32s)]
*  And he's profiled me a couple of times. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3790.56s)]
*  That's how I got to know him. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3793.2400000000002s)]
*  Anyway, I think he's a sweet guy, [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3795.1200000000003s)]
*  but this is his worldview, right? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3796.48s)]
*  He comes on to talk to the host. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3798.96s)]
*  I think it was Michael Barbaro today. [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3803.4s)]
*  And yeah, it was. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3805.16s)]
*  And they were talking about the state of the media [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3806.68s)]
*  under Trump and how horrifying it is. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3809.32s)]
*  They're horrified about how Trump seems [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3814.2s)]
*  to have taken over media. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3819.44s)]
*  I'm just gonna give you a few samples of this. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3822.92s)]
*  There's so much to choose from. [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3824.32s)]
*  I guess I'll start. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3825.28s)]
*  What do you think, Steve? [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3826.12s)]
*  Sot 10, you guys pick your fave [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3826.96s)]
*  because we have a bunch that we love. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3828.7599999999998s)]
*  Watch. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3830.7999999999997s)]
*  The echoes to that moment, to that period in time, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3831.7999999999997s)]
*  are so loud in these early days [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3836.68s)]
*  of the new Trump administration, strikingly so. [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3839.6s)]
*  He's going after the press in ways that are very similar [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3842.7999999999997s)]
*  to the ways Nixon did, but he's going farther [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3846.2s)]
*  than Nixon did already in just the first couple months. [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3849.52s)]
*  At the same time, he's completely able to make an end run [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3853.32s)]
*  around the press, around its journalistic narratives, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3858.2400000000002s)]
*  to this huge new media sphere that will present the world [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3863.36s)]
*  only on the terms that Trump once had presented on. [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3869.6800000000003s)]
*  And that is something that Nixon could have only dreamed of. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3873.5600000000004s)]
*  What would it be like? [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3879.2000000000003s)]
*  That's ridiculous. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3880.76s)]
*  No, but what would it be like, Walter? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3882.24s)]
*  If only the Democrats have to look at Trump and think, [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3883.9599999999996s)]
*  gee, what would life be like if we had outlets [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3889.04s)]
*  that said what we want them to, [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3892.64s)]
*  that were just reliably in our corner and doing our bidding? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3895.2s)]
*  The New York Times, Walter, is asking this question [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3900.2799999999997s)]
*  as though they haven't been doing this for the Democrats [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3905.4799999999996s)]
*  since, well, at least the past 50, 40 years. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3909.08s)]
*  The New York Times has a hotline to the State Department, [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3913.08s)]
*  and it's probably got a hotline to the CIA. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3915.72s)]
*  It's got a hotline to every position of power. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3918.2s)]
*  It has taken dictation for decades and decades. [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3921.44s)]
*  But the premise here is so flawed. [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3925.84s)]
*  The idea that everybody is waiting for orders from Trump [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3928.08s)]
*  on independent media, the great thing [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3933.04s)]
*  about independent media now is that it's growing up [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3935.72s)]
*  from the grassroots, and Trump is coming down [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3938.4s)]
*  from the presidency, and they're meeting. [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3941.2000000000003s)]
*  And they're not meeting seamlessly. [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3943.44s)]
*  There's a lot of arguments. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3945.36s)]
*  I mean, conservatives, right-wingers, libertarians [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3946.76s)]
*  have as many ways to argue with each other [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3950.88s)]
*  and disagree with each other as the left does. [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3952.84s)]
*  But they also have something [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3955.32s)]
*  that the left doesn't have right now, which is authenticity. [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3956.84s)]
*  And they're trying to claim that this is a top-down phenomenon [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3959.84s)]
*  when it is absolutely the opposite. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3964.1600000000003s)]
*  That's so true. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3969.36s)]
*  Think about what happened just the other week. [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3970.2000000000003s)]
*  We showed the clip where it was Black History Day, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3971.84s)]
*  and Trump had the CEO of Pfizer, [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3975.7200000000003s)]
*  among others, at the White House. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3978.52s)]
*  And Trump was like, hey, the CEO of Pfizer! [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3980.36s)]
*  And this is the ardent Trump faithful at the White House, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3982.84s)]
*  where they were like, boo, boo! [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3986.0s)]
*  Trump, it is bottom-up. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3988.44s)]
*  They love Trump, but he doesn't control them. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3991.12s)]
*  They have their own strong feelings on the right [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3994.56s)]
*  about him, his policies, who they're gonna applaud, [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3996.88s)]
*  who they're gonna boo. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=3999.52s)]
*  But before I get you to weigh in, Matt, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4001.2000000000003s)]
*  I gotta get in some of this other sound, [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4002.52s)]
*  because it's all so delicious. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4003.7200000000003s)]
*  There's more of the same point being made [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4004.6800000000003s)]
*  in a discussion about X. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4006.76s)]
*  Listen here. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4009.04s)]
*  If you open up X, what used to be Twitter, [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4010.84s)]
*  under Elon Musk, and now in the era of Donald Trump, [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4014.56s)]
*  you experience something very different [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4017.84s)]
*  than what you did a couple years ago. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4021.1600000000003s)]
*  Whether it's Elon Musk himself [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4024.32s)]
*  coming on to praise President Trump, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4026.08s)]
*  or a bunch of conservative accounts I had never followed, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4028.16s)]
*  suddenly are very prominent on my feed. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4032.24s)]
*  But very much it now feels like a daily megaphone [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4036.36s)]
*  for Trump and the entire MAGA movement. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4040.44s)]
*  That's a big deal for Trump, because it's, as you note, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4042.84s)]
*  these are Trumpian narratives that take over the platform [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4045.6s)]
*  and support whatever he's saying that day. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4048.2799999999997s)]
*  Suddenly, one of the most important, [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4050.72s)]
*  widely used social media platforms in the country, [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4052.7599999999998s)]
*  which is not the world, is being managed for the president. [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4056.7200000000003s)]
*  But it's its own media sphere, [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4062.48s)]
*  and it's emerged in this entirely new way, [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4064.52s)]
*  and that's this world of male-dominated media. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4067.28s)]
*  Okay, Matt, X was completely controlled by leftists [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4072.04s)]
*  since its iterations, since it was first born [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4079.52s)]
*  till two years ago, right? [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4082.4s)]
*  Facebook, same, Zuckerberg's had a new sort of revelation [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4084.56s)]
*  that he's, I guess, more right-leaning than we knew. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4087.88s)]
*  But Facebook has been completely left-leaning, [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4089.96s)]
*  at least in its core politics. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4093.16s)]
*  Go down the list, all the social media, right? [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4096.48s)]
*  Where's the discussion on how threads and blue sky [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4099.08s)]
*  are just democratic echo chambers now? [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4102.4s)]
*  Not to mention outside of social media, actual media, [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4105.2s)]

*  is entirely controlled by leftists. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4111.84s)]
*  So, Megan, this is my favorite question [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4116.16s)]
*  that you've ever asked me. [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4119.16s)]
*  Jim Rutenberg, the irony of this is astounding. [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4121.88s)]
*  Jim Rutenberg, in August of 2016, [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4125.400000000001s)]
*  wrote an extraordinarily influential article [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4129.68s)]
*  called Trump is Testing the Norms of Objectivity [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4132.88s)]
*  in Journalism, and the entire argument of the piece [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4135.92s)]
*  was that Trump was such an extreme threat [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4139.88s)]
*  that journalists had to change the way they did business. [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4142.56s)]
*  We no longer had to be just true, [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4145.72s)]
*  we had to be true to quote, history's judgment, right? [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4147.92s)]
*  So it was a clarion call for the entire mainstream media [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4151.32s)]
*  to change its they did this, they did that, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4156.32s)]
*  we don't really care, you sort of doubt attitude [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4159.4400000000005s)]
*  to let's become activists, let's tell you [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4162.56s)]
*  which is the right thing and who is the villain [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4165.92s)]
*  and who isn't, and let's become narrative driven [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4168.52s)]
*  in your face politicized media, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4172.64s)]
*  which has lost all credibility with audiences. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4175.360000000001s)]
*  Now, when he says that Trump can circumvent [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4178.6s)]
*  journalistic narratives and go directly to the people, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4181.72s)]
*  he's absolutely right, but that is a market contest, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4185.56s)]
*  a free market contest of believability [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4190.64s)]
*  where the mainstream media is losing [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4193.400000000001s)]
*  because it's screwed up so many stories [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4195.72s)]
*  in pursuit of trying to preserve [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4198.04s)]
*  these politicized narratives. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4200.8s)]
*  They've made so many horrific factual errors [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4202.24s)]
*  and gone over the deep end so many times [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4205.6s)]
*  that people trust the Joe Rogan's [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4208.76s)]
*  and Megan Kelly's of the world far more than they do [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4211.16s)]
*  the Jim Rutenberg's of the world. [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4214.64s)]
*  He, Jim Rutenberg created this situation [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4216.88s)]
*  that he's lamenting, it's extraordinarily ironic. [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4220.88s)]
*  Hashtag part of the problem, I'll give you one more, [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4224.76s)]
*  stop 14 again, back to Nixon. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4227.4800000000005s)]
*  So to go back to Nixon for just a moment, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4230.400000000001s)]
*  what he wanted by your account most [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4234.64s)]
*  was to somehow get around journalists like Walter Cronkite [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4237.6s)]
*  who he was so frustrated with [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4243.24s)]
*  and so frustrated that he couldn't get around. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4244.4400000000005s)]
*  With Trump, that dynamic has been kind of inverted, right? [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4246.4800000000005s)]
*  Trump doesn't have to go around the mainstream media. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4251.599999999999s)]
*  This new Trumposphere in the media [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4256.0s)]
*  is already working with him and for him. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4259.919999999999s)]
*  And in that sense, Trump doesn't even need [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4264.44s)]
*  the mainstream media. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4267.599999999999s)]
*  Walter, this is so crazy. [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4270.959999999999s)]
*  That's called the internet. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4272.32s)]
*  That's called the internet, okay? [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4273.4s)]
*  But do you tell me, has there been a modern president [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4275.28s)]
*  who's made himself more accessible [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4280.4s)]
*  to the mainstream media than this one? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4282.96s)]
*  He has them in every day and lets them do a gaggle [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4285.8s)]
*  or holds a presser. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4290.24s)]
*  He takes questions from all of them. [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4291.2s)]
*  He gets annoyed at one or the other like the AP [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4292.92s)]
*  and says, all right, you no longer be in pool. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4295.28s)]
*  He takes questions from all of them. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4297.12s)]
*  When he ran, he went on Theo Vaughn, [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4299.12s)]
*  he did Joe Rogan, he did Sean Ryan. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4301.5199999999995s)]
*  He's not talking to those guys now. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4304.32s)]
*  They're not breaking news on Trump. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4305.84s)]
*  He's talking only right now to these mainstream media [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4307.4s)]
*  and they're still mad that the others exist. [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4311.04s)]
*  First of all, the reason that they can't adapt on the left [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4316.92s)]
*  is that they have an orthodox religion [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4320.679999999999s)]
*  which won't allow them to get over certain catechisms. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4323.28s)]
*  Nixon, Jim Crow, et cetera. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4328.759999999999s)]
*  These have nothing to do with life in America 2025 right now. [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4331.32s)]
*  They're mourning a monopoly. [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4335.92s)]
*  They're mourning a period when there were three networks [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4337.8s)]
*  and basically three newspapers. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4340.6s)]
*  Now, they can't get over the fact that they've lost power, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4343.16s)]
*  that the internet goes from side to side, not the top down, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4347.52s)]
*  that it is indeed a net and that it's decentralized. [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4351.84s)]
*  The attempt in the last few years before Trump was elected [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4355.52s)]
*  and Elon took over Twitter was to make the internet [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4359.52s)]
*  and social media resemble that old monopoly. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4362.36s)]
*  They wanted to sit on top of it [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4365.36s)]
*  and use these academic misinformation organizations [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4367.32s)]
*  and state department sponsored disinformation organizations [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4372.04s)]
*  to curate it in a way that was really a losing battle [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4376.2s)]
*  in the modern age because the internet now is like water. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4380.0s)]
*  It can flow around you and it's not just Trump [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4383.32s)]
*  who can get his message out. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4385.839999999999s)]
*  It's all kinds of what characters [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4387.12s)]
*  that they would consider fringe. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4390.96s)]
*  We've entered a new age and the New York Times [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4393.76s)]
*  can't believe it's not still 1974 [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4396.280000000001s)]
*  and then invoking Nixon can't scare everybody [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4398.96s)]
*  from speaking up. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4402.4800000000005s)]
*  But if you either get with it, people in Jim Rutenberg, [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4404.92s)]
*  or you're gonna be left behind and you have been. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4408.8s)]
*  It's crazy because they talk about like, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4412.64s)]
*  they're so obsessed of course with Watergate. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4414.68s)]
*  And I grew up, I watched all the president's men. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4416.92s)]
*  It was one of the reasons I wanted to become a journalist, [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4420.8s)]
*  not because they took down a Republican, [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4423.0s)]
*  but because that was spoon fed to all of us for decades [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4424.88s)]
*  as like the ultimate example of journalism at its core. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4428.6s)]
*  Like risk it all, you're in danger, [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4434.36s)]
*  you're onto a great story. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4437.2s)]
*  Everything around you is being threatened, [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4439.04s)]
*  but you stay on it like a dog with a bone [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4440.52s)]
*  and then ultimately you take down a president. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4442.56s)]
*  It was a crazy story. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4444.88s)]
*  Only in retrospect do you look back and you're like, [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4447.0s)]
*  ah, that was the media doing what it does. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4449.48s)]
*  It's like trying to take down a Republican, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4451.8s)]
*  only this one they can't get to, Matt. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4454.4400000000005s)]
*  But it's the same thing that makes them like, [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4457.56s)]
*  he texted war plans to Jeffrey Goldberg. [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4459.76s)]
*  And Trump is the devil who won't speak [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4462.84s)]
*  to any mainstream media sources, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4466.0s)]
*  even though he does it literally every day. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4468.04s)]
*  His oxygen is speaking to any and all reporters, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4470.08s)]
*  but they won't see it. [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4474.68s)]
*  No, he's Nixon, he's gotta control them all [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4475.6s)]
*  or he won't give us access. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4477.84s)]
*  It's so funny to see their own bias [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4479.56s)]
*  just completely blind them [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4481.68s)]
*  to what's actually happening in front of them. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4484.04s)]
*  Not only the bias though, Megan, [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4487.92s)]
*  it's also just the wimpiness, [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4489.92s)]
*  the whining that oh my God, [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4493.080000000001s)]
*  the president can get around the journalistic narratives [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4495.4400000000005s)]
*  and get around the mainstream media. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4498.6s)]
*  You know how the press gets power [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4500.8s)]
*  by being good at what it does? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4502.8s)]
*  When you get a good story, when you break news, [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4505.4800000000005s)]
*  when you're a great investigative reporter like Cy Hersh, [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4508.4s)]
*  people listen to you. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4511.6s)]
*  It's like EF Hutton, you know? [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4513.72s)]
*  When you have good information, people listen. [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4516.0s)]
*  When you suck at your job, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4519.8s)]
*  like the people at the New York Times mostly have [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4521.92s)]
*  for quite a long time now, you lose audience. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4524.32s)]
*  And presidents like Donald Trump can get around you. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4527.12s)]
*  And you don't have the same influence that you have, [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4531.12s)]
*  you had in elections previously. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4533.92s)]
*  As a campaign reporter, I've been doing this for, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4536.4800000000005s)]
*  I guess since 2004, [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4539.76s)]
*  I covered five straight presidential elections [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4541.8s)]
*  and the press continually lost influence [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4544.52s)]
*  as people discovered that there were more sources [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4548.72s)]
*  out there on the internet that they trusted more [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4551.24s)]
*  because they got tired of hearing the same old canned stuff [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4553.64s)]
*  from reporters who were too friendly with politicians [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4557.16s)]
*  in both parties, but particularly with Democrats, [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4560.88s)]
*  and the fact that they get frozen out, it's their own fault. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4566.52s)]
*  It's their own fault for not working [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4570.360000000001s)]
*  and for not thinking about the audience first [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4572.04s)]
*  and not their political sponsors. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4576.320000000001s)]
*  I got another one, a follow-up with you on that, Matt. [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4578.320000000001s)]
*  Another piece of the broadcast today, their show, [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4581.64s)]
*  was about how he's doing this, right? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4584.12s)]
*  Going around the mainstream to these alternate sources. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4587.400000000001s)]
*  But secondly, he's cracking down on the mainstream. [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4592.2s)]
*  And they say the ABC News settlement [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4596.16s)]
*  for $15 million with him, which was required [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4598.679999999999s)]
*  because their lead political anchor [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4602.04s)]
*  repeatedly said Donald Trump had been found liable for rape, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4604.4s)]
*  which is defamatory and false. [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4609.4s)]
*  By any measure, as a lawyer and a journalist, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4612.839999999999s)]
*  I can tell you, we'd all be in deep shit [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4616.32s)]
*  if we said that, and it's not true about somebody. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4619.96s)]
*  Then they cite CBS because Trump filed this lawsuit [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4623.56s)]
*  against them for their editing of the Kamala Harris thing, [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4628.96s)]
*  which I already said in the show, [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4631.6s)]
*  I thought was bullshit, a bullshit case, [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4632.84s)]
*  but he's trying to rattle their cage a bit, [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4635.6s)]
*  and he filed it in Texas where they have more favorable laws [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4637.6s)]
*  on consumer fraud, et cetera, whatever. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4640.16s)]
*  He wound up getting that transcript produced, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4642.04s)]
*  and 60 Minutes was somewhat embarrassed. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4644.76s)]
*  It wasn't like the worst switcheroo of answering [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4646.72s)]
*  I've ever seen in my life, [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4648.96s)]
*  but they were somewhat embarrassed by, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4650.52s)]
*  it was clear they did run cover for Kamala, [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4652.52s)]
*  tried to make her look a little better than she did. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4654.28s)]
*  But the way they talked about it, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4657.12s)]
*  Matt, it was like, Rutenberg was like, [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4659.2s)]
*  and this is 60 Minutes, so he sued them, and they're caving. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4661.88s)]
*  CBS is caving, but you're talking about [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4666.88s)]
*  one of the most respected broadcasts in America, [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4670.52s)]
*  and they're still, they're still so hard-charging [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4674.76s)]
*  and tough at 60. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4678.76s)]
*  In no way was he recognizing what the rest of us see. [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4680.92s)]
*  It was just 60 is a shadow of its former self. [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4684.04s)]
*  It's a joke today versus when it had Murderers Row [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4686.6s)]
*  with Wallace and Bradley and the rest of them. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4690.52s)]
*  They just, they don't, they genuinely don't see it. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4692.8s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4697.92s)]
*  My father, who was a reporter, [[01:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4700.4400000000005s)]
*  used to tell me that you can learn, [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4703.0s)]
*  you don't need to go to journalism school, [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4705.4800000000005s)]
*  that you can learn it. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4706.76s)]
*  The basics of the job in two hours, [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4707.76s)]
*  but in those two hours, probably the first thing [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4710.56s)]
*  that they tell you when you start working in journalism [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4713.56s)]
*  is that the one thing that you cannot do [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4716.76s)]
*  is accuse somebody in print of a crime [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4719.360000000001s)]
*  that they have not been committed for. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4721.76s)]
*  That will get you sued 100 times out of 100. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4723.56s)]
*  And the ABC News case, you know, [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4727.0s)]
*  I understand the argument that you can construe that verdict. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4730.96s)]
*  I guess if you take a creative interpretation of it as rape, [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4736.72s)]
*  but it's not going to hold. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4741.88s)]
*  He wasn't convicted of rape [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4743.32s)]
*  and it wasn't a criminal case either. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4744.84s)]
*  The most you can say is sexual assault in that case. [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4748.56s)]
*  And he repeatedly said rape [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4751.08s)]
*  and he clearly knew what he was doing. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4752.4800000000005s)]
*  So that's why they settled. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4754.4s)]
*  In the 60 Minutes case, [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4756.52s)]
*  they settled because they did something embarrassing [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4758.16s)]
*  and they didn't want to get out. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4762.16s)]
*  And they're trying to merge. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4763.0s)]
*  They're trying to have a merger [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4764.16s)]
*  when they need government approval. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4765.2s)]
*  Right, exactly. [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4767.04s)]
*  And to your point about 60 Minutes [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4768.96s)]
*  falling from its great heights, [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4771.5599999999995s)]
*  Walter and I talked not that long ago [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4774.12s)]
*  about the 60 Minutes story about speech in Germany, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4775.84s)]
*  where they did this extraordinary segment, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4779.8s)]
*  sort of breathlessly showing how wonderful it was [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4782.96s)]
*  to live in a country where six armed cops burst [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4787.5599999999995s)]
*  into your door to arrest you for doing memes. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4790.92s)]
*  For insulting somebody. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4795.84s)]
*  Yeah, literally for an insult. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4797.52s)]
*  Not to mention the old, the laptop can't be verified. [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4800.28s)]
*  It can't be verified, Leslie Stahl. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4803.4s)]
*  Not to mention what Scott Pelley did [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4805.84s)]
*  with Moms for Liberty when they came on. [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4807.92s)]
*  There is no pornography being put [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4811.24s)]
*  in K through 12 education library books. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4813.24s)]
*  There is, Scott, there is. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4816.44s)]
*  It was just, there's so many examples. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4818.88s)]
*  60 is a joke to most of the country now, [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4820.8s)]
*  except these far lefties who still see it [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4823.92s)]
*  as the god of TV news. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4826.76s)]
*  It's just kind of fun, frankly, to see how out of touch [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4828.84s)]
*  some on the left are, Walter, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4833.4400000000005s)]
*  because it's like the whole world has moved past them [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4835.24s)]
*  and they're still, I said this once before, [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4838.64s)]
*  it's like we are all enjoying the fruits of our light bulb [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4840.76s)]
*  while they are trying to figure out [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4844.64s)]
*  what oil to put in the lantern. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4846.4400000000005s)]
*  Megan, they're on a nostalgia trip. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4849.88s)]
*  Right now on Broadway, George Clooney is playing Muro, okay? [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4852.16s)]
*  And good night and good luck. [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4857.16s)]
*  CBS can't get over its glory days. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4859.24s)]
*  New York Times can't get over its glory days, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4862.72s)]
*  but they all go back to the 70s. [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4865.4s)]
*  It's like when my father insisted on playing music [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4867.08s)]
*  from 1955 when he was a high school football player. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4869.72s)]
*  He just had to revisit it obsessively. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4873.5599999999995s)]
*  And going back to Nixon and other moments [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4876.8s)]
*  when they had the power that they lack now, [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4880.22s)]
*  it's not our fault that there's no Walter Cronkite. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4884.02s)]
*  It's theirs. [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4886.740000000001s)]
*  If they had someone as talented and trusted [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4887.58s)]
*  and charismatic and frankly, [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4889.9400000000005s)]
*  objective seeming as Cronkite, bring him forth. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4893.5s)]
*  I don't see it. [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4897.3s)]
*  By the way, I too am obsessed with the music [[01:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4899.860000000001s)]
*  that was on the radio during my high school [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4903.1s)]
*  and college years. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4904.9800000000005s)]
*  We recently went to a basketball game [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4906.18s)]
*  and I came out singing one of the songs that, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4908.42s)]
*  I love this song. [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4910.34s)]
*  And I admit to you, I never paused to ask myself, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4911.42s)]
*  what does this actually mean until my kids were like, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4915.02s)]
*  mom, do you know what that means? [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4918.46s)]
*  And that song was OPP. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4920.14s)]
*  Oh. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4922.82s)]

*  Yeah, you know me. [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4931.5s)]
*  And let's just say in the second verse, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4932.74s)]
*  he says something like, [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4934.5s)]
*  for the ladies, OPP means something different. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4935.82s)]
*  The first letter's the same, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4938.58s)]
*  but the last is something different. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4939.5s)]
*  Then he says something like, [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4940.58s)]
*  he won't say it, but he says something like, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4942.58s)]
*  it's other people's. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4944.5s)]
*  He says, I won't say it, [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4945.78s)]
*  but it rhymes with the leanest, the meanest. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4947.78s)]
*  Then I got it. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=4951.860000000001s)]

*  but she got on the Megyn Kelly show [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5283.3s)]
*  and being a rising star in the Democratic Party [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5285.58s)]

*  Right, we're gonna win. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5296.9400000000005s)]
*  We know you don't talk like that. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5298.54s)]
*  We hear you every day, the sitting vice president, [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5299.900000000001s)]
*  why are you talking like that? [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5301.620000000001s)]
*  Or whatever the accent was in front of the crowd. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5303.3s)]
*  But it's funny you should raise this point. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5307.26s)]
*  It's like we knew you were coming, Walter, [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5309.14s)]
*  because we got this from Ian Hayworth. [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5310.74s)]
*  He's a commentator online, clever. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5315.74s)]
*  And he put together a montage of Jasmine Crockett sounding [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5318.46s)]
*  like, I don't know, I guess her normal self [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5323.74s)]
*  versus her new accent, which she brings out [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5326.34s)]
*  when she's in front of the crowds [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5330.7s)]
*  and she wants to grip on Governor Hot Wheels [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5332.02s)]
*  and his wheelchair. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5334.42s)]
*  Take a listen to 17B. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5335.820000000001s)]
*  My mind, I'm thinking, I just got to Austin [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5337.9800000000005s)]
*  and I had to meet five people to get here. [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5341.22s)]
*  I don't know about this. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5344.26s)]
*  So y'all don't know what white privilege looks like, [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5345.580000000001s)]
*  but I'ma show you a little bit of something. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5347.38s)]
*  It's a huge responsibility. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5349.5s)]
*  I'ma show you. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5350.580000000001s)]
*  You know, the congressional seat is over four times [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5351.42s)]
*  as large as my house seat. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5354.06s)]
*  I'm trying to get clarification. [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5355.5s)]
*  Look it, calm down, calm down. [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5356.700000000001s)]
*  No, no, no, no, because this is what y'all do. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5358.46s)]
*  And I was just starting to get into the rhythm [[01:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5361.1s)]
*  of doing constituent services. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5362.9800000000005s)]
*  They send them to Texas, they send them to Florida. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5365.02s)]
*  Every deplorable state that we can think about, [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5367.3s)]
*  they usually coming out of y'all's think tank. [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5369.14s)]
*  There was someone that talked to me and said, [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5372.02s)]
*  in fact, a former ambassador [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5374.18s)]
*  and the Clinton administration. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5376.54s)]
*  Someone on this committee then starts talking [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5377.900000000001s)]
*  about somebody's bleach blonde, bad built butch body. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5380.9800000000005s)]
*  Okay, Matt, that was three years ago. [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5387.18s)]
*  The ones of her just sounding like a normal person talking. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5390.58s)]
*  Three years, sound like that was 20 years, [[01:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5393.78s)]
*  but then she moved to Mississippi for all that time. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5396.0199999999995s)]
*  That was three years ago. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5399.7s)]
*  She sounded like a totally normal person. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5400.98s)]
*  It's only now she's got her accent [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5403.3s)]
*  and she's going kick everybody's ass. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5405.62s)]
*  It's such an affectation. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5407.82s)]
*  So this is funny. [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5411.18s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett sits on the Jivishiary Committee [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5412.74s)]
*  and about a month, was it about a month ago, Walter? [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5415.7s)]
*  Oh yes, yes, we saw this. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5419.06s)]
*  Yeah, and the hearings, [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5422.26s)]
*  the full committee hearings are quite long. [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5425.700000000001s)]
*  You can be there for over four hours. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5428.740000000001s)]
*  So, and they let the most junior members ask questions last. [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5431.06s)]
*  So I had to sit for quite a long time. [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5436.3s)]
*  And then at the very end, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5439.9800000000005s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett, who I'd never heard before, [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5441.9400000000005s)]
*  suddenly started screaming at me and Michael Schellenberger. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5444.38s)]
*  And when you're a witness in Congress, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5448.18s)]
*  you have to pay attention to what everybody says [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5451.18s)]
*  because you never know when you're gonna be asked [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5453.14s)]
*  an actual question and allowed to, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5455.22s)]
*  maybe even allowed to speak. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5457.54s)]
*  But I could not understand what she was saying. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5459.38s)]
*  She was moving from one thing to another [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5461.46s)]
*  and she was doing all that code switching stuff [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5463.3s)]
*  with the y'alls and y'all lying on this and everything. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5466.18s)]
*  And then I went home to look her up [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5469.1s)]
*  and I found her talking like that online. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5470.780000000001s)]
*  I was like, what was that all about? [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5472.820000000001s)]
*  Like, and you know, it's, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5474.34s)]
*  not even a pretense of addressing any of the issues [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5478.46s)]
*  that we were there to talk about, like digital censorship. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5481.86s)]
*  It was just these people somehow represent the other side. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5484.099999999999s)]
*  She probably had no idea that, you know, [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5489.54s)]
*  I was a lifetime Democrat for her [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5491.3s)]
*  or had been most of the time. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5493.099999999999s)]
*  And it's just, that's what she does. [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5495.94s)]
*  She puts out this video of her acting in a certain way [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5498.099999999999s)]
*  and that's how she fund raises. [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5501.42s)]
*  We actually did a bit of a deep dive on her [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5503.54s)]
*  after my old colleague from Fox News, [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5507.7s)]
*  Todd Starnes posted something on X not long ago, Walter. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5510.18s)]
*  He posted the following, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5514.3s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett wants you to think she's from the hood, [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5515.94s)]
*  that she grew up on the streets. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5518.58s)]
*  The exact opposite is true. [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5520.06s)]
*  She attended an exclusive day school [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5521.34s)]
*  where tuition is nearly $35,000 a year. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5523.54s)]
*  She also attended Rhodes College, [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5526.46s)]
*  a private school where tuition is nearly $55,000 a year. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5528.26s)]
*  She's cosplaying a gangster. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5531.98s)]
*  So we looked up her background. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5534.9s)]
*  She was born in St. Louis, she's 43. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5536.58s)]
*  Her dad was a Baptist pastor and a teacher. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5539.66s)]
*  Her mother worked in a post office. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5542.24s)]
*  She graduated from Mary Institute [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5544.66s)]
*  and St. Louis Country Day School, [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5547.0599999999995s)]
*  one of the most expensive private schools in the city. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5549.459999999999s)]
*  Indeed, the current tuition $35,000 a year. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5551.62s)]
*  Got her bachelor's from Rhodes College in Memphis, Tennessee, [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5555.299999999999s)]
*  private liberal arts school, current tuition $55,000. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5558.82s)]
*  Then she moved to Texas and went to law school. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5564.259999999999s)]
*  Looks like she started [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5567.7s)]
*  at the Thurgood Marshall School of Law, [[01:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5568.54s)]
*  finished at the University of Houston Law Center. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5570.219999999999s)]
*  But while she was at Rhodes College in Memphis, [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5573.62s)]
*  the Tennessee Star reported this past May, [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5578.78s)]
*  almost a year ago now, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5582.48s)]
*  that she and other black students, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5584.299999999999s)]
*  she claimed in a 2020 interview, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5587.78s)]
*  were victims of multiple hate crimes in 2002 [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5590.82s)]
*  when she was a college student, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5595.9s)]
*  that she said, in my junior year, [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5597.46s)]
*  I became the victim of a series of hate crimes, [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5599.62s)]
*  a series of them, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5602.38s)]
*  myself along with a handful of other black students. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5603.78s)]
*  This is her claiming this in 2020 [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5606.42s)]
*  about her 2002 college experience. [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5608.42s)]
*  My school didn't know what to do. [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5610.94s)]
*  They brought in the Cochran law firm [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5611.94s)]
*  and the lawyer that helped me became my instant shero. [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5614.16s)]
*  They go on to say in 2021, [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5617.16s)]
*  she provided additional details [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5619.16s)]
*  of the alleged hate crimes to ABC7 [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5620.599999999999s)]
*  with the outlet reporting [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5623.0s)]
*  that she recalled needing an advocate [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5624.04s)]
*  when someone left racist hate mail in her campus mailbox [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5625.92s)]
*  and when her black friends had their cars keyed on campus. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5630.08s)]
*  The Tennessee Star contacted Rhodes College [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5635.16s)]
*  to seek details about the alleged hate crimes [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5637.7s)]
*  and whether police reports were filed [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5640.04s)]
*  and whether the Cochran law firm was actually retained. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5643.0s)]
*  The college did not respond. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5646.28s)]
*  An additional inquiry by the Star to the Cochran firm [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5648.52s)]
*  similarly did not receive an immediate response. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5652.24s)]
*  The Star sought confirmation from the firm [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5654.68s)]
*  about whether they even represented the college [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5658.2s)]
*  and the female attorney identified as the shero [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5660.0s)]
*  and didn't get any response. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5663.12s)]
*  And then before we went on the air today, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5666.0s)]
*  we followed up with the Star [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5668.16s)]
*  just to see if they ever got anything back [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5669.66s)]
*  and here's what they got from Crockett's office. [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5671.8s)]
*  They told the Star the racist mail was assembled [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5675.6s)]
*  using letters cut out of magazines and news payers, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5677.68s)]
*  but they say Crockett's office [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5682.0s)]
*  did not respond to an inquiry by the Star [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5684.12s)]
*  that sought to determine whether the letters still exist [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5687.14s)]
*  and are in her possession. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5689.56s)]
*  Pressed for details about the incidents, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5692.320000000001s)]
*  her spokesperson told the Star [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5693.8s)]
*  they consisted of racist slurs and hate mail [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5695.04s)]
*  that were put in her and 17 other student campus mailboxes. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5696.92s)]
*  But the paper reports that Crockett's office [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5700.52s)]
*  did not reply to the Star's inquiry [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5702.240000000001s)]
*  seeking to determine whether Crockett [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5703.84s)]
*  and the other students ever filed a police report. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5705.240000000001s)]
*  Okay, I mean, I'm sorry, [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5710.0s)]
*  but this woman, I think Todd Starnes had it right. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5712.72s)]
*  She's cosplaying something other than what she is. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5715.4800000000005s)]
*  They're all cosplaying. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5720.700000000001s)]
*  I was at a Senate hearing recently [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5722.52s)]
*  and I looked at the left side of the horseshoe. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5724.4400000000005s)]
*  It was the RFK Jr. confirmation hearing. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5726.88s)]
*  And there was Bernie playing the socialist [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5730.0s)]
*  and there was Elizabeth Warren playing [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5732.4800000000005s)]
*  the puritanical scold. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5734.56s)]
*  And it was like a boy band or a band [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5736.28s)]
*  that had been assembled by a casting agent. [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5740.0s)]
*  They have a person who represents each part [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5742.68s)]
*  of their demographic or their constituency [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5745.88s)]
*  and they play the role to the hilt. [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5749.04s)]
*  But the biggest difference these days [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5752.92s)]
*  between Democrats and Republicans is this. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5754.56s)]
*  On the Republican side, people claim [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5757.48s)]
*  that they should have power because of what they've done. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5760.48s)]
*  I'm Elon Musk, I shoot rockets into space, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5763.5599999999995s)]
*  I administer Twitter, I'm Donald Trump, [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5766.48s)]
*  I built skyscrapers and developed real estate [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5769.28s)]
*  around the world. [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5772.839999999999s)]
*  On the Democratic side, it's what was done to you [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5773.919999999999s)]
*  that's important. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5777.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5778.879999999999s)]
*  This is what happened to me when I was young, [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5779.719999999999s)]
*  when I was in college. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5782.679999999999s)]
*  I was a victim. [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5784.16s)]
*  Now, I just think in America, claiming that victimization [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5785.48s)]
*  is an accomplishment is a period that's over. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5788.959999999999s)]
*  She's still at it, but I don't think it flies. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5793.7s)]
*  She's another AOC who was Sandy Cortez [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5798.08s)]
*  for her entire upbringing in Yorktown Heights, [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5801.639999999999s)]
*  which is part of Westchester, Matt. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5804.32s)]
*  Not Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5806.32s)]
*  woman with a Puerto Rican history. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5809.719999999999s)]
*  She does have a Puerto Rican parent [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5812.54s)]
*  and the other's the white person from Westchester, I think. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5813.98s)]
*  In any event, now she's AOC, [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5816.62s)]
*  and she wants us to lean into the person of color she is [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5819.299999999999s)]
*  and the rough upbringing she had in the Bronx, [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5822.0199999999995s)]
*  which is not Yorktown Heights, trust me. [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5824.54s)]
*  Lifelong resident of New York State [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5828.459999999999s)]
*  and dated a guy for five years [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5830.2s)]
*  from Yorktown Heights to stop. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5831.9s)]
*  In any event, now Jasmine Crockett's out there. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5833.5s)]
*  She wants to be the lead attacker of Elon Musk, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5837.379999999999s)]
*  of Governor Abbott, of Ted Cruz. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5842.74s)]
*  Here's her latest on Elon, [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5845.38s)]
*  I guess as she celebrates her birthday, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5847.46s)]
*  which was March 19th. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5850.3s)]
*  On March 29th, it's my birthday. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5854.42s)]
*  And all I want to see happen on my birthday [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5856.78s)]
*  is for Elon to be taken down, yes. [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5859.7s)]
*  Listen, I have learned as I serve [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5863.22s)]
*  on the Doge Oversight Committee [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5865.9400000000005s)]
*  that there is only one language [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5868.6s)]
*  that the people that are in charge understand right now. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5871.6s)]
*  And that language is money. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5874.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, she sounded normal there a little bit, Matt. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5878.76s)]
*  I guess the accent comes and goes. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5881.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it seems like this is a person [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5884.320000000001s)]
*  for whom there is more than one language. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5886.76s)]
*  Um. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5889.34s)]
*  Um. [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5890.18s)]
*  Um. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5891.02s)]
*  And it's apparently not just money, but, um, yeah. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5892.02s)]
*  I think Walter's exactly right. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5895.4400000000005s)]
*  And your comparison to AOC is apt. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5897.96s)]
*  It's so strange. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5901.12s)]
*  You know, Ocasio-Cortez, before she became, [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5902.84s)]
*  before she ran for Congress for the first time, [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5906.28s)]
*  there was a burning back group called Brand New Congress, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5908.44s)]
*  whose mission was to replace the entire Congress. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5911.52s)]
*  Alexis, stop. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5916.42s)]
*  To replace the entire Congress [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5919.08s)]
*  with populist candidates. [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5922.76s)]
*  And they chose to support AOC [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5925.32s)]
*  because when the people from this group [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5927.9s)]
*  met with her, they felt like she was a, quote, normal person [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5931.64s)]
*  and wouldn't come off as an activist [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5935.52s)]
*  who would rug voters the wrong way. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5937.72s)]
*  And so the irony of that is, you know, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5940.92s)]
*  she gets into Congress and immediately adopts [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5943.4800000000005s)]
*  a completely different personality. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5945.9800000000005s)]
*  I think that does happen at times. [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5947.64s)]
*  You know, people, once they get a taste of politics [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5950.56s)]
*  and they, especially when they get a taste [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5953.28s)]
*  of social media attention, [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5955.92s)]
*  you just never know what's gonna happen to them. [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5957.0s)]
*  And the incentives, [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5959.64s)]
*  particularly in the Democratic Party politics, [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5961.4800000000005s)]
*  are all wrong now. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5963.120000000001s)]
*  They just incentivize people to behave in ways [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5963.96s)]
*  that they never would in real life. [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5966.76s)]
*  You know, while I used to have a best friend [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5968.6s)]
*  who she would have a few drinks back in the college days [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5970.08s)]
*  and she would start speaking with a Southern accent, [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5972.88s)]
*  it was organic. [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5975.84s)]
*  It wasn't an affectation, just kind of started coming out. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5976.96s)]
*  It was her drunk personality. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5979.9400000000005s)]
*  I don't think Jasmine Crockett has such an excuse. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5981.92s)]
*  She's trying to send some sort of a message. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5985.0s)]
*  She thinks like being street is gonna make her seem tough [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5987.28s)]
*  or get her some sort of cred with some sort of a group, [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5991.44s)]
*  but really just makes her look dumb, [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5994.84s)]
*  especially when you have the old tape of her. [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=5996.5599999999995s)]
*  It's middle-class and upper-middle-class people [[01:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6000.5599999999995s)]
*  pretending to be poor. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6002.88s)]
*  And nobody wants their children to grow up and be poor. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6004.5199999999995s)]
*  She's playing a role and when she's relaxed, [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6009.08s)]
*  she stops playing it, as we just saw. [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6012.96s)]
*  In fact, when she's drunk, she sounds like a kid [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6015.24s)]
*  who went to a private school. [[01:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6017.36s)]
*  Mm-hmm, yeah, that's right. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aJTVP78rSQs&t=6019.0s)]
