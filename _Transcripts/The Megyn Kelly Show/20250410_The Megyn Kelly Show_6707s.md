Video Description: Megyn Kelly opens the show with the incredible news of American ballerina Ksenia Karelina’s release from a brutal Russian labor camp after 15 months of captivity just days after her boyfriend boxer Chris van Heerden appeared on The Megyn Kelly Show. Then Stu Buguiere, host of BlazeTV's Stu Does America, joins to discuss the reason behind President Trump’s decision to pause tariffs, the meltdowns and freakouts before and after, the role of President Trump and his team in securing her freedom, the difference between justice and revenge, why it's important for President Trump to hold those who politicized government accountable, the way the corporate media has completely mischaracterized the story, NBC News forced to settle the defamation suit filed against them by a doctor who MSNBC hosts claimed was the "uterus collector," the false reporting from Rachel Maddow and Chris Hayes, John Oliver’s dismissive defense of boys in girl’s sports, him offensively downplaying traumatic injuries, his condescending denial of biological reality, and more. Then Jason and Erica Redman, authors of "Mission: Invincible Marriage," join to discuss their powerful story of resilience after Jason was severely wounded as a Navy SEAL, how their strong foundation kept their marriage intact, the importance of vulnerability in their marriage, and more.

# American Freed by Trump, Oliver's Outrageous Segment, and Marriage Tips, w/ Burguiere & The Redmans
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 10, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Oh, this morning, our staff, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=0.0s)]
*  along with the world woke up to incredible news involving a story we brought to you on Monday. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5.44s)]
*  That ballerina we told you about, Ksenia Karolina, she's on her way home. It's unbelievable. It's a [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=12.08s)]
*  miracle. I can't believe it. I'm so thrilled. I'm so grateful to President Trump and Secretary of [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=20.48s)]
*  State Marco Rubio. She has dual citizenship, Russian and American. She's an amateur ballerina [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=26.4s)]
*  over here. And for the last 15 months, she has been wrongfully detained in Russia on these [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=32.96s)]
*  trumped up bogus charges. And now she's free. This morning, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=38.8s)]
*  posting to X, quote, American Ksenia Karolina is on a plane back home to the United States. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=45.599999999999994s)]
*  She was wrongfully detained by Russia for over a year and President Trump secured her release. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=51.44s)]
*  The president of the United States will continue to work for the release of all Americans. Last [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=55.76s)]
*  August, Ksenia was convicted again. These are ridiculous charges in Russia as she visited [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=61.76s)]
*  family there of state treason and handed a 12 year prison sentence in a Russian labor camp. Her crime, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=68.0s)]
*  she donated $51 two years prior while in the United States as a U S citizen to a U S based [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=78.88s)]
*  nonprofit that helps children and elderly impacted by the war in Ukraine. $50, you guys, [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=87.12s)]
*  the details of what happened to her are downright frightening. So she traveled to Russia for the [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=94.88s)]
*  first time in three years to visit her elderly grandmother. Her family still lives over there. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=101.67999999999999s)]
*  First, she was detained for 16 hours at the airport for interrogation. She never even made [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=106.32s)]
*  it past the airport under suspicion. She might be some sort of a spy. Then she was released, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=111.27999999999999s)]
*  but they kept her phone and boy, oh boy, did they go through it. That's how they found this payment [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=116.88s)]
*  on her Venmo. And they found the receipt of this donation on Monday. And by the way, and then they [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=121.19999999999999s)]
*  charged her first, they accused her of hooliganism, hooliganism. That's what they charge. And then they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=127.91999999999999s)]
*  up the ante to treason, which you can go to jail for a long, long time for. Originally, it was like [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=134.48s)]
*  15 years. And then they were talking about a life sentence. And they, they strong armed her into [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=140.0s)]
*  copying a plea because she didn't want to go to jail forever. They were like, well, you can go [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=145.67999999999998s)]
*  to jail for maybe five years if you say you did this. And she didn't think she had any, any options. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=149.6s)]
*  So she did. And they gave her a 12 year sentence on Monday. I mean, literally four days ago, we had [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=156.0s)]
*  a long interview with Cassiniya's boyfriend, Chris Van Yerden. Chris is a former international [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=163.51999999999998s)]
*  boxing organization, welterweight world champion who retired from the sport last year to work full [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=169.44s)]
*  time on getting Cassiniya home. See, he had paid for her to take the trip as a Christmas gift so [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=175.92s)]
*  she could see her family. And he spoke to us on Monday about the charges she faced. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=183.51999999999998s)]
*  $51. After they took her phone, they send her back to her family. So they released her to her family [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=188.72s)]
*  and they said, you're not allowed to leave your country and work. You will hear from us. And, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  we now know within the three weeks from January 2nd till January 27th, they investigated every [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=201.28s)]
*  single thing on her cell phone. This is where they came across the Venmo, $51 on Venmo, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  charges for treason, funding the enemy state. That's what she was charging for funding the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=214.32s)]
*  enemy state buying weapons. And if you know, I started laughing and crying at the same time [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=219.68s)]
*  because it was like, if you know my Cassiniya, she is the sweetest, kindest person you'll meet. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=227.84s)]
*  She goes out of her way to do good for people. She hates seeing people hurt. So you can imagine [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=234.88s)]
*  elderly people, young kids without food and water. She would be the first to donate money. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=242.64s)]
*  Chris also described the very harsh prison conditions she was facing in Siberia. He told [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=250.07999999999998s)]
*  us that while Cassiniya is mentally strong, she was signaling in letters that she did not expect [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=257.2s)]
*  to survive the full sentence over there. She's in a labor camp, right? So she's there. She wakes up [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  at 6 a.m. in the morning. She works till 9 p.m. at night. She gets two 15 minutes breaks in between [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=268.56s)]
*  for first of all for lunch or coffee break or to brush her teeth or whatever. It's snowing in [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=275.76s)]
*  Siberia. Those two ways she's out there close to Siberia. It's snowing, it's freezing cold out there [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=284.56s)]
*  working. There was a moment of her not going to the showers for two weeks. But again Cassiniya [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=290.16s)]
*  knowing her, she would write to me, she gave vape. Her mother would send her some wipes and stuff [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=294.56s)]
*  and she was like I would use the toilet water to clean myself. She's got problems with her legs and [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=301.68s)]
*  this worries me. This really worries me. She's now all of a sudden got leg pain. She's got some [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=314.32s)]
*  big veins popping out on her legs from all the standing. She's explaining to me in the letters [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=319.84s)]
*  how she's peeling thousands and thousands of potatoes every day. But you only get a few [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=324.56s)]
*  seconds. There's people yelling and sweating at you all day and you got to rush and then you've [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=330.08s)]
*  got to put the potatoes in the boiling water. So she's got blisters on her hand from the boiling [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=334.15999999999997s)]
*  water burning her hands and she's getting basically no attention. Like it's harsh. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=338.55999999999995s)]
*  Do you think she could do 12 years in these conditions? No, she cannot. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=346.8s)]
*  On our show Chris also sent this message directly to President Trump. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=355.52s)]
*  I'm on your show Megan because I know President Trump has a lot of respect for you. I've watched [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=360.0s)]
*  his interviews, he watches your shows. He takes note to what you say and I'm on here and I'm begging. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=365.84s)]
*  I'm not a begging man but I'm begging for this girl's life. It is not looking good for her [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=371.84s)]
*  and if there's somebody that can bring Ksenia back it's President Trump. I know it. She's already [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=378.32s)]
*  given up. She's already 90% given up but we will not give up on her. I will not give up on her. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  You know I feel like I'm reliving my dad's experience. President Trump got Mark Vogel home [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=391.03999999999996s)]
*  and I believe he could get Ksenia home too. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=395.36s)]
*  Well, message received and today for the second time since the start of his second term [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=400.72s)]
*  President Trump has returned an American from Russian captivity. This is incredible. You heard [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=407.04s)]
*  me mention it there in February he brought home American school teacher Mark Vogel. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=412.40000000000003s)]
*  This like I can't believe it. We were all just talking about her. We felt totally hopeless [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=416.56s)]
*  a matter of hours ago and look at this exclusive photo that we have received. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=422.71999999999997s)]
*  This is Ksenia today. Look at this holding the American flag on the flight back to the United [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=426.96s)]
*  States. Oh my gosh. This is wonderful. She has the green sweatshirt on her father describing to the [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=433.76s)]
*  Daily Mail what happened when Ksenia called him saying quote the first seconds of our chat [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=440.55999999999995s)]
*  were all pure emotion. I cannot imagine what we were saying. It was like one explosion of happiness [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=445.2s)]
*  and a short time ago we received this statement from Chris. He says I'm overjoyed to hear that [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=452.48s)]
*  the love of my life Ksenia is on her way home from wrongful detention in Russia. She's endured [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=456.96s)]
*  a nightmare for 15 months and I cannot wait to hold her. He thanked everybody who has helped to [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=462.48s)]
*  bring attention to this story. He mentioned them on the show the other day as well in particular [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=468.56s)]
*  Peter Berg. You remember the guy behind the Friday Night Lights series and oh god he's done [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  so much in Hollywood but he try and remember he's got some connection to Peter Berg but oh [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=479.28s)]
*  I think it might be through his boxing. In any event he also thanked Dana White who's been [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=485.03999999999996s)]
*  advocating for Ksenia. A lot of people have taken up this cause. It's amazing. It worked. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=490.88s)]
*  He just can I just tell you something else? Well I'll bring this up when I bring Stu on but listen [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=497.52s)]
*  Ksenia is going to go to a military hospital when she's back on US soil and listen we send her our [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=501.67999999999995s)]

*  invited to the wedding. It's unbelievable and congratulations to team Trump. Hats off to you. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=514.4s)]
*  Wow. Joining me now is Stu Bergier, host of Blaze TV's Stu Does America. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=522.0s)]
*  has been routinely especially recently hitting all-time highs. In volatile markets like the one [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=538.08s)]
*  we're seeing do not sit on the sidelines with your head in the sand. You can take control and [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=543.44s)]
*  safeguard your savings. This is why so many Americans today are turning to Birch Gold Group. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=547.84s)]
*  They have helped tens of thousands convert an existing IRA or 401k into an IRA in physical gold. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=553.0400000000001s)]
*  Is it time for you to hedge against economic instability with gold? To learn how to own [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=560.0s)]
*  physical gold in a tax sheltered account text MK to the number 989898. Birch Gold will send you a [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=564.96s)]
*  free no obligation info kit. Again text MK to the number 989898. With an A plus rating from the [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=570.8s)]
*  Better Business Bureau and countless of five-star reviews Birch Gold has helped many protect their [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=576.96s)]
*  savings with gold. It took us decades to get into the tangled mess they're now trying to unpack in [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=582.08s)]
*  DC. How long will it take to get out of that mess and at what cost? Consider gold as an option. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=588.24s)]
*  Text MK to 989898 today. Stu, Chris told us hi first of all. Chris told us that he had to work [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=595.92s)]
*  hard during the Biden years because this all happened during Biden to get them to finally [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=608.72s)]
*  just designate her as wrongfully detained which was like climbing a mountain and finally they did [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=613.6s)]
*  it and then he told us that he just felt that they kept yesing him to death and that they didn't do [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=619.44s)]
*  anything. He realized too late into her confinement that the Biden administration was not going to do [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=624.96s)]
*  anything to help her never mind Biden himself. Trump has been in office for two months he's [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=632.16s)]
*  already gotten forget outside of Russia. I mean you know we saw Rick Grinnell with those prisoners [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=638.08s)]
*  from Venezuela. We've got two American citizens back on American soil, Ksenia almost, from Russia [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=643.36s)]
*  and this guy for Ksenia apparently we traded some guy some German guy was 33 years old who was [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=651.52s)]
*  selling some sort of information about computers to the Russians that he shouldn't have had. So [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=657.92s)]
*  okay it's not exactly great but it's not like you know one of the most evil people that we'd have to [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=664.08s)]
*  give up. I mean no man left behind no woman left behind. She's one of ours she has dual citizenship. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=669.84s)]
*  This is an American who is dying in a Siberian labor camp who was completely forgotten by Joe [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=677.52s)]
*  Biden. What do you make of it? Well first of all I mean you did this interview on Monday. I'm a [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  little disappointed it took you three full days Megan to get her home. You know you got to step [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=691.0400000000001s)]
*  up your game a little bit here. It's an incredible story and a miracle right? This is a miracle and [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=696.48s)]
*  you're of course right that a lot of people worked on this including President Trump. One of the [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=703.44s)]
*  things you can say I think quite clearly about President Trump in these situations and he's [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=708.08s)]
*  shown it over and over again is he actually cares. This is a totally different approach I think than [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=711.52s)]
*  as you mentioned Biden. He really cares about this stuff and because he gets tons and tons [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=719.12s)]
*  of criticism for you know his relationship to Russia. I think if we turn on MSNBC they'd be [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=725.84s)]
*  telling us about Russia Gate right now. But there's benefits to having a relationship that at least [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=731.52s)]
*  you can talk to a country like this that is doing things like this. You know I have no fan of what [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=738.88s)]
*  Russia did and is doing in Ukraine. I'm no fan certainly of them taking our people hostage [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=744.5600000000001s)]
*  but like you have to have the ability. It's like a you know it's sort of like just being an adult [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=750.7199999999999s)]
*  on the world stage. You have to have the ability to go and talk to these nations and be able to [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=756.4s)]
*  have conversations about important things like that. You're never going to agree with everything [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=761.04s)]
*  with Vladimir Putin. We all understand that they're doing you know they're doing things in that country [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=765.36s)]
*  that we don't want done and we think are horrible. But we have to be able to talk to them and at least [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=769.68s)]
*  get you know we didn't trade an international terrorist this time which is a really good [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=775.52s)]
*  really good outcome. The fact that we can get someone who's totally innocent back here on our [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=780.4s)]
*  soil is a massive massive win. It's so big and it's like not just any country you know it's like now [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=785.36s)]
*  President Trump says we're going to be meeting one-on-one with Iran. When Obama first suggested [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=791.36s)]
*  doing that it sounded crazy because it was clearly a slip. It was something he just kind of popped off [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=796.16s)]
*  with at a debate and then he got so much blowback he made it U.S. policy. But and now Trump's and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=800.88s)]
*  now he's like we're all doing that. But the thing about Russia is Russia's huge. Russia's actually a [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=806.0s)]
*  really important player on the world stage for a couple of reasons. I mean yes they call it like [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=811.36s)]
*  basically just a gas station but it's a massive player when it comes to gas, oil, energy. Not to [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=816.08s)]
*  mention it's fully armed with nuclear warheads. So it's like there is a lot of upside to having [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=823.36s)]
*  somewhat of a good relationship with Russia and Trump should not be embarrassed for trying to [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=830.56s)]
*  cultivate that. That's probably why she's on her way home right now. So God bless this couple. God [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=835.1199999999999s)]
*  bless Trump. Marco Rubio too. All the guys and gals who worked on this. Well done. They brought [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=840.64s)]
*  one of ours home and I am I'm thrilled about it. Okay let's talk about Trump in general because [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=845.92s)]
*  it's like two alternate universes reading what he did with the terrorists. The New York Times is [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=853.5999999999999s)]
*  completely calling bullshit on him saying this was the strategy all along. He didn't say that [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=860.24s)]
*  really exactly but Scott Besson said it. Caroline Levitt said it. It's art of the deal. He was sort [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=865.6s)]
*  of playing setting everybody up for this big announcement that really would target and out [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=872.48s)]
*  China as an unfair actor in the end. And then you have the president's defenders saying no that's [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=877.84s)]
*  exactly right. That's what he was doing. He was playing chess when everybody else was playing [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=885.6s)]
*  checkers. And then you have Trump himself who kind of says exactly why he did it in SOT 7 outside of [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=889.68s)]
*  the White House on Wednesday. The thing about why you decided to put a 90 day pause. Well I thought [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=896.9599999999999s)]
*  that people were jumping a little bit out of line. They were getting yippy you know they were getting [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=903.1999999999999s)]
*  a little bit yippy a little bit afraid. So I mean that's Trump's own explanation which suggests [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=909.76s)]
*  if it was part of the plan maybe it got accelerated given you know the jitters on the market and in [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=917.84s)]
*  particular I don't purport to understand the bond market but in particular what was happening with [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=923.9200000000001s)]
*  the bond market yesterday which which I guess could have potentially was so volatile could have [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=928.5600000000001s)]
*  led to a longer and more intractable recession or near recession. Your thoughts on it? [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=933.2800000000001s)]
*  Yeah it's interesting. I mean I don't think it was his plan for it to play out this way. You know I [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=939.6s)]
*  think I would hate to be honestly an aide of President Trump because he just has this way. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=946.72s)]
*  You go into Washington to be an aide. Your job is to kind of say whatever you can to make things [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=951.92s)]
*  seem as positive as possible and then a lot of times Donald Trump is like yeah I'm just going to [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=957.76s)]
*  tell the truth. So he just comes out and kind of undercuts you. That wasn't it at all. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=961.36s)]
*  Yeah not at all actually. I just thought people were getting yippy and I think that's true right. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=967.2s)]
*  I think one of the strengths of President Trump in situations like this is he's not particularly [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=971.68s)]
*  all that ideological at these moments and while I think he has a real true belief in in tariff [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=976.56s)]
*  policy it's something I think is one of them he's been the most consistent on since you know gosh [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=983.68s)]
*  back in the 1980s I remember this guy talking about it. He also recognizes that there there are [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=987.76s)]
*  downsides. He warned about pain going into that and seeing the reaction of this he may have thought [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=993.5999999999999s)]
*  too that the rates would come down there'd be an additional benefit. When they didn't go that way [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1001.2s)]
*  it did I think shake him a little bit and he was willing to come out and say look you know I think [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1005.76s)]
*  the most important part of this is the China part of it. I'm going to stick by that. Let's give a 90 [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1010.48s)]
*  day. Everyone can take a breather here a little bit here and see where this goes. You know as a [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  guy who believes in free trade I'm not a fan of tariff policy generally speaking. China of course [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1020.48s)]
*  as an adversary there's a little bit of a difference there but I think this was the [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1026.8s)]
*  right move for President Trump to remove this. I think it was too widespread and you know there [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1031.52s)]
*  are a lot of good arguments to change our policy towards China. They do cheat. They are an adversary [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1037.6s)]
*  and they're not out for our best interest. I think such a broad strategy here where everyone [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1043.6s)]
*  including allies and people who like Israel who went to zero percent still tariffing countries [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1049.68s)]
*  like that I don't think is particularly the right policy but then again no one voted for me. They [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1055.92s)]
*  voted for him. Well and I mean we have improved our respective positions on trade with numerous [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1060.96s)]
*  countries. There's no question but we've also rattled the markets worldwide and sent a message [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1068.3200000000002s)]
*  that we might not be the most reliable trading partner. You know we can do things like this so [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1073.8400000000001s)]
*  you know was it worth it I guess is the question that we'll be looking at in the coming days. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1079.28s)]
*  Here was Scott Besson explaining that this was a long plan. This is all part of the plan yesterday [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1083.28s)]
*  at the White House. Again this was driven by the President's strategy. He and I had a long talk on [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1089.36s)]
*  Sunday and this was his strategy all along and that you know you might even say that he go to China [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1095.6s)]
*  into a bad position. They responded. They have shown themselves to the world to be the bad actors [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1103.92s)]
*  and we are willing to cooperate with our allies and with our trading partners who did not retaliate. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1111.76s)]
*  It wasn't a hard message. Don't retaliate. Things will turn out well. So look I think [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1119.92s)]
*  they may be benefiting from the fact that most people don't fully know what to believe right. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1127.12s)]
*  Like I think most of Trump's fans are willing to give him a chance and now his more elite sort of [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1132.56s)]
*  base who have millions in the stock market are very relieved and by the way every single one of [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1138.72s)]
*  them is declaring that it's thanks to them. It's amazing. They're all like he listened to me. He [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1143.3600000000001s)]
*  listened to me. He listened to me. It's like okay I what the Daily Mail reported is that he listened [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1148.32s)]
*  to Jay to Jamie Dimon of JP Morgan Chase who's in his ear like and who's a very smart sober guy [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1153.3600000000001s)]
*  who said look this is what's going to happen now. Now it's gotten really bad and I'm sure he's [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1160.08s)]
*  listened to you know his top advisors like Besant too but I don't I just don't think as [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1163.76s)]
*  many of his detractors are predicting that this is going to crater his approval rating because [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1169.52s)]
*  people were so rattled by the past five days. Yeah I think that's definitely overstated. I heard you [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1173.04s)]
*  talking about not panicking and of course that's incredibly good advice. There's no it doesn't do [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1181.52s)]
*  any good for you if you do panic and of course it doesn't change the policy either so it doesn't [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1186.08s)]
*  really matter. When you talk about the markets overall that's it's a it's a sign and I think [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1191.44s)]
*  we could I am concerned that if this policy is this broad and this strong if that's where we [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1198.0800000000002s)]
*  wind up landing in 90 days it could do enough damage to the economy the people's general [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1203.3600000000001s)]
*  speaking economy not worrying about necessarily you know millionaires in the market but regular [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1208.72s)]
*  people who are paying much more for goods and having to deal with the outcomes of that process [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1212.72s)]
*  and it's not just you know people like that like it's also small business people. I have a friend [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1218.32s)]
*  who works in he imports parts for oil and gas again a central part of of Donald Trump's mission [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1221.76s)]
*  here right to get us in energy independent and to you know to take the best of our resources [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1230.08s)]
*  and and make the United States more powerful like this is an important part of of Trump's mission. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1235.52s)]
*  This guy's a Trump voter but what he has he has been chasing a contract overseas for a very long [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1240.32s)]
*  time which he finally locked down after a couple of years that contract had a designated production [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1247.6s)]
*  schedule in a foreign country and a designated price that he was going to sell to the oil company. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1254.24s)]
*  Well now he's paying if these tariffs were to go through at their old pace much more than he [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1260.0s)]
*  was paying that he was earning from the product so now he's underwater and he has to figure out [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1266.6399999999999s)]
*  whether do I accept essentially a loss on every product that I sell to this new company to lock [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1271.6s)]
*  them in for a long-term deal and hope the policy changes at some point or do I go back to the [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1277.76s)]
*  company and say hey I have to bail on this deal and then it's opened up to bidding all over again [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1284.08s)]
*  right. These are hitting his own supporters and they don't they they don't control this policy [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1289.28s)]
*  they believe in his mission they believe China and all these other countries have kind of screwed [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1294.8s)]
*  us in some of these situations but like they're at a point where they just are out of their own [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1299.44s)]
*  control and I think there is a certain percentage of the American people who are going to stick by [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1305.44s)]
*  Trump no matter what he does and then there's some people who I think will look at this and say [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1311.2s)]
*  one of the reasons why I voted for Donald Trump was to avoid the feeling I had during Joe Biden [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1315.44s)]
*  where things were changing all the time we didn't know what was going to happen prices were going up. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1321.3600000000001s)]
*  They were mistaken that was a mistake you should not vote Trump in office because you want complete [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1325.68s)]
*  steadiness and no surprises that's that was that was never promised. No that's true. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1331.6000000000001s)]

*  every union leader that I've ever seen in my life has come out and advocated for tariffs and you know [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1481.68s)]
*  there's always Democratic senators who are always there advocating for them and now all the sudden [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1487.84s)]

*  abandon it just as soon as Trump endorses it yeah my favorite example of this Megan is from [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1515.36s)]
*  the last few weeks where in Donald Trump was they were tossing around this idea of pulling [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1520.6399999999999s)]
*  soda and candy and cookies off of food stamps so you couldn't no longer use food stamps to purchase [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1526.3999999999999s)]

*  be able to do that and then the American Medical Association came out and said no you should be [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1535.28s)]
*  able to buy soda and cookies with food stamps the American Medical Association [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1541.12s)]
*  that's because their own Dr. Mark Hyman was on the show the other day explaining that yeah there I [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1547.4399999999998s)]

*  Trump was like I don't know I'm kind of for it makes sense to me and that's another one where [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1570.96s)]
*  you might see all the Democrats who previously liked it just completely flip never mind we have [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1575.44s)]
*  to be in there if he likes it there's something we're missing about it all right so that's the [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1579.28s)]
*  tariffs we'll see how it all shakes out I mean like honestly I'm kind of over it I'm kind of [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1583.52s)]
*  this is Mark Halpern's take and he's as honest a broker as we're gonna find he writes 50 bond [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1588.4s)]

*  get through uh with just Republicans and 25% rich people calling Trump and he said it also known as [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1600.8s)]

*  the bond market 50% which yeah a lot of people were looking at that okay I want to talk about [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1620.24s)]
*  some other stuff he's doing so he has been like cracking down a bit on those who attacked him [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1624.56s)]
*  um a couple of law firms one law firm that hired one of his chief antagonists at Alvin Bragg's [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1633.52s)]
*  office that guy there was this guy who was jumping up and down saying we've got to prosecute Trump [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1639.84s)]
*  like criminally prosecute Trump for whatever's going on at his Trump company and even Al Alvin [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1643.84s)]
*  Bragg was like no I don't we don't have that we got we're gonna go after him but I don't think [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1650.56s)]
*  we can get his company and that guy quit he wrote a book about it he quit in protest and he got hired [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1654.96s)]
*  by Paul Weiss so Trump issued an executive order cracking down on Paul Weiss like you know what [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1659.2s)]
*  the government's not gonna do business with you and we're just really not interested in a law [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1665.6s)]
*  firm like this being connected to the US government and Paul Weiss got a bunch of calls from clients [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1669.52s)]

*  Paul Weiss bent the knee immediately and went to President Trump and worked out a deal they're [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1684.64s)]
*  gonna make donations to organizations they're gonna do pro bono work that he approves of they [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1689.44s)]

*  we have Trump executive orders targeting two individuals by name and I'll just read to you [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1708.48s)]
*  here from Politico the directives that he signed on Wednesday order the justice department to [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1716.24s)]
*  scrutinize Chris Krebs who ran Trump's cyber security and infrastructure security agency [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1720.1599999999999s)]
*  and former Homeland Security official Miles Taylor who is Miles Taylor the name may be familiar [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1726.32s)]
*  to the audience out there uh though he originally didn't want it to be he is [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1731.12s)]
*  anonymous who's published in the New York Times as some sort of senior Trump official [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1736.8799999999999s)]
*  who's keeping Trump honest behind the scenes and so what Trump has said is um you guys are going [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1744.7199999999998s)]
*  to have your security clearances polled and we're going to investigate at least in the case of [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1752.6399999999999s)]
*  Miles whether you used classified information for your book or in any other way okay so the [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1759.28s)]
*  left wing is melting down over this he doesn't like Krebs I think because Krebs um he was fired [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1767.84s)]
*  by Trump via tweet had been out there asserting that when Joe won in 2020 that quote in every [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1775.76s)]
*  case of which we are aware those claims of fraud either have been unsubstantiated or are technically [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1781.36s)]
*  incoherent and then he authorized a joint statement by many groups that said the election [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1786.96s)]
*  was secure no indication of any votes being changed or stolen which Trump wasn't happy with [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1792.8s)]
*  and then he was a key witness for the j6 select committee so clearly this guy got on Trump's bad [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1797.68s)]
*  side and now I mean he's having his his security clearance pulled they're saying in this executive [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1803.1200000000001s)]
*  order that um he's a significant bad faith actor who weaponized and abused his government authority [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1809.52s)]
*  uh Trump as he signed the order stripping Krebs security clearance and opening an investigation [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1817.76s)]
*  into his activities repeated his claims that the election was quote rigged uh and then same thing [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1822.56s)]
*  so this guy Miles is going to be investigated Taylor to see whether he used classified information [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1830.48s)]
*  writing his book and also see his security clearances why wouldn't these guys have already [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1835.76s)]
*  lost their security clearances they haven't been working for the government in years miles quit in [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1840.0800000000002s)]
*  2019 the other guy quit right before uh right you know around the 2020 election like why why do we [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1844.72s)]
*  let these security clearances stay in place after these people leave government services so that's [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1851.92s)]
*  one thing but the real question I want to get to is do is how do we feel about this because you could [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1856.0s)]
*  argue that you know national review argued in the case of the law firms this is effectively a bill [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1863.2s)]
*  of attainder where the congress or the president specifies like picks out an individual company or [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1868.0800000000002s)]
*  individual and declares them guilty of a crime and imposes a punishment without due process [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1875.52s)]
*  or is this perfectly fair game let's start there [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1882.4s)]
*  you know it's interesting I I you're the legal expert in this conversation so at some level I'm [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1885.28s)]
*  I would definitely cede that to you I think when it comes to a a moral judgment there are there's [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1891.6000000000001s)]
*  two sides of this right there's two paths this can go down there's there's justice and there's revenge [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1898.0800000000002s)]
*  and I think from from a moral standpoint it's pretty clear that revenge is not okay and justice [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1903.68s)]
*  is and you have to kind of wonder which which way this is going and I think that's a good [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1908.96s)]
*  way to think about which way this is going I think there are Trump has a pretty clear record [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1914.4s)]
*  of really being upset about people who come after him and and and we'll go after him and as he said [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1920.24s)]
*  many many times punch back twice as hard you know what makes me a little nervous about this [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1925.3600000000001s)]
*  is I want to make sure that there are checks and balances to make sure that any president not Trump [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1931.76s)]
*  or anyone else does this I didn't like it when I think the the Biden White House was going after [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1937.76s)]
*  Donald Trump and going after their political enemies and I don't think it's okay for Trump [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1942.72s)]
*  to do the same thing I don't know that he's doing that here I mean we don't have the results of [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1947.5200000000002s)]
*  whatever investigation might be coming from this I think he is sending a very clear message to [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1951.68s)]
*  anyone who does stand up against him not to do this next time because we're not going to forget [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1957.92s)]
*  he's not the guy that lets this stuff roll off of his back at least he's not anymore I mean if you [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1962.5600000000002s)]
*  remember he kind of promised the same thing against Hillary Clinton when he was running [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1966.96s)]
*  initially in 2015 and 2016 and then when he got into office he kind of shrugged his shoulders [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1970.8799999999999s)]
*  and said look that's all politics I do think some of this has changed some of it changes when [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1975.52s)]
*  someone threatens to take your entire rest of your life away by throwing you in prison for a very [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1981.52s)]
*  long time some of it changes when someone tries to take your life away with a bullet hitting your [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1986.0s)]
*  ear while you're standing on stage I can understand why he wants to make sure people who were trying [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1990.72s)]
*  to destroy his life and his livelihood are held responsible we should though I think as conservative [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=1996.8s)]
*  I applaud the efforts of national review to at least say let's hold a standard here to make sure [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2003.04s)]
*  that we're the ones holding it up we can we're never going to get what we want out of the left [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2009.04s)]
*  but it's important that we watch this closely people you know like you Megan who can kind of [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2014.08s)]

*  at five in the morning whereupon the FBI came through his door with some multiple agents guns [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2232.24s)]
*  out announcing to James O'Keefe that they were investigating him for the possible crime of [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2241.6s)]
*  allegedly trying to buy Ashley Biden's diary he came and very weirdly the New York Times had the [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2248.72s)]
*  story within hours very strangely this you know covert operation in the dawn of the morning [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2259.76s)]
*  somehow the New York Times just kind of knew to be near James O'Keefe's apartment because news might [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2267.36s)]
*  possibly f these guys so James O'Keefe came on my show shortly thereafter very rattled by what was [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2273.2000000000003s)]
*  being done to him of course and not just him but his staff too had the same treatment another guy [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2280.0800000000004s)]
*  and his staff same exact thing and here's what he said we reached out our lawyer sent a letter to [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2284.4s)]
*  Ashley Biden's attorney and then and that's when Ashley Biden's attorney said we're taking this to [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2290.64s)]
*  the southern district of New York that's for those of you who don't know what that is that's the [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2296.56s)]
*  federal jurisdiction the the Department of Justice in New York where we're located in West Chester [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2300.48s)]
*  County New York and and they referred to this somehow this got to the FBI the Department of [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2305.52s)]
*  Justice and this is where things take an insane turn a year later a year later suddenly my two [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2311.2s)]
*  journalistic colleagues get raided by the FBI with a battering ram they go into my colleagues [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2319.12s)]
*  houses at 6 a.m take all types of computers and laptops these are journalists news gathering [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2325.4399999999996s)]
*  materials confidential sources this has never happened before in history for the for the [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2331.6s)]
*  executed search warrant like this and then now we find out some this was last month that they [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2338.08s)]
*  issued secret warrants to Microsoft Corporation [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2343.12s)]
*  okay so they've been harassing James O'Keefe for almost four years suggesting he it is not illegal [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2350.3199999999997s)]
*  to publish an ill-gotten diary ill-gotten emails any sort of ill-gotten anything it's not it is [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2360.9599999999996s)]
*  illegal to pay someone to steal them but there was no evidence that James O'Keefe had done that [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2368.56s)]
*  the testimony was that this woman said I've got him I've got it I've got her diaries I moved into [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2375.52s)]
*  the house where she was and I've got him is anyone interested and he was like we might be interested [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2381.2s)]
*  and had a discussion with her about possibly buying them but then decided not to but even if [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2386.08s)]
*  he had bought them and published them that's not illegal and and Joe Biden's DOJ knew that but they [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2391.2s)]
*  did his bidding and listen to the Politico article from which I read before okay listen to this [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2398.48s)]
*  these two critics are the latest to be swept up in Trump's expansive retribution campaign [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2406.7999999999997s)]
*  where he has sought to use federal powers in unprecedented ways to punish political opponents [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2411.68s)]
*  law firms university and others that he believes have wronged him oh it's totally unprecedented [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2418.48s)]
*  Politico and then they go on a president ordering investigations of specific individuals whom he [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2423.36s)]
*  considers to be his political enemies is a remarkable breach of the traditional wall of [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2429.92s)]
*  separation between the White House and the Justice Department I'm throwing up in my mouth and then [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2435.36s)]
*  under that norm of separation criminal investigations are supposed to be [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2441.6s)]
*  insulated from political pressure but Trump has repeatedly scorned the notion of DOJ independence [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2446.3199999999997s)]
*  that's why I say I don't care do it they they will not learn and the media will continue [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2454.64s)]
*  writing this bullshit so all the only hope for the side of normalcy who genuinely like you kick this [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2461.92s)]
*  conversation off with do not want to see this do not want to see the DOJ weaponized is to make them [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2469.84s)]
*  suffer I think we're calling this now the suck it manifesto that you've just laid out here and I [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2477.04s)]
*  think I'm proud to be part of the episode where where you laid that out first of all your [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2484.88s)]
*  approach is sounds a lot more fun than mine does and and I will say what you just outlined [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2490.48s)]
*  is completely on the right side of my dynamic that I outlined earlier I think that's justice [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2497.52s)]
*  you're talking about these are massive massive problems that happen in our justice system and [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2503.36s)]
*  there's so many examples you could have gone on all day with those I mean I I think about justice [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2508.88s)]
*  an hour on Trump and what they did to him yeah keep going exactly or for example the guy you [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2513.44s)]
*  were talking about Joe Biden and the people around him hiding the fact that he had lost all mental [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2518.7200000000003s)]
*  abilities while he was president of the United States I want an investigation on that too there [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2524.48s)]
*  was so much going on and the justice department's interference on the hunter Biden investigation [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2530.4s)]
*  trying to stop those two IRS whistleblowers from actually getting to the bottom of what he did [[00:42:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2536.0s)]
*  the weaponization the misuse of the DOJ has been in place now for at least the past four years [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2541.04s)]
*  thanks to Joe Biden politico where were you it doesn't work this way yeah and and by the way [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2547.2s)]
*  investigations are part of knowing this so if there is an investigation and maybe we find out [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2555.2s)]
*  that all these things are complete coincidences I don't think we will but if we do and that's [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2559.92s)]
*  that's the result that's the point I think we need to make sure that we don't go over the line just [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2565.68s)]
*  because we don't like this person or that person we shouldn't be charging people as you pointed out [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2570.24s)]
*  earlier with made-up charges or anything like that but this is out of control and I completely [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2574.96s)]
*  agree with you and I think it's completely consistent with the concept of justice to be [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2582.16s)]
*  able to go after these people really really hard if they did these things and to find out what [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2586.7200000000003s)]
*  actually happened you are right because I think there's in a way three approaches to this right [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2591.76s)]
*  there is this approach where you're getting revenge there's an approach where you're going [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2597.68s)]
*  for justice looking for it and then utilizing that result to the best of its ability to [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2601.44s)]
*  discourage this type of behavior later on and the third approach is the one we used to use and always [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2608.16s)]
*  did and I think this is the difference between Trump and many Republicans in the past that would [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2614.32s)]
*  just say okay and maybe even Trump about it honestly okay we're above it we're not going to [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2618.08s)]
*  do anything that was the past that was politics we all know that we're going to have a guy on that [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2622.32s)]
*  side later on so let's not go crazy we should make sure the people that did this are held [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2627.12s)]
*  responsible for it you've you've done great coverage of what happened during the COVID era [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2633.84s)]
*  that's another one we need to make sure people who are encouraging churches to be shut down [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2638.72s)]
*  we need to know who those people were how that process happened what emails what messages were [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2644.4s)]
*  sent to make these things that we were all so offended about we can all read books about it we [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2650.08s)]
*  can look at and say hey gosh you know this was really really bad and move on with our lives [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2655.04s)]
*  but that's not going to change things I don't I don't think we're saying we're talking different [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2659.12s)]
*  languages here you're just expressing it in a much more entertaining way well I'm I'm in favor of it [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2662.56s)]
*  I have to say it's I'm not in favor of charging somebody if the evidence is not there and I mean [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2668.4s)]
*  real evidence I don't mean just like colorable I mean like this person actually did appear to have [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2672.64s)]
*  committed a crime and you have to have a good faith belief in that as a prosecutor or you violated [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2676.8s)]
*  your ethics in bringing a case against them but do I have a problem with this guy miles taylor [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2680.32s)]
*  who was so self-aggrandizing we're keeping a lock on the president we the adults in the room [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2684.96s)]
*  will actually dictate us policy whether he knows it or not that now that trump's been re-elected [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2690.96s)]
*  trump's like you know what you've lost your access to your security clearance and I'm going to take [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2696.56s)]

*  by the way there is a happy ending on one of these stories I don't know where the thing is with Matt [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=2714.08s)]

*  doesn't corroborate it I mean I think there's real questions as to whether you should even [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3532.2400000000002s)]
*  cover an accusation like that when it's just an accusation and there's no other evidence corroborating [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3536.7200000000003s)]
*  it I mean just saying that about a person and the left loves to do this the media does it all the [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3542.64s)]
*  time where you know they'll just well this person said it all we're doing is reporting what they said [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3548.56s)]
*  well as a journalistic institution it's kind of your job to have a little bit more you might not [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3554.48s)]
*  be able to go through it in full investigation you don't have to necessarily hit some legal standard [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3560.64s)]

*  I think the filter they run it by is do we want this to be true yeah that's the beginning in the [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3570.16s)]
*  end of their investigation and a lot of these claims and the fact that they did or at least [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3576.64s)]
*  allegedly did an investigation that didn't corroborate it maybe made it seem like it wasn't [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3583.2s)]
*  true and still aired it is absolute I think hitting that standard of malice I mean that is [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3589.2799999999997s)]

*  sure I'm not just reporting junk because human beings are vulnerable to that type of thing [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3628.72s)]
*  it seems like all these organizations are living by a totally different standard and they just [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3633.44s)]
*  financially paid for that standard it's amazing because I mbc has a very well paid and well [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3639.2799999999997s)]

*  one year morning show over there and it was about Roger Ailes I think he died I think it was that [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3656.56s)]
*  he had died I can't remember to be honest but it was some I don't remember what year Roger died but [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3665.44s)]
*  it was shortly after I left Fox and it came up that he he had been involved in the Me Too thing [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3669.84s)]
*  and everything that happened at Fox and I was reading this script that said several women at [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3677.12s)]
*  Fox News accused him of sexual harassment including yours truly and then we moved on [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3682.96s)]
*  and they wanted me to insert he denied all claims including my own and I was like I'm not going to [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3688.48s)]
*  read that like I realize why don't you just have somebody else do it then like do it somebody like [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3697.2s)]
*  I'm not reading that I'm a fucking I know what happened I wrote a whole book about it there's [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3701.12s)]
*  like it's ridiculous the Murdochs like and they were like you will read it because it's what's [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3705.36s)]
*  fair to him and they look they weren't wrong it was just I was so freshly off of that whole thing [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3709.76s)]
*  I was like I'm not doing that I think I wound up reading like and and he denied it which was a [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3714.2400000000002s)]
*  false denial because it happened you know so I can't remember what I said but I remember sort of [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3720.2400000000002s)]
*  stealing the last word on it I only tell that story to reiterate that they're tough they're generally [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3724.48s)]
*  tough over there about maintaining some semblance of fairness especially on dicey [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3730.08s)]
*  legal matters like like a whistleblower coming out and saying something that is very clearly [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3736.16s)]
*  defamatory if true if not true very clearly defamatory if not true so I think you're exactly [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3740.16s)]
*  right this was too good it's like they're hurting immigrants they're stealing uteri [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3744.72s)]
*  and this guy rather than seeing him it's kind of like what happened to CNN we had on that plane if [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3751.92s)]
*  the guy who got defamed by CNN who was overseas in Afghanistan trying to help people get out [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3757.28s)]
*  and yes he charged a fee to help people get out was like in line with what the fees are to get [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3764.8s)]
*  out but like they they completely ripped this guy as though he was like profiting off of the pain [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3769.6800000000003s)]
*  of others like no this is a service you can get hired and you can big companies hire him to get [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3775.2000000000003s)]
*  like their people out and they made him seem like he was this opportunist and all these texts came [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3780.88s)]
*  in the litigation saying like he has a punchable face and they were mad that he called them back [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3786.9599999999996s)]
*  prior to the report to actually weigh in like they're like oh god now he's calling like no [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3792.9599999999996s)]
*  an honest reporter wants that you want the other side to be able to weigh in anyway it's just one [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3799.8399999999997s)]
*  of many examples that we've seen of corrupt media and that will bring me to John Oliver I don't know [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3805.68s)]
*  do we consider him media I don't know what the hell he is annoying and not fact-based though he [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3812.56s)]
*  purports to be I mean he thinks he's Walter Cronkite so he goes out on his show and he decides [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3819.04s)]
*  that he will be the final arbiter on whether men should be allowed to play in women's sports [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3826.88s)]
*  and decides to unleash this typical bullshit that we get from these leftists about how [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3833.04s)]
*  it's a very small number and who are they hurting you know who are they really hurting [[01:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3839.28s)]
*  and tries to get into like I couldn't find real studies showing without spending one minute to [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3844.96s)]
*  consider do you know why that is John Oliver it's because leftists are the ones who do these studies [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3850.4s)]
*  and no leftist magazine which is all of them every every magazine in the science field is [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3856.0s)]
*  controlled by leftists will get published if they run a piece saying biological men have an advantage [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3862.32s)]
*  over women that's the world we've been in for the past 15 years and by the way the studies aren't [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3868.8s)]
*  necessary anyway because we have eyes it's just absurd thank you so he decides it's not enough [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3874.88s)]
*  for him to just sort of state like this isn't an issue this is made up right wing you know catnip [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3881.84s)]
*  but then he starts to go through these I mean true these are feminists in the in the good sense of [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3887.52s)]
*  that word you know that word is it's not a good word and it I'm not a feminist but if you want to [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3894.08s)]
*  say to me like what's a real family like who's somebody who really stands up for women it's [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3898.88s)]
*  somebody like Riley Gaines who is actually fighting for women's rights or Peyton McNabb [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3902.7999999999997s)]
*  this the girl who at 16 in North Carolina was partially paralyzed by a volleyball headed her [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3908.3199999999997s)]
*  by a male that's an actual true like in the old school way of a feminist we're like not the man [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3912.96s)]
*  hatred not the radical abortion policies but like I just want women to to have their rights [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3918.96s)]
*  anyway those are his two favorite targets in this long monologue here he is on Riley Gaines [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3925.84s)]
*  she tied for fifth in the 200 free with Riley Gaines who catapulted to conservative stardom [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3934.0s)]
*  off the back of that race first that's a story about how Leah Thomas prevented Riley Gaines [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3939.6s)]
*  from getting fifth place instead of fifth place second those trophies look absolutely identical [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3943.84s)]
*  so just so we are clear Leah Thomas didn't take anything from Riley Gaines in fact you could [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3950.0s)]
*  argue she gave a lot to her as Gaines later decided to forego dental school in order to be [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3956.8s)]
*  an activist and speaker she now has her own advocacy center and has personally lobbied [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3962.4s)]
*  multiple state legislatures for bans all to address the threat posed to women's sports by [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3966.96s)]
*  women who swam exactly as fast as she did to the literal hundredth of a second [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3971.52s)]
*  you know what this is like this is like what is Denise Brown complaining about that Nicole [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3978.56s)]
*  Brown Simpson was murdered she became world famous and she's a big advocate now for domestic abuse [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3983.04s)]
*  fuck off John Oliver what so Riley Gaines has no legitimate complaint because she spoke out so [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3988.8s)]
*  effectively about what happened to her that she's become in effect a national spokesperson [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=3996.88s)]
*  on the issue so she should really be thankful that she had to take off her clothes and get nude in [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4002.56s)]
*  front of a fully intact male who is clearly if you review his social media an autogynophile who [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4008.88s)]
*  gets off on dressing like a woman and obviously parading around his fully intact penis in a [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4015.92s)]
*  women's locker room before he goes into the pool and steals their medals weirdly I missed [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4022.4s)]
*  that portion of John Oliver's monologues too gosh that is just irrefere sensible in so many ways [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4027.92s)]
*  I'm sure Ronald Goldman's dad was really excited about all the media attention that situation [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4036.1600000000003s)]
*  brought him as well thanks a lot OJ I mean absolutely fascinating and he goes on it basically [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4041.36s)]
*  you mentioned he can't find any studies what being alive is a study every world record in track and [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4047.92s)]
*  field is a study you don't need a study on this every single person on earth knows it to be true [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4056.5600000000004s)]
*  and it's so offensive and I will say this about John Oliver and I think he is really a unique [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4063.92s)]
*  person I think a lot of people who are on the right in particular don't even know who he is like you [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4069.6800000000003s)]
*  know he's just some guy you know some comedian what is he on HBO his YouTube videos get massive [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4073.68s)]
*  attention to the to the extent it's absurd like he will name a video lead and he'll put it out [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4079.7599999999998s)]
*  there and it's a 40 minute monologue on lead and it'll get three times as many views as he has [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4086.0s)]
*  followers which is millions I mean he really does get wide wide attention on the left and I think he [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4092.08s)]
*  is an incredible gift to conservatives he has a unique ability to be able to convince the left [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4097.12s)]
*  that their worst instincts are the only smart incredible position to follow like everything [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4106.4s)]
*  on the left everybody on the left should know the last thing they should do is be dying on the hill [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4113.68s)]
*  of men should be able to play in women's sports and he comes out here and condescends to the left to [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4118.96s)]
*  to an extent that they think they go to all their friends at work and say this is what I'm sticking [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4125.36s)]
*  with oh of course men and women should men should be able to play in women's sports and it puts them [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4129.2s)]
*  in a position politically and this does not make the situation right of course for the poor women [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4135.2s)]
*  who have to go through the situation but like politically he's he has this weird power over [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4139.2s)]
*  people on the left to convince them that they're the smart ones and everyone else is nuts and I [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4145.28s)]
*  don't know I don't think it does them any favors I don't want this to continue obviously but [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4149.92s)]
*  there is a certainly a political benefit at the very least for conservatives it's amazing to me [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4155.92s)]
*  how his entire monologue is told from the point of his own physical weakness like men are not [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4160.88s)]
*  stronger than women men cannot be like what are you worried about there's no physical advantage [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4166.08s)]
*  right not if you're the athlete John Oliver obviously because you just look like one big human [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4170.32s)]
*  turd of softness yes but but shockingly John Oliver there are men out there who go through [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4174.64s)]
*  normal male puberty you clearly weren't one of them who emerge on the opposite side full of [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4180.96s)]
*  testosterone and muscle you you should look around they're everywhere not in your mirror but elsewhere [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4185.6s)]
*  look around and Riley gains the the fact that she tied Leah Thomas for fifth and he's like it's the [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=4191.04s)]

*  so many military families sometimes don't always get that time but we had really [[01:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5331.52s)]
*  built a good foundation you know i don't think either of us had anticipated you know we thought [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5336.16s)]
*  about what if he was killed or you know all these other things and i'm pretty i'm pretty positive [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5343.44s)]
*  person so i did a pretty good job of pushing all of that but i don't think either of us ever [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5348.88s)]
*  anticipated you know getting severely wounded that just wasn't something that you know we had [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5353.76s)]
*  thought through or really prepared for so i don't know you know he he laughs but i feel like i kind [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5359.6s)]
*  of was in mom mode like i really didn't i didn't think about it so i think that we just had you [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5366.4800000000005s)]
*  know we had a really good strong foundation and we were fortunate for us when adversity hit [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5371.68s)]
*  i don't think i thought much about it i did did whatever needed to be done and i think that that [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5378.64s)]
*  made us stronger but there is we've seen it where there's so many couples that there's not that [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5384.48s)]
*  strong foundation they definitely don't seem to to make it through that right and then these poor [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5390.32s)]
*  guys have the loss of their love in addition to the loss of the life they knew and it's such a [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5396.5599999999995s)]
*  role reversal let's face it you know i mean when you marry a navy seal it's like i think generally [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5402.24s)]
*  like this very strong protector tough guy and you know you're going to be taken care of and then to [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5407.36s)]
*  see him severely wounded and you have to be the protector and the caregiver for a good long while [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5412.4s)]
*  of course jason never never saw life like that i'm sure because i just got to know him a little bit [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5418.879999999999s)]
*  but it is a role reversal and you can see how it could cause big disruption in even a good marriage [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5423.92s)]
*  but you see your book i mean it's about how do you save a marriage and how do you get past this this [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5430.24s)]
*  wasn't the biggest test of your marriage it was more after he got through the injuries and you [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5438.32s)]
*  know you tell me but it's more like jason this mental toughness this thing that led you guys to [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5444.48s)]
*  work on this jason gave me a copy of this note that he put outside his door hold on i'm actually [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5449.12s)]
*  sure the audience sees it um this like this mental toughness was very good and got jason through all [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5453.5199999999995s)]
*  those surgeries and so on but it had a downside and i would say from what i read that was more [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5461.5199999999995s)]
*  your toughest period can you i'll start with you on that jason what was it how would you describe [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5467.36s)]
*  what you were doing in your marriage that was not so great well i think uh for many of our warriors [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5471.36s)]
*  you know so many people want to focus on the physical wounds and obviously mine i wear on my [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5477.839999999999s)]
*  face so they really stand out i mean people oftentimes they look at amputations and things [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5482.24s)]
*  like that but so often it's the invisible wounds we carry i mean megan you nailed it i mean if a [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5486.88s)]
*  marriage comes to an end oftentimes a career comes to an end i mean really that individual is lost [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5492.32s)]
*  trying to find themselves and where they go from here and i was starting to encounter that although [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5497.679999999999s)]
*  i had a strong family i was now transitioning out of the military my seal career was ending and [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5502.16s)]
*  i'll be honest everything really was should have should be good i mean physically you know my [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5507.92s)]
*  surgeries were coming to an end and and i was i was on the path we had created a [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5513.36s)]
*  non-profit doing successful things our family was good but i don't know why i started to struggle [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5521.04s)]
*  mentally i you know a combination of post-traumatic stress and transition and you know in the protector [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5527.04s)]
*  community law enforcement fire and military that's a really hard time for us when you give up [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5533.5199999999995s)]
*  something that was so much part of your identity and now you're stepping into the second phase of [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5538.8s)]
*  your life and i wasn't managing it well i think the combination of some of the post-traumatic [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5544.08s)]
*  stress not sleeping the combination of the transition led me to self-medicate drink too [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5550.320000000001s)]
*  much and start pushing erica and my family away and she tried to allow me to figure that out which [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5557.68s)]
*  is so funny almost all of us do the same thing it's the opposite of what you should be doing [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5565.2s)]
*  you should be asking for help but that's hard for us we've always been we're the ones that go save [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5569.44s)]
*  other people so when we're the ones struggling it's very difficult to be vulnerable and say hey i'm [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5574.639999999999s)]
*  really struggling and i think erica recognized that we had built a strong enough foundation [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5581.2s)]
*  and she tried to give me time but she recognized i was kind of i was getting ready to drive off a [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5588.32s)]
*  cliff and she needed to do something and she was really smart and how she approached it and i think [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5594.08s)]
*  the way we had built ourselves that she knew how to approach it so that i would listen [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5599.5199999999995s)]
*  i mean it's so beautiful it's like it's very very strong of you to be able to admit that [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5605.92s)]
*  because it would be so much easier to say this is the this is the story it's all right here this is [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5612.48s)]
*  the story you know saying i should read it to the audience in part because it's just so amazing and [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5619.6s)]
*  then i'll finish making my point but this is what jason and erica hung outside of his hospital room [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5623.6s)]

*  own message and this was exactly the right headspace i think for you at the time and you both shared in [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5673.84s)]
*  it but then the second piece is so real it's so real as the kids say real where you get your body [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5678.64s)]
*  and your mental tenacity gets you through the the toughest period and then there's like [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5687.92s)]
*  a resettling and that can be the pain the most painful part and the fact that you're admitting [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5696.8s)]
*  it jason as a former navy seal that's going to help a lot of guys because they they might be [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5702.72s)]
*  going through it right now feeling weak or like they're the weak one everybody else was tough all [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5706.72s)]
*  along and never had this and the fact that you saw it erica and spoke up to it and actually said to [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5711.92s)]
*  him i don't want this to be the beginning of the end of our marriage and and that's what it's [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5719.84s)]
*  starting to feel like that's incredibly powerful it was such a shock and i know that babe i'll let [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5724.88s)]
*  you go in a second but i i think people need to understand number one the most dangerous battlefield [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5733.28s)]
*  will ever walk on is right here and number two i think people often say to us like hey you guys [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5737.759999999999s)]
*  are so lucky you know not everybody has what you have but we were very intentional it took years [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5746.5599999999995s)]
*  of building ourselves to get to that point and we had established a rule right from the very beginning [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5753.28s)]
*  it was part of our rules of engagement that we talked about in the book you never bring up divorce [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5759.12s)]
*  or the end i mean for us the end was death that was it so when erica said that in that car i felt [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5764.24s)]
*  like i'd been blown up mentally it's so shocked to me that that came out of her mouth that it it and [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5770.72s)]
*  it wasn't accusatory like hey you need to figure your beep out uh or i'm going to divorce you i mean [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5778.64s)]
*  it was it was so it was like a surgeon with a scalpel who made this tiny little surgical cut [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5785.2s)]
*  that penetrated my brain to say you got to do something here and i'll turn it over to her what [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5793.599999999999s)]
*  she was thinking yeah go ahead erica so going back to the sign on the door i was just gonna [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5800.08s)]
*  you know touch on that was such a pivotal thing during that time frame and because j is 99% of [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5806.24s)]
*  the time so positive and that sign absolutely shows that but that was such a huge thing and i just [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5816.639999999999s)]
*  think people should never underestimate the power of positivity it made it easier for me to support [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5824.16s)]
*  him and stand behind him not to say that every day was you know that we didn't have bad days [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5830.88s)]
*  that would there you know some days were a struggle i mean we had a lot of roadblocks but [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5836.96s)]
*  overall i mean we had music playing and everybody always said our room was like the fun room and um [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5842.0s)]
*  and i think that that's been throughout our relationship but definitely during that time [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5848.64s)]
*  and i think so many people can relate to years later when things weren't going right [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5853.92s)]
*  um the kids were good he was essentially done with surgeries the non-profit was doing well [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5859.360000000001s)]
*  everything was good um so so he should have been happy and you know i think we talked about a [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5865.52s)]
*  little bit the rules of engagement that we were so careful when we you know we were positive we [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5872.56s)]
*  didn't get into a fight and say um you know this is it i want to separate i want to divorce those [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5878.24s)]
*  were things that were off limits so i think that we had really built that foundation and we had [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5884.72s)]
*  the trust so that when i did you know kind of say if we don't if we don't do something different if [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5890.88s)]
*  you know if we don't fix this this will be the beginning of the end um it absolutely um [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5897.12s)]
*  you know took it you know he took that very seriously and i'm grateful that he took it [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5905.76s)]
*  serious and took action it was seismic and it was like tectonic plate moving because it was so off [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5912.08s)]
*  limits and i love that rules of engagement to put it in terms that most military vets can get um [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5918.8s)]
*  that the rules as i understand and my my husband and i have these same rules although i don't know [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5924.72s)]
*  we've ever like you know written them down like this but uh yes do not we always say don't make [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5929.2s)]
*  the relationship the stakes of any argument you know which is i think the same thing as what you [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5933.44s)]
*  guys are getting at uh no name calling totally agree we don't fight below the belt basically [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5937.04s)]
*  and i like you also have don't bring up past like transgressions do i have them am i missing one [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5942.72s)]
*  yeah you could never never say divorce or no ultimatums um yeah no name calling no uh no [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5950.96s)]
*  bringing up the past that's good that's that is what you're really saying and i got this from them [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5958.16s)]
*  i don't know them they said it publicly is uh the the famous kevin bacon kira sedgwick advice of [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5963.120000000001s)]
*  keep the sex dirty and the fights clean and it's it's kind of like a rule to live by [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5968.96s)]
*  in any good marriage right like when you're at your angriest is when you have to actually be [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5974.4800000000005s)]
*  have the most self-control in your day-to-day life because this is someone you love and you don't win [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5980.96s)]
*  if this person loses it's it's a net loss for the relationship for you for the family can you guys [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5987.44s)]
*  just pick up on that last point of like keeping the fights clean because you you actually do have [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5993.28s)]
*  a lot of good advice in here for arguments you know i think something we talk about is not only [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=5997.759999999999s)]
*  keeping the fights clean but also i think knowing your partner and knowing when to give space [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6006.5599999999995s)]
*  we talk a lot about giving space in the book and sometimes um you know jay can run rather rather [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6013.6s)]
*  hot i can get rather emotional so it's taking those cues when you know i definitely we definitely [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6021.4400000000005s)]
*  feel like you always need to address it so that you don't carry those arguments forward um but [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6028.08s)]
*  sometimes knowing when to say all right let's take let's take a little break and and come back to [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6034.400000000001s)]
*  address it because you're you're not getting anywhere at the moment well and one you know the [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6040.24s)]
*  thing that we were talking about a moment ago jason is really interesting to me because [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6045.2s)]
*  i think a lot of women have the same objections to their husband's behavior as erica had to yours [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6049.04s)]
*  even if the circumstances are totally different where they think the husband is too withdrawn [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6056.96s)]
*  and not sharing any of his stuff like men i think generally have a natural instinct to deal with it [[01:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6061.2s)]
*  on their own this is why the teenage suicide rate is super high in places like montana [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6067.76s)]
*  because in cowboy culture or military culture the message is cowboy up you know like you're fine and [[01:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6073.4400000000005s)]
*  the last instinct is to go cry on the wife's shoulder about the fact that you are definitely [[01:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6082.16s)]
*  not fine so like a lot of it like it was brave of erica to say i see you drifting away from me and i [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6088.16s)]
*  see you not talking to me and i can feel the separation like on a fundamental level and it [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6095.28s)]
*  was brave of you to say you're right so how did you get to that like there you know right now [[01:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6100.16s)]
*  there are other guys listening to this like i don't think i can talk about this yeah i mean and [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6107.2s)]
*  man the mental health crisis that's happening within not only our country but within the veteran [[01:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6114.5599999999995s)]
*  law enforcement and fire community is a problem and it's only exacerbated by in my opinion a [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6119.84s)]
*  little bit of the victim mindset so there's a balance that we need to have one it's okay to [[01:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6125.68s)]
*  say hey i'm struggling but number two it's on you you have to take action you know and i meet i talk [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6131.76s)]
*  about this oftentimes when i speak to organizations about mental health that you know linking everything [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6137.84s)]
*  back to different stories related to the military number one we call it a failed breach so when we're [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6143.52s)]
*  going into a building and we need to breach a door you know we'll use explosives or mechanical [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6151.52s)]
*  tools or whatever it is and if we don't succeed the first time it's called a failed breach well [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6157.68s)]
*  no one stops and suddenly goes oh we got a failed breach let's just quit and run away [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6162.8s)]
*  we have to continue to find the things that will work for you and that's what i try and encourage [[01:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6168.88s)]
*  you know any guy out there that's really struggling you have to figure out what works for you what [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6173.44s)]
*  worked for me this is why when erica said that to me i kind of went on a journey of man i did [[01:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6180.5599999999995s)]
*  counselors i did chaplains i did all kinds of different therapies to figure out how to heal [[01:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6186.16s)]
*  myself and navigate through that and i meet other guys that'll say well i tried what you tried and [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6191.599999999999s)]
*  that didn't work for me well and i'd be like well how many other things did you try and they'd be [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6197.2s)]
*  like that's it and i'm like well why would you i mean you train your entire career on how to [[01:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6200.96s)]
*  problem solve and create contingencies and attack things from five different angles if the first [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6206.08s)]
*  floor didn't work so why are you approaching this in the same way so it's just um you got to [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6210.96s)]
*  communicate and number two you got to figure out what works for you and if it doesn't work the first [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6217.36s)]
*  time you got to attack it from different angles the other thing i love that you guys do and are [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6222.8s)]
*  recommending for people in the book again invincible marriage is called mission invincible marriage [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6228.16s)]

*  are stressful or if there's tension um it is it is kind of just a great way that kind of makes [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cmFH-J3ywog&t=6308.8s)]
