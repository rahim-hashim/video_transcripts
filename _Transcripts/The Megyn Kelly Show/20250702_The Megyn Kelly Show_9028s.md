Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Howard Blum, author of "When the Night Comes Falling," and legal expert Matt Murphy to discuss the depravity of the Idaho murders as Kohberger takes a plea deal, the disconnect between the prosecution and the victim’s families, whether this feels like justice for the victims, the most extraordinary moments during the plea hearing, the prosecution’s failure to pursue the death penalty after insisting they had the evidence for it, questions around the ethics of the decision to allow the plea to happen, the anger at least one Idaho victim family feels at the prosecution, the prosecutor's performative tearing up while talking, the judge mispronouncing the name of one of the victims, speculation that Kohberger wanted the plea deal to save his parents from testifying, whether Kohberger might be able to get out of jail eventually, and more.

# Bryan Kohberger SPEAKS and Admits He's Guilty of Murders During Plea Hearing - Megyn Kelly Reacts
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE)
*  Welcome back to the Megyn Kelly show, everyone. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=0.0s)]
*  It was two and a half years ago, almost exactly, that Brian Kohlberger moved to Washington [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6.44s)]
*  State to pursue his PhD and to act as a teacher's assistant in teaching other students studying [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=14.16s)]
*  criminal justice. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=23.56s)]
*  No one knew at that time, perhaps not even Brian Kohlberger, that he would become the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=25.76s)]
*  subject of the criminal justice system himself after committing four homicides in the course [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  of 12 minutes in November of 2022 on the neighboring University of Idaho campus. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=35.480000000000004s)]
*  In moments, he's expected to walk into an Idaho courthouse, the Ada County courthouse [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=42.64s)]
*  in Boise, Idaho, and plead guilty to all four of those murders. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=47.56s)]
*  Two 20 year olds, two 21 year olds, while some of them were sleeping in their beds [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=52.92s)]
*  and others were about to go to sleep. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=58.02s)]
*  We will have the live feed. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=60.68s)]
*  We have it. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=62.120000000000005s)]
*  We can see it now. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  Right now, it's not showing anything. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=64.12s)]
*  So as soon as it does, we're going there live. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=65.12s)]
*  We're going to watch it live together. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=66.68s)]
*  We won't be talking. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=68.4s)]
*  We'll be watching. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=69.4s)]
*  And then we will have instant analysis on the back end or where there's any pausing [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=70.72s)]
*  that allows it with Matt Murphy, lifetime prosecutor, along with Howard Bloom, who's [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=76.52000000000001s)]
*  he's owned this story from the start and others as we get started. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=82.0s)]
*  So we're going to watch it. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=86.28s)]
*  We'll tell you what's been happening outside of the courthouse and an inn as we await what [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=88.0s)]
*  what's going to be. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  Let's face it, a dramatic moment in legal history. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=95.08000000000001s)]
*  This guy's been telling us since he was arrested in December 2022. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=98.42s)]
*  It wasn't me. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=102.32000000000001s)]
*  It wasn't me. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=103.80000000000001s)]
*  I will be exonerated. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=105.42s)]
*  Remember, he didn't just say found not guilty. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=106.42s)]
*  I'm innocent. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=109.4s)]
*  He said I'll be exonerated through his first lawyer. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=110.48s)]
*  But he wouldn't actually speak. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=114.0s)]
*  We haven't heard him speak when he entered his not guilty plea. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=115.48s)]
*  He kept he remained silent and the judge had to do it for him. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=119.16000000000001s)]
*  It's very rare we hear him say anything. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=122.94000000000001s)]
*  Some things in passing at a couple of court hearings. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=124.7s)]
*  But today we are expected. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=126.56s)]
*  We are expecting to hear him say guilty, guilty, guilty and to confirm the bare minimum details [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=128.20000000000002s)]
*  about the crimes. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=134.56s)]
*  We do not believe that he's going to have to offer any explanation or motive. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=136.28s)]
*  It's possible this judge has done it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  This court has done it with other defendants. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=144.12s)]
*  But there's no promises here and the odds are against it. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=148.32s)]
*  Nothing's written in the deal that would require it, which would suggest he's not going to [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=151.6s)]
*  do it. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=154.92000000000002s)]
*  But we'll see. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  We'll see. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=156.92000000000002s)]
*  We might also hear from the families of the victims. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  We've had prosecutors tell us that even at this stage, that would be something you would [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=160.24s)]
*  We don't know how it's going to work inside of this Idaho courtroom. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=165.84s)]
*  The family of Kaylee Goncalves, her dad, Steve, is enraged. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=170.44s)]
*  This is the family of Ethan Chapin that will show walking into the courthouse moments ago. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=176.72s)]
*  Ethan was just 20 years old when murdered. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=181.44s)]
*  He was a triplet. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=184.2s)]
*  Two of those pictured there, clearly his brother and sister, who are also at the University [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=185.2s)]
*  of Idaho. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=190.32s)]
*  Having to go back to school with your triplet brother murdered. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=192.32s)]
*  The family did release a statement saying they support this plea bargain. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=197.79999999999998s)]
*  They've been in, I don't know, for lack of a better word, a gentler place about this, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=201.51999999999998s)]
*  I think, from the beginning. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Most of their statements from the beginning have been, I don't know, they don't seem in [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  the angry place as much as Steve is. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=214.28s)]
*  I say that not judgmentally at all. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  You guys know me. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=217.95999999999998s)]
*  I'm fine with some anger. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=219.32s)]
*  And I just feel like what Steve Goncalves is feeling is what most parents would feel. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=221.4s)]
*  It must be very, very hard to take the high road and say, okay, we'll settle for life [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=228.35999999999999s)]
*  in prison. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=237.0s)]
*  I just feel like if I were Steve Goncalves, if I were, God forbid, in his position, I'd [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=238.92s)]
*  be saying what he's saying. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=243.95999999999998s)]
*  He's outraged. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=245.2s)]
*  He's furious with the prosecution for cutting this deal over the family's objections. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=246.2s)]
*  Not all of them, as I point out, the Chapins are for it. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=251.56s)]
*  One parent of Maddie Mogin, who was asleep and the best friend of Kaylee Goncalves and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=254.72s)]
*  also murdered, one parent has said he supports this deal. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=262.24s)]
*  We haven't heard from Xanacronodal's parents, and we haven't heard from Maddie Mogin's [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=268.28s)]
*  mother. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=272.03999999999996s)]
*  We've heard from the father who said he's okay. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=273.12s)]
*  They're divorced. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=274.6s)]
*  But we expect a statement from her mother after today's proceedings. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=275.8s)]
*  And perhaps Xanacronodal has always been the most elusive person in this story to get information [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=280.24s)]
*  about her mom. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=286.64000000000004s)]
*  I don't really know much about her. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=288.24s)]
*  And we don't know. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=290.96000000000004s)]
*  I don't think we'd even know her family if we saw them as they're walking in. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  It's 1-0-5. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=295.76s)]
*  They're not opening the feed yet. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=297.52000000000004s)]
*  But just so you know, this court, they allow cameras in the courtrooms in Idaho State Court, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=299.16s)]
*  which is where this is going down. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  There was quite a bit of bargaining over how the camera would be positioned during the [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=307.28000000000003s)]
*  Kohlberger trial, which was set to start. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=311.44000000000005s)]
*  Jury selection was going to begin the beginning of August. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=314.64000000000004s)]
*  And they ultimately settled on one camera at the back of the courthouse, like sort of [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=317.56s)]
*  focused on the witness stand. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=320.72s)]
*  We don't know what to expect for the plea or how this will be positioned. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=322.0s)]
*  And I certainly hope that they're allowing the camera to be positioned on the defendant [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=326.24s)]
*  as he speaks. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=332.68s)]
*  And we hear him take ownership of this horrific act. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=335.72s)]
*  Steve Gonsalves saying outside of court a moment ago, he's not going in. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=341.92s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=345.64s)]
*  Who knows whether he'll change his mind. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=346.76s)]
*  He still has some time. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=348.24s)]
*  He was outside the courthouse telling reporters that prosecutors made a deal with the devil, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=350.08s)]
*  that he's not going in the courtroom to watch that devil. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=355.96s)]
*  And he also alluded to Kohlberger's family, we are assuming here, possibly being made [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=359.71999999999997s)]
*  aware of this plea deal ahead of the victims' families. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=365.12s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=370.59999999999997s)]
*  Do you have any message for Kohlberger's family? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=371.59999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, what do you want Kohlberger to know? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=374.59999999999997s)]
*  We know when you flew out here. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=376.28s)]
*  We know, we know. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=377.91999999999996s)]
*  We have your flight records. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=379.91999999999996s)]
*  How are you preparing to see him today? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=380.91999999999996s)]
*  I'm not going to see him. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=383.91999999999996s)]
*  When you say you know the flight records, what do you mean, Steve? [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=385.92s)]
*  I know when his parents booked their flight. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=389.0s)]
*  When his father did. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=391.0s)]
*  What does that mean? [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=393.0s)]
*  You'll find out. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=395.0s)]
*  Would you like to say something to them? [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=397.0s)]
*  No, I don't care about it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=399.0s)]
*  The rest of your family went inside. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=401.0s)]
*  Is it important for them to be in there today? [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=405.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=409.0s)]
*  Where are you going? [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=410.0s)]
*  Are you not able to get in? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=411.0s)]
*  I'm just getting out of this suit. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=412.0s)]
*  You're not staying in? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  No, not for me. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=415.47999999999996s)]
*  Who can second-guess him? [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=420.47999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I'm sure it's going to be stomach-turning for all of them to even lay eyes on this monster. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=421.47999999999996s)]
*  Court TV reporting that people were lining up at 4 a.m. outside of the courthouse to [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=430.48s)]
*  try to get a seat inside. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=435.48s)]
*  It's one of those cases that has captured the attention of the nation just because it's [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=438.48s)]
*  so horrific. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=442.48s)]
*  My kids know about this one. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=444.76s)]
*  Your kids don't normally get into true crime, but in my son's high school, he's a freshman, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=446.76s)]
*  now he's going into sophomore, but they were talking about it. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=453.76s)]
*  He wound up doing a presentation on it because they were all so interested in this and he [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=455.76s)]
*  was just willing to do the work on getting the facts. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=460.76s)]
*  Everyone was fascinated. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=464.76s)]
*  It's just beyond. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=466.76s)]
*  It sort of escapes the normal bounds of what you understand a human's capable of. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=470.03999999999996s)]
*  We know that there are murderers. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=475.03999999999996s)]
*  We know that there are serial killers. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=476.03999999999996s)]
*  We know that there are horrible men out there who will torture people. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=478.03999999999996s)]
*  I mean, it's sometimes women, but let's face it, the vast majority are men. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=482.03999999999996s)]
*  But we've never seen a crime where in 12 minutes, four able-bodied, beautiful, everything [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=486.03999999999996s)]
*  in front of them, young people were stabbed to death and two surviving roommates didn't [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=494.32s)]
*  hear anything, didn't see anything, didn't also get attacked. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=499.32s)]
*  I mean, the whole thing was so bizarre and he was well on his way toward having a successful [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=504.32s)]
*  life. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=509.32000000000005s)]
*  His professor at his college in Pennsylvania, Catherine Ramsland, was set to take the stand [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=510.32000000000005s)]
*  in this case for the prosecution. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=519.32s)]
*  And she's the one who recommended him to Washington State for the PhD program with a glowing recommendation [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=522.6s)]
*  that he got his master's at her college in Pennsylvania. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=529.6s)]
*  And she's like one of the people when it comes to criminal justice and these forensic [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=532.6s)]
*  examinations of crime scenes and criminals. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=540.6s)]
*  And she sat down with Brian Enton of News Nation last night and was fascinating. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=544.6s)]
*  The whole thing was fascinating, including her talking about, well, let's just go through [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=551.88s)]
*  it as we wait for the live feed to come from this Idaho courtroom. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=556.88s)]
*  She starts off by saying what her initial impression of Kohlberger was, SOP 42. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=560.88s)]
*  What was your perception of him? [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=567.88s)]
*  He seemed like eager to be in the classroom. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=572.88s)]
*  He was polite. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=577.08s)]
*  He was respectful, intense and curious. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=578.76s)]
*  And there was no reason for me to think that he was anything other than someone who was [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=583.76s)]
*  really interested in this potential career. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=588.76s)]
*  OK, that's how she kicked it off. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=594.76s)]
*  And then she got to what it was like when she found out he'd been charged and whether [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=597.26s)]
*  she looks back now on what she taught him in a different way. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=602.9599999999999s)]
*  OK, I'm going to bring in our panel as we wait now. [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=606.84s)]
*  Again, it's Matt Murphy. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=608.84s)]
*  Matt's a former homicide prosecutor, lifetime. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=609.84s)]
*  That's how he spent his adult years putting terrible people in jail. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=612.84s)]
*  So good on him. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=616.84s)]
*  And author of the book, The Book of Murder and Howard Bloom, who is the journalist to [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=617.84s)]
*  follow on this case since the very beginning. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=622.88s)]
*  He's also the author of the book When the Night Comes Falling, a requiem for the Idaho [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  student murders, which is now out in paperback. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=630.16s)]
*  Highly recommend if you have any interest in this case. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=632.84s)]
*  Howard, welcome back. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you for being here. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=636.9200000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=637.9200000000001s)]
*  Let me just give you another additional bit of color. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=639.9200000000001s)]
*  Brian Enton reporting from News Nation in Idaho in the line outside the courtroom waiting [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=642.9200000000001s)]
*  to go in. [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=648.08s)]
*  They have us up against the wall to make room for the victims families as they walk by to [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=649.08s)]
*  enter. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=653.4s)]
*  Everyone is silent. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=654.9s)]
*  I'm so sad for them. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=656.0s)]
*  You can only imagine the level of decorum you would try to offer these families as they [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=657.6s)]
*  walk into that courtroom. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=665.24s)]
*  I mean, the the amount of sobriety you would try to bring to that moment as an onlooker, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=666.24s)]
*  as a journalist, as a lawyer, Matt, you've been there. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=673.0s)]
*  You've been the prosecutor in this exact circumstance. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=676.3199999999999s)]
*  Try to try to set the scene for us. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=681.0799999999999s)]
*  Well, this is obviously a tremendously somber moment. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=683.88s)]
*  The prosecution outlined some some good points on why you might offer a plea for a case like [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=690.36s)]
*  this. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=698.84s)]
*  The appellate process goes on forever. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=699.84s)]
*  That's true. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=702.0400000000001s)]
*  The families have to go through it and trial. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=703.44s)]
*  Of course, that's true. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=706.32s)]
*  But that's the case in every single murder. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=707.6800000000001s)]
*  They're all brutal. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=710.6400000000001s)]
*  And if you give the family a heads up as a prosecutor, but having them having them come [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=711.6400000000001s)]
*  in, one of the things that's disturbing to me about this case, Megan, of course, is the [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=716.28s)]
*  disconnect that appears to have taken place between the prosecution and at least the Gonzalez [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=720.48s)]
*  family. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=725.5600000000001s)]
*  And in a in a word, that really should never happen. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=727.2s)]
*  Sometimes it's unavoidable. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=732.64s)]
*  It appears that certainly some of these family members are on board with this plea. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=733.96s)]
*  Again, there's good reasons for that. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=737.64s)]
*  But every family, Megan, is that you deal with on a in a murder case is somewhere on [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=740.06s)]
*  a spectrum between profound sadness and profound anger. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=746.22s)]
*  And they all sort of wind up and they can they evolve over time, typically. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=751.02s)]
*  And Mr. Gonzalez clearly and I think for the entire pendency of this case has been very [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=757.02s)]
*  much on the anger side of the spectrum. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=761.86s)]
*  Like you said, who can blame them? [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=763.54s)]
*  There are different rules in Idaho than many other states that have what's called Marcy's [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=767.02s)]
*  law. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=771.74s)]
*  And in California, for example, the family has a constitutional right, the immediate [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=772.74s)]
*  family members to address the court, to to address the defendant and to talk about the [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=777.9000000000001s)]
*  impact that this had on their family. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=784.34s)]
*  And this is one of those things that the plea or just before sentencing at the pleading, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=786.86s)]
*  like the day that he cops the plea or at the sentencing under Marcy's law, which is also [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=791.1s)]
*  known as the Victims Bill of Rights. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=795.9s)]
*  They have a right to address the court each and every time there is a significant event [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=797.5s)]
*  in a courtroom. So any oh, wow, significant procedural event in a courtroom, the family [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=801.98s)]
*  has the right to address the judge and to address the defendant if they're present. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=809.06s)]
*  So it's a powerful thing. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=813.18s)]
*  Idaho attempted to adopt this in 2019 and they didn't for whatever reason. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=815.42s)]
*  And you can you can mark my words on this, I predict, after this case, there's going [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=820.22s)]
*  to be a renewed push to adopt Marcy's law in the state of Idaho. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=825.74s)]
*  And we don't know exactly what to expect when it comes to the family. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=829.74s)]
*  Howard, your thoughts on this? We haven't gotten your opinion or just to talk to you [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=833.26s)]
*  since the news broke that he's cutting the plea. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=836.9s)]
*  I mean, I think the prosecution made a very pragmatic but ultimately cynical decision. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=839.5s)]
*  I mean, all along in this case, we've seen the authorities in Idaho trying to move on. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=847.14s)]
*  Remember, Judge Judge, he couldn't wait to leave the case to get off of it. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=853.02s)]
*  Then when Judge Hippler came in, the first thing he said his first day in the courtroom, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=858.14s)]
*  I'd like to say I'm happy to be here, but I'm not. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=862.22s)]
*  And then the University of Idaho, they wanted the whole town to forget about it. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=865.0600000000001s)]
*  They they insisted that the murder house should be torn down. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=868.34s)]
*  And then you had Chief Fry, who was running the investigation. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=871.58s)]
*  Howard, it's starting. Let's go there live. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=874.0600000000001s)]
*  Stand by. Waiting. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=881.34s)]
*  It's coming. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=882.74s)]
*  Just FYI, we're seeing inside the courtroom, we can see the judge just shuffling papers at his desk. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=903.62s)]
*  And we are seeing. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=909.5s)]
*  All right. This is CR 012431 665. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=910.66s)]
*  The defendant is present in custody with counsel, Miss Thompson, Miss Jennings, [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=915.1s)]
*  and pardon me, Miss Taylor, Miss Massoth and Miss Barlow. [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=921.38s)]
*  The state's present with Mr. Thompson, Mr. Horowitz, Miss Jennings. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=925.46s)]
*  And Mr. Nye is here as well. Miss anybody? I'm sorry. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=933.86s)]
*  Miss Allen is here as well. Miss Allen is here as well. Very well. Thank you. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=943.86s)]
*  All right. We are here today to entertain a change of plea. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=947.14s)]
*  Before I start, I want to address some issues of concern and otherwise. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=953.7s)]
*  First, I appreciate everybody in attendance today being on their best behavior. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=963.54s)]
*  Please no outbursts or demonstrations. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=969.34s)]
*  Any such conduct will result in immediate removal and may result in an inability to attend further court proceedings in this case. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=972.22s)]
*  I want to point out that there have been calls by some for the public to contact me and my office in an attempt to influence my decision making in this case. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=984.22s)]
*  This has been extraordinarily disruptive for court staff and the ability for them to get work done, not only in this case, but in other cases where defendants are entitled to [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=996.34s)]
*  have their cases processed and frankly as important, if not more so for victims, to have their cases processed in those cases. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1010.5s)]
*  It's also highly inappropriate. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1022.5s)]
*  A court is not supposed to and this court will never take into account public sentiment in making an opinion regarding its judicial decisions in cases. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1025.06s)]
*  Courts should and I always will make decisions based on where the facts and the law lead me. Period. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1042.06s)]
*  I have not read any of the numerous messages nor listened to any of the numerous voicemails that have been sent to me and my staff. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1050.62s)]
*  Those have all been forward to security and where appropriate to law enforcement. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1059.62s)]
*  I ask that you not continue to mount such campaigns or to send me information like this because again it is not appropriate and frankly not something I would take into account [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1066.62s)]
*  when deciding a matter in a case like this. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1078.1799999999998s)]
*  I also want people to understand some very basic concepts about the ideas of separation of powers, what the court's duties are and what the duties and the rights of the executive or in this case the prosecuting attorney is. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1085.1799999999998s)]
*  The executive, the elected prosecutor is the sole authority in deciding what charges to pursue, [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1100.74s)]
*  including whether as well as what penalties to ask for and what penalties to pursue including the death penalty. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1111.74s)]
*  This court cannot require the prosecutor to seek the death penalty nor would it be appropriate for this court to attempt to do that. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1121.3s)]
*  This court in considering a plea agreement, if it were to reject this plea agreement, cannot force the state to seek the death penalty. [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1133.3s)]
*  My role and power in considering a plea agreement is extremely limited. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1143.86s)]
*  My role is to ensure that the defendant's plea is given freely, voluntarily and intelligently. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1149.86s)]
*  If those things are met, I can only reject a plea such as the one in this case where I'm not being asked to agree to the sentence in advance. [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1157.86s)]
*  If I can only reject it, for example, if the defendant does not meet or admit to all of the elements of the crime. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1169.4199999999998s)]
*  That is, I can ensure what is called a factual basis to the plea. [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1181.4199999999998s)]
*  Finally, I want to offer my apologies to all the families, including the victim's families, the families of the defendant for the short notice for today's hearing [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1186.98s)]
*  and I'm sure what must have been the hurried efforts to get here. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1196.98s)]
*  I, like most everyone else, learned of this plea agreement. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1201.98s)]
*  Monday afternoon and had no inkling of it beforehand. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1207.54s)]
*  Prior to that time, I was under the belief that this case was proceeding to trial as had been indicated and my staff and I were busy continuing to work on preparations to have potentially 10,000 citizens of eight or 10,000 people to be sent to trial. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1213.54s)]
*  The case was proceeding to trial as had been indicated and my staff and I were busy continuing to work on preparations to have potentially 10,000 citizens of Ada County come to jury duty starting in mid July. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1227.1s)]
*  With the questionnaire process in mid July. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1243.1s)]
*  Once I learned of the defendant's decision to change his plea in this case, it was important that I take the plea as soon as possible because of the extraordinary administrative efforts that were otherwise attendant to the process of getting this trial potentially underway on time [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1246.6599999999999s)]
*  and including the significant process of bringing again potentially up to 10,000 jurors to come in and fill out juror questionnaires prior to the beginning of the voir dire process. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1262.22s)]
*  And so it was important that we, that we were able to get the court to come in and fill out the questionnaire process. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1274.22s)]
*  And so I was able to get the court to come in and fill out the questionnaire process. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1284.22s)]
*  And so, if we're going to go down this road, do so expeditiously so that we can avoid those costs and expenses associated with that. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1292.22s)]
*  Otherwise, if it was not going to result in a plea or for some reason the plea were to fall through today that we could continue diligently towards trial at the time specified. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1306.22s)]
*  And so that obviously required that we act quickly and so some folks may have not had the amount of time that we would otherwise allow for for them to travel here. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1315.78s)]
*  And so again, I apologize for that. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1330.78s)]
*  I want to make people aware that during the hearing if you are to leave the courtroom for any reason you will not be readmitted during the hearing. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1334.34s)]
*  Also, when we finished the hearing this morning, I asked that the public and media wait in their seats until the victims' families and the defendant's families and others are escorted out of the courtroom before you start to leave. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1348.34s)]
*  Finally, I want to acknowledge the trial court administrator and her staff, the Ada County Sheriff and Ada County 4th District Marshal Service for the huge lift that they've accomplished in preparing for and orchestrating this hearing today. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1364.34s)]
*  As well as to all the security attendant today that you see and some of whom you, many of whom you don't see, with less than 48 hours notice. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1380.34s)]
*  And so I appreciate the hard work that they've been doing. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1389.8999999999999s)]
*  Frankly, some of them while they were on some vacation prior to the trial starting and had to call that short. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1393.8999999999999s)]
*  And so I appreciate very much their professionalism and dedication. [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1399.8999999999999s)]
*  All right. That said, let's move to the business of today. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1405.8999999999999s)]
*  I understand the state and the defense have reached a plea agreement in this case. [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1411.8999999999999s)]
*  For the record, I have a written plea agreement which indicates in sum, the defendant will plead guilty to all five counts in the indictment, burglary, felony, and first degree murder, four counts. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1419.8999999999999s)]
*  The state and the defendant stipulate, that is, that the defense is not free to argue for a lesser sentence at sentencing, to the following. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1439.46s)]
*  The defendant on the burglary charge will be sentenced to 10 years fixed. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1451.46s)]
*  And that the defendant on counts two through five, the four counts of first degree homicide on each count would receive a fixed life sentence. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1456.46s)]
*  All five of those counts to run consecutive to one another. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1465.46s)]
*  Defendant, as part of the plea agreement, waives his right to appeal, as well as his right to appeal the sentence, and his right to seek leniency or reconsideration of the sentence under Idaho Criminal Rule 35. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1469.46s)]
*  This is not a rule 11 agreement, meaning the court is not bound by the plea agreement and could impose a different lawful sentence at sentencing. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1486.02s)]
*  The stipulated agreement between the parties is the maximum on each count, so theoretically the only thing the court could do would be a lesser sentence at sentencing. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1501.02s)]
*  But the defendant is not free to ask the court to do so under the plea agreement. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1511.02s)]
*  Are there any other material terms of the plea agreement that the parties would like to make? Obviously the written plea agreement will speak for itself and be part of the court record. [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1516.02s)]
*  Not from the state, Your Honor. Thank you. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1526.02s)]
*  No, Your Honor. Thank you. [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1528.02s)]
*  All right. Very well. [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1530.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1531.58s)]
*  Ms. Taylor, have you had sufficient time to discuss this case and all of its ramifications with your client? [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1537.58s)]
*  I have, Your Honor. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1546.58s)]
*  Have you discussed fully with him his rights, defenses, and possible consequences to him of the guilty plea? [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1548.58s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1553.58s)]
*  Have you been able to do all the discovery you feel necessary? [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1555.58s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1557.58s)]
*  And have you informed your client of the importance of providing the court truthful and accurate answers in taking this plea today? [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1559.1399999999999s)]
*  I have. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1566.1399999999999s)]
*  Have you apprised your client of any and all offers and counter offers and answered his questions about those? [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1568.1399999999999s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1573.1399999999999s)]
*  Do you consent to the entry of the plea today? [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1574.1399999999999s)]
*  I do. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1575.1399999999999s)]
*  All right. Mr. Koberger, I need to ask you some questions this afternoon, or I guess it's this morning still. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1577.1399999999999s)]
*  I do this to ensure that you understand, so that I am assured that you understand the nature of the charges to which I understand you're going to plead guilty as well as the possible consequences to you of your guilty pleas. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1582.7s)]
*  I want to make sure your plea is given voluntarily, and I want to make sure that you actually committed the crimes to which you're pleading guilty, because I don't want you to plead guilty to a crime you didn't commit. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1595.7s)]
*  If you attempt to plead guilty today, but for some reason I don't accept your plea, then it is possible that your statements today could be used against you later at trial. Do you understand that? [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1605.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1617.26s)]
*  All right. Thank you. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1618.26s)]
*  And while you're standing, actually, why don't you take the oath from the clerk? [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1620.26s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1623.82s)]
*  Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you shall give in the matter, not even before the court, shall it be received, but that it be done in that conduct, so it may be done? [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1625.82s)]
*  Yes. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1635.82s)]
*  All right. And Mr. Koberger, just to make it easier, you don't need to stand when you speak to me. I appreciate the sign of respect, but for convenience you can remain seated, all right? [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1637.82s)]
*  Before I start asking questions today, have you consumed substance of questions? Let me ask you, have you consumed any alcohol, drug, or other intoxicating substance that would impair your ability to understand or exercise reasonable judgment? [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1647.3799999999999s)]
*  No. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1666.3799999999999s)]
*  You feel like you are thinking clearly today? [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1668.3799999999999s)]
*  All right. I want you to understand what the possible penalties are for each of the crimes to which I understand you're going to offer a guilty plea today. [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1669.94s)]
*  They include on count one, the burglary, a fine of up to $50,000, and a period of incarceration of up to 10 years in the state penitentiary. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1678.94s)]
*  You may be required to pay restitution to any victims of the crime. Count two, three, four, and five for first degree murder. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1687.5s)]
*  The consequences include a fine of up to $50,000, a period of incarceration of life imprisonment, which is a requirement of a sentence, that it be a life sentence, [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1697.5s)]
*  with a mandatory minimum sentence of at least 10 years on each of those counts. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1711.06s)]
*  In addition, you would be potentially responsible for a fine of up to $5,000 to each of the victims of your crime, to be enforced in the form of a civil judgment, to operate as additional punishment. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1718.06s)]
*  This is in excess of any restitution or fines that the court could order. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1735.62s)]
*  And again, you may be required to pay restitution to the victims of the crime. [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1742.62s)]
*  You would be required to provide, as to counts one, two, three, four, and five, a DNA sample and a right thumbprint impression, and potentially pay for analysis of those samples. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1746.62s)]
*  You would lose any right to possess, purchase, or carry a firearm, the right to serve on jury duty, the right to hold public office, and the right to vote. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1758.1799999999998s)]
*  Do you understand the charges and all those possible consequences? [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1766.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1769.1799999999998s)]
*  You've heard the plea agreement that I talked about today. Do you agree with that plea agreement? [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1780.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1786.1799999999998s)]
*  And do you understand the nature of the charges that you've been charged with that I understand you're going to plead guilty today, too? [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1788.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1796.1799999999998s)]
*  As I indicated, I'm not bound by the plea agreement, but the plea agreement is for the maximum on each count. Do you understand that I'm not bound by the plea agreement? [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1803.1799999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1812.1799999999998s)]
*  Has anyone promised you that I would be lenient or easy on you if you plead guilty? [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1813.74s)]
*  No. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=1818.74s)]

*  the public may be familiar with from the probable cause affidavit and other documents. [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2344.62s)]
*  The state's evidence as an overview would show that back in March of 2022, when the [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2350.34s)]
*  defendant was residing at his parents' residence or was residing back in Pennsylvania in his home state, [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2356.98s)]
*  he purchased online a K-Bar knife and sheath with an Amazon gift card that he had purchased [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2362.62s)]
*  shortly prior to the purchase of the knife, sheath, and sharpener. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2367.38s)]
*  Jumping ahead, the end of June of that year, the defendant, Mr. Koberger, moved from Pennsylvania [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2371.94s)]
*  to Pullman, Washington, which is right across the state line from Moscow, Idaho, for the [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2379.34s)]
*  purpose of pursuing a Ph.D. in criminal justice at Washington State University. [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2384.06s)]
*  The state's evidence would indicate that beginning July 9th of 2022, Mr. Koberger's phone began [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2390.02s)]
*  connecting to a cell tower that serves the area of the 1122 King Road residence in Moscow, Idaho. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2397.64s)]
*  Now I will acknowledge for the court and all present that there are many residences in [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2405.5s)]
*  that area. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2409.98s)]
*  It's a dense population of mostly college-related occupants. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2410.98s)]
*  Between July 9th of 2022 and November 7th, the defendant's phone connected to that particular [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2416.18s)]
*  tower during late night, early morning hours, 10 p.m. to 4 a.m., on approximately 23 times. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2423.98s)]
*  Now I will acknowledge also we do not have evidence that the defendant had direct contact [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2431.86s)]
*  with 1122 or with residents of 1122, but we can put his phone in that area on those times. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2437.62s)]
*  In the interim, on August 22nd of 2022, Laetaw County Sheriff's Deputy, Darren Duke, conducted [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2445.22s)]
*  a traffic stop in the early morning hour or late evening hours, about 11 p.m., on the [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2451.66s)]
*  west side of Moscow, on the Moscow-Pullman Road. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2458.94s)]
*  This was the traffic stop of Mr. Koberger's car, which turned out to be a 2015 white Hyundai [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2462.14s)]
*  Elantra with Pennsylvania plates. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2469.22s)]
*  During the course of the traffic stop, Deputy Duke was able to obtain Mr. Koberger's name, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2472.22s)]
*  Ryan Koberger, his phone number and his address, which at that point was an apartment address [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2478.7s)]
*  in Pullman. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2483.7s)]
*  We then move to the early morning hours of November 13th, 2022. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2486.42s)]
*  The state's evidence would show that early morning hours on that day, Mr. Koberger's [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2494.1400000000003s)]

*  northwest part of Pullman. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2504.42s)]
*  That phone was then subsequently turned off at approximately 2.54 a.m. and remained off [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2507.42s)]
*  until approximately 4.48 a.m. on Sunday, the 13th of November. [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2514.9s)]
*  The state's evidence would include a trial, a video surveillance of a business on the [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2521.5s)]
*  Moscow-Pullman Highway just across the state line from Moscow. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2528.5s)]
*  It would show a vehicle matching the description of the defendant's Hyundai Elantra entering [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2533.2200000000003s)]
*  Moscow at approximately 3.02 a.m. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2538.42s)]
*  The compiled surveillance that the investigators put together from businesses and residents [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2543.2999999999997s)]
*  then show the defendant's car, the white Elantra, as I've described, circling the 1122 King [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2548.54s)]
*  Road area, that neighborhood, starting around 3.30 or so in the morning, comes into the [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2556.1s)]
*  immediate area of 1122 King Road, which is actually on a dead end, and then leaves several [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2563.66s)]
*  times, and approximately 4.05, that morning, the defendant's car had entered that area, [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2570.2599999999998s)]
*  was leaving, stopped at the intersection of King and Queen Road, did a U-turn, and the [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2576.8999999999996s)]
*  state's evidence would show that the defendant's car came back and parked behind and above [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2583.2599999999998s)]
*  the 1122 King Road residence. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2589.8199999999997s)]
*  The state believes that its evidence would then show that the defendant entered the residence [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2594.46s)]
*  of 1122 through the kitchen sliding door on the back side of the residence, which is the [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2601.54s)]
*  side of the residence that would face the area above where the defendant's car was parked. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2606.2200000000003s)]
*  The defendant entered the residence, went to the third floor, and with a knife killed [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2612.7400000000002s)]
*  Madison Mogan and Caitlin Gitzalz. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2620.1s)]
*  The defendant, as he left that room, for whatever reason, ended up leaving, or the sheath for [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2624.86s)]
*  a K-bar knife was left on the bed next to Madison Mogan's body. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2632.58s)]
*  And I can jump ahead, that sheath was tested by the Idaho State Police Forensic Lab, and [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2638.06s)]
*  single source male DNA was found on the snap of that sheath, as well as blood from both [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2643.7s)]
*  Caitlin and Madison and other trace evidence. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2651.18s)]
*  But it's important to note, single source male DNA was on the snap of that sheath. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2653.46s)]
*  The state's evidence would show that Zana Knodel was still awake at this time. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2660.74s)]
*  In fact, had taken a door-dash order not long before this started. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2665.3799999999997s)]
*  Her room was not on the third floor, it was on the second floor on the west side. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2669.46s)]
*  As the defendant was either coming down the stairs or leaving, he encountered Zana and [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2676.04s)]
*  he ended up killing her, also with a large knife. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2682.92s)]
*  Ethan Chapin, Zana's boyfriend, was asleep in their bedroom, in her bedroom, and the [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2687.92s)]
*  defendant killed him as well, with a large fixed-blade knife. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2693.72s)]
*  Each victim suffered multiple wounds. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2698.16s)]
*  I will state for the record that there is no evidence there was any sexual component [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2700.56s)]
*  or sexual assault on any of the victims. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2704.32s)]
*  I want to make that clear so there's no speculation. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2706.52s)]
*  There were two other roommates in the house, and they were already asleep. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2710.84s)]
*  During the course of this, one of those roommates awoke, looked out her door not knowing what [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2715.48s)]
*  was going on, and saw the defendant who was dressed in black, with a black velvet coat [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2720.96s)]
*  on, holding some sort of container in his hand. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2726.28s)]
*  And she saw him leave the house through the direction of the kitchen where that sliding [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2730.04s)]
*  door is that I mentioned before. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2735.16s)]
*  At approximately 420 that morning, so this would have been 15 minutes or so later, the [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2739.16s)]
*  defendant's car is seen on a surveillance camera for 1112 King Road, which is immediately [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2749.32s)]
*  next door to the west of 1122, leaving the area at a high rate of speed. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2755.8s)]
*  And if the court were to see that, or anybody in this courtroom would see that, you can [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2762.2000000000003s)]
*  see the car almost loses control as it makes the coroner heads north and then turns to [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2765.52s)]
*  go south on Wilenta, which is one of the only ways to get out of that part of town. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2772.44s)]
*  The evidence would show that following that, the defendant in his Elantra drove south of [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2779.92s)]
*  Moscow. [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2786.36s)]
*  We know that he drove on the back roads because there are surveillance cameras on the main [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2787.44s)]
*  highways, Highway 95. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2791.7200000000003s)]
*  It would have picked up the defendant's car if he'd gone that route, and they did not [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2793.92s)]
*  show the defendant's car on that route during the time. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2797.28s)]
*  So we know that he went through a variety of back roads in a very rural, isolated part [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2799.92s)]
*  of Laetaw County. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2804.6s)]
*  About 448 that morning, the defendant's phone comes back on. [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2806.8s)]
*  And the evidence will show that that phone was located south of Moscow, likely at a side [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2813.84s)]
*  road intersection with Highway 95. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2820.5800000000004s)]
*  From there, the defendant's phone activity tracks heading back north towards Pullman, [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2824.36s)]
*  Washington, where the defendant lived. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2829.32s)]
*  About 526, starting approximately 526, various surveillance cameras in Pullman, Washington [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2833.16s)]
*  pick up the defendant's vehicle as he enters Pullman from the south and heads north and [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2839.52s)]
*  slightly west towards his apartment where he arrived at approximately 530 in the morning. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2845.8399999999997s)]
*  Later that morning, still this Sunday, the 13th of November of 2022, Mr. Coburg's phone [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2853.92s)]
*  returned to the area of King Road. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2861.68s)]
*  We don't know exactly what he did, but it returned to that area. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2864.16s)]
*  It's about nine o'clock in the morning. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2866.7999999999997s)]
*  It was there for about 10 minutes and then returned to his Pullman residence. [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2869.2799999999997s)]
*  About 930, the state's evidence will show, evidence taken from the defendant's phone, [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2875.2599999999998s)]
*  that he took a selfie of himself on his phone in what appears to be the bathroom of his [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2881.4s)]
*  Pullman apartment with a thumbs up. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2886.92s)]
*  The defendant's phone then went to the Lewiston-Quarston Valley, approximately 30 miles south of Moscow [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2891.76s)]
*  and Pullman, and the defendant is actually seen with his car at various businesses down [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2898.4s)]
*  there. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2903.44s)]
*  This area is the confluence of the Clearwater River and the Snake River. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2904.44s)]
*  Lewiston is Idaho's seaport, large bodies of moving water down there. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2909.44s)]
*  In addition to tracing the defendant's activities, as I've just outlined on the 13th and leading [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2916.64s)]
*  up to the 13th, the state's evidence will show that following Sunday, November 13th, [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2921.7999999999997s)]
*  2022, business records show that the defendant began searching for a K-bar knife and a K-bar [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2928.6s)]
*  knife sheath, as the state believes, to replace the one that was left at the scene of the [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2936.04s)]
*  murders. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2943.04s)]
*  The evidence also will suggest that there were at least attempts by the defendant to [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2944.84s)]
*  delete or alter his purchase history on Amazon, where all these transactions had occurred. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2950.28s)]
*  Later that week, the state's evidence will show that Mr. Koberger went to what we would [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2956.84s)]
*  call DMV, motor vehicle licensing here in Idaho, in Pullman to change his car registration [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2961.6800000000003s)]
*  from Pennsylvania to Washington. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2968.7200000000003s)]
*  That's of note because Pennsylvania cars do not require a front license plate. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2972.72s)]
*  The vehicle seen on the surveillance cameras of the defendant's car showed it didn't have [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2978.2s)]
*  a front license plate on it. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2982.88s)]
*  At the time of the traffic stop by Deputy Duke in August, there was a Pennsylvania plate [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2984.64s)]
*  and a front license plate. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2989.84s)]
*  Mr. Koberger proceeded to finish his semester of studies at Washington State University [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=2994.72s)]
*  and returned to Pennsylvania for the holidays. [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3000.58s)]
*  Law enforcement at this point were aware of Mr. Koberger, had been accessing information [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3004.54s)]
*  about him, were trying to find him. [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3009.58s)]
*  They located him in Pennsylvania and they conducted what's called a trash pull. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3011.46s)]
*  During the nighttime hours, agents of the FBI, who assisted immensely with this case, [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3017.36s)]
*  working with the sanitation department back in this neighborhood in Pennsylvania, took [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3025.62s)]
*  trash that had been set out on the street for collection, sent the contents of that [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3030.14s)]
*  from the Pennsylvania residents of the defendant's parents to the Idaho State Friends Laboratory, [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3036.26s)]
*  where the lab experts there were able to identify DNA on a Q-tip as coming from the father of [[00:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3044.14s)]
*  the person whose DNA was found on the knife sheath that was next to Madison Logan's body [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3052.98s)]
*  in the bed. [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3059.66s)]
*  Subsequently, an arrest warrant was issued here in Idaho and a search warrant was issued [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3061.66s)]
*  in the state of Pennsylvania with the assistance not only of the FBI but the Pennsylvania State [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3067.66s)]
*  Police. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3072.18s)]
*  Mr. Koberger was arrested at his parents' home to return to Idaho. [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3073.18s)]
*  Upon his return to Idaho, a DNA sample was taken from him and it matched the DNA found [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3077.78s)]
*  on the knife sheath next to Maddie's body at the crime scene. [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3084.86s)]
*  I can tell the court and the public the weapon itself, the knife, has not yet been recovered. [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3090.5s)]
*  I can tell the court that the defendant's apartment in Pullman was searched as well [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3097.5400000000004s)]
*  as his office. [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3102.42s)]
*  Spartan would be a kind characterization. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3103.9s)]
*  There was virtually nothing there. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3106.34s)]
*  Nothing of evidentiary value was found. [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3108.26s)]
*  And of course, we are now talking six, eight weeks after the time of the killings. [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3111.1400000000003s)]
*  In Pennsylvania, the defendant's car was seized and it was actually pretty much disassembled [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3116.46s)]
*  internally. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3120.46s)]
*  And it also had been cleaned. [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3121.78s)]
*  There was a bucket of cleaner right beside it. [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3123.78s)]
*  I think we can all look to our own cars, you know, in those compartments in the doors. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3128.26s)]
*  You can try to keep them clean where you put stuff. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3132.46s)]
*  There's always some degree of crud in there. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3134.98s)]
*  They were spotless. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3137.3s)]
*  The defense car had been meticulously cleaned inside. [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3138.3s)]
*  And the state would present to the jury that that was part of the defendant's plan in covering [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3142.54s)]
*  up this. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3149.7400000000002s)]
*  The defendant has studied crime. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3150.7400000000002s)]
*  In fact, he did a detailed paper on crime scene processing when he was working on his [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3152.14s)]
*  pre-doctorate degrees. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3158.34s)]
*  And he had that knowledge and skill. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3160.46s)]
*  So Your Honor, at the end, the state submits the evidence that I've given just a quick [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3162.7000000000003s)]
*  overview of and that presenting court would consume weeks, which the state is prepared [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3167.3s)]
*  to do and has been prepared to do, would show that as the defendant has just admitted and [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3172.94s)]
*  pleaded guilty on November 13, 2022. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3178.02s)]
*  Excuse me. [[00:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3181.7400000000002s)]
*  Ms. Koberger entered the residence of 1122 King Road in Moscow, Idaho. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3183.74s)]
*  He did that with the intent to kill. [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3192.22s)]
*  We will not represent that he intended to commit all of the murders that he did that [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3194.2599999999998s)]
*  night, but we know that that is what resulted and that he then killed intentionally, willfully, [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3199.2599999999998s)]
*  and deliberately with premeditation and with malice forethought. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3207.5s)]
*  Manny Mogin, Kayleigh Consolmus, Ethan Chapin, and Santa Cruz. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3212.26s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3219.82s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3220.86s)]
*  All right. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3221.86s)]
*  Based on the state's proffer and, importantly, based upon defendant's explicit admission [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3231.06s)]
*  to committing these crimes, the court finds there is a factual basis. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3238.1s)]
*  Therefore, with respect to Count 1 burglary felony, how do you plead, Mr. Koberger, guilty [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3242.3s)]
*  or not guilty? [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3247.54s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3248.54s)]
*  As to Count 2, murder in the first degree as it relates to the murder of Madison Mogin, [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3250.22s)]
*  how do you plead, guilty or not guilty? [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3257.02s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3259.06s)]
*  As to Count 3, as it relates to murder in the first degree for the murder of Kayleigh [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3260.06s)]
*  Consolmus, how do you plead, guilty or not guilty? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3263.7799999999997s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3266.38s)]
*  As to Count 4, the first degree murder of Zana Cronodal, a human being, how do you plead, [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3267.38s)]
*  guilty or not guilty? [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3275.1s)]
*  Guilty. [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3276.1s)]
*  The court will find that the defendant understands the nature of the charges and each offense [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3277.66s)]
*  and the possible consequences to him of his guilty plea. [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3283.86s)]
*  The court finds that there is a factual basis for the plea and finds the defendant believes [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3287.2599999999998s)]
*  the plea to be in his best interest. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3291.22s)]
*  I find that the plea was given freely, voluntarily, and was not committed by the defendant. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3293.1s)]
*  I also find that the defendant is not guilty of the charges. [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3298.5s)]
*  I find that the defendant believes the plea to be in his best interest. [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3302.02s)]
*  I find that the plea was given freely, voluntarily, and was intelligently made. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3304.02s)]
*  I accept the plea. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3308.02s)]
*  I direct that it be entered. [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3309.02s)]
*  I'll continue the matter for sentencing in this case. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3310.66s)]
*  I think it was mentioned on the call Monday afternoon the defense wishes to waive a pretrial [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3314.66s)]
*  investigation. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3320.02s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3321.02s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3322.02s)]
*  State also? [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3323.02s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3324.02s)]
*  The state does not believe a pre-sentence investigation is needed given the evidence [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3325.02s)]
*  that is available. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3330.98s)]
*  We want to, though, make sure that all of the victims have the opportunity to make statements [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3332.54s)]
*  to the court at sentencing. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3336.9s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3338.94s)]
*  And certainly both the state and the defense may present whatever sentencing memorandum [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3339.94s)]
*  and other documents you wish me to consider. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3348.42s)]
*  The victims will be given an opportunity to provide the statements that they wish to at [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3352.3s)]
*  sentencing. [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3358.54s)]
*  Do we need more than one full day for sentencing? [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3359.58s)]
*  I do not believe so, Your Honor. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3363.2599999999998s)]
*  Obviously we have numerous victims and we have victims who share unique, excuse me, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3365.7799999999997s)]
*  who share unique perspectives on this and we want to make sure that they all have time [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3372.14s)]
*  to express their feelings to the court. [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3376.54s)]
*  But I believe that if we can start perhaps 8.30 or so in the morning that we should be [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3378.54s)]
*  able to complete it all in one day. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3382.9s)]
*  Do you and the defense agree with that in terms of the time frame? [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3386.82s)]
*  Yes, Your Honor. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3389.7000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3390.7000000000003s)]
*  So as it happens, we have some time reserved in this case in July and August. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3393.7000000000003s)]
*  The week of July 22nd is available. [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3402.26s)]
*  I don't know if that's too soon for the parties or the next week, the week of August 4 is [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3404.78s)]
*  available. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3411.02s)]
*  Any preference? [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3413.1000000000004s)]
*  Your Honor, we're prepared as soon as the court wants to schedule it. [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3415.42s)]
*  This date I believe would be prepared on the 22nd. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3418.94s)]
*  We've told the victims' families that we're looking at approximately those dates. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3421.2200000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3424.86s)]
*  So because of the plan to bring in so many jurors to fill out questionnaires, I had ordered [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3425.86s)]
*  that no other trials could take place in this courthouse the week of July 22nd. [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3434.46s)]
*  And so we will use that in terms of the sentencing date because of what I'm sure will be the [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3440.62s)]
*  significant interest of the media and the public and the logistics that will be required [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3446.58s)]
*  to make that happen. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3455.62s)]
*  Without trials going, it'll be a lot easier to do that. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3459.06s)]
*  So let's pick that week. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3461.22s)]
*  Why don't we pick July 23rd with the idea that if for some reason we don't finish, [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3462.5s)]
*  we could continue into the 24th. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3469.22s)]
*  We'll start at 9 in the morning. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3472.3399999999997s)]
*  Does that give your team enough time, Sandra, 9 in the morning? [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3477.02s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3480.1s)]
*  Any concerns with that date? [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3482.62s)]
*  No, Your Honor, thank you. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3483.62s)]
*  No, sir. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3485.62s)]
*  All right. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3486.62s)]
*  Any reason why I should not rescind the non-dissemination order at this time? [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3491.8599999999997s)]
*  I think that given the history of this case, it would be best if that remained in place [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3498.26s)]
*  through sentencing. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3502.2200000000003s)]
*  So we have time to make sure there's the ability to completely answer questions. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3503.4s)]
*  That would be the state's preference and recommendation. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3511.1400000000003s)]
*  We'd have no objection for the order to remain in place through sentencing. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3515.94s)]
*  I will, at this point, the idea to keep it until sentencing, which time it would be withdrawn [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3518.78s)]
*  in order to give the parties the space and time to prepare to meet what I'm sure will [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3532.98s)]
*  be the deluge of media requests. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3538.38s)]
*  That's at least my preliminary decision at this point. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3543.3s)]
*  We can always revisit if it seems to be, for some reason, I should, that said. [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3546.46s)]
*  Obviously, I don't think the defendant, a bond was ever set for the defendant, where [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3555.9s)]
*  it would be revoked. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3563.02s)]
*  The prior order allowing him to come in civilian clothes is revoked, given his plea and no [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3564.62s)]
*  longer the presumption of innocence, and in fact, now the actual conviction for the crimes. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3569.94s)]
*  He will continue to be held at the jail pending sentencing. [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3575.82s)]
*  Is there anything else today? [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3579.34s)]
*  No, Your Honor. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3581.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3582.86s)]
*  I assume that the trial date will be vacated and the four jurors will be released. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3583.86s)]
*  The trial will be vacated and I'm sure that the jury commissioner will get word to those [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3589.06s)]
*  that receive their summons that they won't be required to attend. [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3597.82s)]
*  So that said, again, if you would all please wait for the parties and the victims, families [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3600.94s)]
*  and others to leave the courtroom before you do, I would appreciate it. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3608.94s)]
*  And with that, we're adjourned. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3613.26s)]
*  All right, please. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3617.46s)]
*  Extraordinary day. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3621.62s)]
*  Three years ago, Brian Kohlberger left the Poconos for Washington State, where he had [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3623.5s)]
*  everything in front of him. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3629.1s)]
*  He had gotten into a prestigious PhD program to study criminal justice. [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3631.38s)]
*  He could have had a life in law enforcement enforcing the law against bad guys, and instead [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3636.8399999999997s)]
*  he chose to become one of them. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3641.14s)]
*  And now three years later, four innocent lives have been stolen by him as he ruined a fifth, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3643.72s)]
*  his own, along the way. [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3650.7s)]
*  Extraordinary to watch him stand up and say, guilty. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3653.16s)]
*  I did it. [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3656.3399999999997s)]
*  The actual guilty was said while seated, but we saw him stand at the beginning and over [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3658.38s)]
*  and over again, just chilling. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3662.3s)]
*  Did you murder Madison Mogan, a human being? [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3665.48s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3669.38s)]
*  Did you murder Kaylee Goncalves? [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3670.56s)]
*  Yes. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3672.86s)]
*  And when they were doing the yes part of it, before they got to the guilty, guilty, guilty, [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3673.86s)]
*  guilty, when they were doing the yes, it was almost kind of snippy the way the way they [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3677.94s)]
*  were going through it. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3683.78s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3684.78s)]
*  Let me just replay it and our panel will come back in. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3685.78s)]
*  Watch. [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3686.78s)]
*  Did you on November 13th, 2022, enter the residence at 1122 King Road in Moscow, Idaho, [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3687.86s)]

*  Like a student taking an oral exam and he's got all the answers and he can comfort himself [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3780.18s)]
*  at having them for the rest of his life as he rots in prison, which is a fate too good [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3784.5s)]
*  for Brian Kohlberger. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3789.56s)]

*  Wow. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3793.5s)]
*  Matt, I'll start with you on it. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3794.5s)]
*  It's not your first rodeo seeing something like that. [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3795.98s)]
*  What did you make of what we just witnessed? [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3798.22s)]
*  I'm kind of frustrated, actually. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3802.74s)]
*  I sat on our death penalty special circumstance committee for 15 years in Orange County. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3806.7s)]
*  And essentially what you do in a special circumstance murder like this, it's special circumstances [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3812.5s)]
*  murder, is you go through the law piece by piece and you weigh the aggravating versus [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3817.02s)]
*  mitigating circumstances. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3823.46s)]
*  And you go through those very carefully. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3825.62s)]
*  What are the factors in aggravation? [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3827.18s)]
*  What are the factors in mitigation? [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3829.14s)]
*  And from that, we would make a recommendation to the elected DA, who then makes a very somber [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3830.7799999999997s)]
*  decision whether or not to seek the death penalty or life without possibility of parole. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3835.52s)]
*  We only sought death in less over the course of those 15 years, less than 4% of the cases, [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3840.58s)]
*  Megan. [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3846.5s)]
*  This case screams out for the death penalty. [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3847.5s)]
*  So my big question here is what changed? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3849.34s)]
*  Because it's unethical to file a death enhancement or to seek the death penalty with the idea [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3853.5s)]
*  that you are extracting a plea. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3858.46s)]
*  And I'm not saying this prosecutor did that. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3859.98s)]
*  But when you hear the evidence from me listening to the fact that he got a K-bar on Amazon [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3862.42s)]
*  before we moved out, I think that's a new fact. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3868.98s)]
*  I knew about the phones. [[01:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3871.46s)]
*  I knew about the rest of it. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3872.7400000000002s)]
*  This is an overwhelming case. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3874.1000000000004s)]
*  So again, what changed other than him deciding, other than Kovriger asking to plead guilty, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3876.18s)]
*  that changed the assessment that this was a death penalty case? [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3881.3799999999997s)]
*  And it is at the end, and I don't like to... [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3885.5s)]
*  Being a prosecutor is a tough job. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3890.02s)]
*  I acknowledge that. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3891.74s)]
*  I did it for 26 years. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3892.74s)]
*  So I'm reluctant to criticize, you know, because it is a tough position. [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3893.9199999999996s)]
*  But if he choked up at the end, I think that we listened to the DA choke up at the end. [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3900.8599999999997s)]
*  As you talked about that, it's like, dude, you gave this guy a break. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3906.3s)]
*  And we didn't hear one single thing that changed in your assessment between the aggravating [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3910.34s)]
*  and the mitigating factors. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3914.82s)]
*  We didn't hear anything. [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3915.82s)]
*  We didn't hear anything about a new story of abuse, some piece of evidence that wasn't [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3916.82s)]
*  going to be admitted. [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3920.78s)]
*  Nothing changed. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3922.02s)]
*  And one of those families is irate. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3923.2400000000002s)]
*  And you don't... [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3926.94s)]
*  It's like the old saying, there's no crying in baseball. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3928.78s)]
*  There's no crying when you're in the prosecution business and you're talking about the slaughter [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3931.22s)]
*  of four innocent kids when you're giving the defendant a break. [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3937.22s)]
*  The big winner today, I hate to say it, is Brian Coburger. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3940.48s)]
*  And I am... [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3943.7799999999997s)]
*  I'm just... [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3945.62s)]
*  I was frustrated listening to that. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3946.62s)]
*  And I got no problem calling him out. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3948.4599999999996s)]
*  Unless there was something that changed behind the scenes that we didn't hear about today, [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3951.06s)]
*  I think that they should have proceeded with the death penalty. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3955.02s)]
*  Well said. [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3959.2999999999997s)]
*  Nothing changed, Howard. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3960.38s)]
*  Nothing changed other than Brian Coburger's willingness to take the plea. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3961.38s)]
*  It is such a cynical decision on the part of the state to make this plea bargain. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3964.98s)]
*  And during the course of the recitation by Thompson, he kept on saying things, so many [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3971.9s)]
*  things we don't know. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3978.5800000000004s)]
*  He said, for whatever reason, we don't know exactly why he did this. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3979.5800000000004s)]
*  The state, the evidence suggests these are answers that we will never get, that the families, [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3983.94s)]
*  more importantly, will never get. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3989.7799999999997s)]
*  I think they need to know this. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3991.2599999999998s)]
*  It was a very dramatic moment and ultimately very disappointing moment. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3994.74s)]
*  Even the state's decision to keep the gag order in place, they're trying to keep this [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=3999.46s)]
*  quiet for as long as they can to get this over with and then move on. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4004.2599999999998s)]
*  Move on. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4009.18s)]
*  That's been the... [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4010.18s)]
*  You know, from the beginning of this case, they were in a rush to tear down the house [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4011.18s)]
*  where the murders occurred. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4015.3s)]
*  The judge himself who took this case, Hippler, said, I'm not happy to be here. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4016.94s)]
*  I wish I could say I was, but I'm not. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4021.18s)]
*  Judge Judge quickly got off of it. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4023.46s)]
*  The original judge, the chief of police, retired as soon as he could. [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4025.58s)]
*  This is not a political cover-up, but it's sort of a benign neglect. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4031.38s)]
*  Let's move on, let Idaho forget this. [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4035.86s)]
*  But the reality is the state, the town, the surviving families, they will never forget [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4038.66s)]
*  this. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4044.02s)]
*  They may have done a real injustice by the state. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4045.02s)]
*  Totally agree. [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4048.5s)]
*  They deserved the trial that they were promised, that they were entitled to. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4049.5s)]
*  They deserve to see the witnesses take the stand and have the actual evidence, the overwhelming [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4054.74s)]
*  evidence presented against him so that there'd be zero doubt in anybody's mind. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4059.9s)]
*  We deserved it. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4064.78s)]
*  We deserve to see him sentenced to death. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4065.78s)]
*  If the death penalty is not appropriate for Brian Kohlberger, who is it appropriate for? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4067.18s)]
*  Innocence, three of whom were asleep in their beds with zero chance of even fighting back. [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4074.1s)]
*  He murdered them at the prime of their life with it all in front of them. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4081.78s)]
*  Who's the death penalty for? [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4085.46s)]
*  Idaho has the death penalty. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4087.26s)]
*  They believe in the death penalty because of that prosecutor who wants us to feel that [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4088.26s)]
*  he does empathize with the victim's family with that choking up at the very end part. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4092.94s)]
*  It was in his hands, Matt. [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4097.860000000001s)]
*  He could have said no. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4099.42s)]
*  The only thing that changed, and I've been reading nonstop about it since we found out [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4100.58s)]
*  that there was a deal, the only thing that changed was the circumstances on the defense [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4103.7s)]
*  side. [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4107.42s)]
*  None of the proof. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4108.42s)]
*  Ann Taylor's attempt to get the death penalty off the table failed. [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4109.42s)]
*  Ann Taylor's attempt, Howard and I have been talking about this for two years now, to get [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4113.54s)]
*  the DNA evidence thrown out because there was some, like, T's weren't perfectly crossed [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4117.78s)]
*  and I's weren't perfectly dotted in finding that hit in the DNA database. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4122.06s)]
*  Her challenge to that failed. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4126.66s)]
*  Ann Taylor's attempt at the last minute to bring in four other names as possible suspects [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4128.66s)]
*  failed when the judge said there's zero evidence those people did it and in fact DNA and finger [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4132.58s)]
*  print tests have been done on them and they have nothing to do with this case. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4137.099999999999s)]
*  Only when Ann Taylor realized she didn't have a shot at disproving anything, at really poking [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4140.66s)]
*  holes in the prosecution's case, did she go to them on Friday and say, make us an offer. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4146.54s)]
*  And he did. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4151.54s)]
*  What you're saying is a prosecutor who knows he has a good case would, nine times out of [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4152.54s)]
*  ten, and has the right to say, I will not make you a deal. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4158.94s)]
*  The deal is he can plead guilty and be subjected to the death penalty. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4163.22s)]
*  Yeah, not nine times out of ten, Megan. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4166.9s)]
*  That's the only thing I've heard between you and Howard that he disagreed with. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4169.94s)]
*  It's nine hundred and ninety-one times out of a thousand on a death case. [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4172.94s)]
*  The decision was already made. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4176.7s)]
*  So why did we just go through all this? [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4178.78s)]
*  I'll tell you another thing I take issue with. [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4180.58s)]
*  What's with the acknowledgement of there are many other houses in the area. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4182.7s)]
*  The guy's pleading guilty. [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4186.62s)]
*  We know he was there to go. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4187.9s)]
*  I know. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4189.38s)]
*  To check out Kings Road. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4190.38s)]
*  It's clear why he's doing that. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4191.38s)]
*  He's trying to imply, well, maybe I couldn't have won this case. [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4194.46s)]
*  Don't attack me because maybe my case wasn't that solid. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4198.22s)]
*  He is going overboard to impugn his own case publicly so he won't be criticized. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4200.78s)]
*  Well let me tell you another thing. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4206.74s)]
*  Yeah, and another thing. [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4208.54s)]
*  And I look when he says there was no component, I wrote this down, no sexual component or [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4209.54s)]
*  sexual assault. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4215.94s)]
*  He doesn't know that. [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4217.3s)]
*  How do we know what Brian Koberger's intent was, which is exactly you're just talking [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4218.74s)]
*  about, Megan. [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4222.86s)]
*  What do we why did he enter that house? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4223.86s)]
*  And he was obsessed with Ted Bundy. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4226.1s)]
*  We know about that from some of the information. [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4227.66s)]
*  Actually, I think I read about that from something that that Howard wrote. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4229.62s)]
*  We know that he was obsessed with Ted Bundy. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4232.86s)]
*  Ted Bundy sexually abused every single one of his victims. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4234.66s)]
*  So like Mike Tyson says, everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4237.9s)]
*  Right. [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4241.74s)]
*  The great philosopher Mike Tyson. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4242.74s)]
*  We don't know what Brian Koberger was thinking, but I can tell you this. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4243.74s)]
*  The vast majority of serial killers and I prosecuted 13 of these guys. [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4247.299999999999s)]
*  I'm about to write a second book on serial killers. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4252.46s)]
*  The vast majority of them back in the 1880s, they were dubbed sadistic lust murderers. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4255.7s)]
*  That's what they used to say. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4261.7s)]
*  He doesn't know this guy with his beard. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4262.9s)]
*  Sorry, does not know what Brian Koberger was thinking when he went in there and he cannot [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4265.299999999999s)]
*  say there was not a sexual component to it. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4271.0199999999995s)]
*  And I'll tell you what, on behalf of sexual abuse victims everywhere, these victims can't [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4273.299999999999s)]
*  speak for themselves. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4278.379999999999s)]
*  That was a slap in the face to people that have survived horrific things like this. [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4279.96s)]
*  He doesn't know. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4284.099999999999s)]
*  So he maybe he meant to say there was no actual sexual assault, which is fine. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4285.36s)]
*  He spoke to his intent and that I think was inappropriate. [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4290.78s)]
*  Also, it's incorrect. [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4293.46s)]
*  I mean, you cannot go into a house, target a young woman and without having a sexual [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4295.5s)]
*  element in some way being part of the motivation. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4302.86s)]
*  And the thing is, we'll never know his real motivation. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4306.139999999999s)]
*  All these things that the Thompson said he admitted for whatever reason, evidence suggests [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4308.94s)]
*  we'll never get those answers. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4315.599999999999s)]
*  Also interesting, this is a major victory really for Ann Taylor. [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4317.56s)]
*  She accomplished what she could with the cards she was dealt. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4321.120000000001s)]
*  She kept her client from going before a firing squad. [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4324.280000000001s)]
*  And yet, the only time there was, I thought, a moment of perhaps a disagreement when the [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4328.96s)]
*  judge asked her, did you get all the discovery you needed? [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4334.120000000001s)]
*  And that's been a key part for her. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4337.68s)]
*  She's been protesting that time after time. [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4340.280000000001s)]
*  She filed two separate motions about not getting the discovery she needed. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4342.68s)]
*  And yet, here she paused, you know, pregnantly and then she conceded yes, just to appease [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4346.88s)]
*  the judge, I think. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4352.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4353.16s)]
*  Can I add something else, Megan? [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4354.16s)]
*  Just having done so many of these, when you listen to that judge, that's a no-nonsense [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4356.92s)]
*  judge. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4364.92s)]
*  I know Howard's got some criticism for him as a practicing lawyer. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4365.92s)]
*  I can't offer any from what I just saw. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4369.24s)]
*  But look, that judge would have taken care of business. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4371.4400000000005s)]
*  He would have made the right rulings. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4374.96s)]
*  He was sober as a trial lawyer. [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4376.04s)]
*  That's the type of person that when you got the evidence, when you have a judicial officer [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4380.08s)]
*  like that who is smart and on the ball, like I think this judge very much is, that's the [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4384.32s)]
*  courtroom where you win your cases. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4391.36s)]
*  So again, what has changed? [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4393.4s)]
*  I mean, you've got a solid judge. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4395.08s)]
*  You have overwhelming evidence. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4397.0s)]
*  I've heard nothing whatsoever in mitigation offered at any point by the defense. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4399.6s)]
*  This is a really good death penalty case. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4406.0s)]
*  And they all get appealed. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4409.44s)]
*  And you're going to face the highest level of appellate scrutiny through the Ninth Circuit [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4411.4s)]
*  as death penalty cases should. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4416.639999999999s)]
*  But again, the decision was made. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4418.959999999999s)]
*  The family's geared up for it. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4421.0s)]
*  I want to know what changed other than him coming to the table and wanting to take a [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4422.959999999999s)]
*  deal, which they always do. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4426.5599999999995s)]
*  Let me just add this other piece of it, because you mentioned that did he have sexual motive [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4428.5599999999995s)]
*  in mind? [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4433.599999999999s)]
*  Did he have any sexual element to this? [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4434.72s)]
*  To back up what you said, you remember this came out in that Dateline special that happened [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4437.6s)]
*  like a month ago that led Ann Taylor to say we need a delay of the trial date. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4442.88s)]
*  This thing is so damning to us. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4446.160000000001s)]
*  And clearly somebody on team prosecution or cop participated or so it would seem, because [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4447.76s)]
*  a lot of the evidence we heard the prosecutor talking about there, we learned from that [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4453.04s)]
*  Dateline special. [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4455.92s)]
*  And one of the things was that in November 2022 after, I believe it was after the murders, [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4456.92s)]
*  Brian Kohlberger searched the Internet for information about Ted Bundy and made a number [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4463.72s)]
*  of searches for pornography with the keywords drugged, sleeping and passed out. [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4468.080000000001s)]
*  Now you tell me why he insisted on going in there at four in the morning when three out [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4474.84s)]
*  of his four victims had been asleep, were asleep. [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4480.72s)]
*  Ethan was asleep. [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4484.120000000001s)]
*  Xana was up and she got chased. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4485.120000000001s)]
*  But Maddie and Kaylee were asleep in their beds and he's searching for porn relating [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4487.8s)]
*  to sleeping victims, Matt. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4493.96s)]
*  And this prosecutor can say there was no sexual, he doesn't know what Brian Kohlberger did. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4496.320000000001s)]
*  He doesn't know whether he got off as he's murdering those two girls or what element [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4501.08s)]
*  it brought up for him. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4505.64s)]
*  Like how dare he say that? [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4507.16s)]
*  That's right. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4510.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4511.0s)]
*  Totally inappropriate for him to do that. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4512.0s)]
*  I don't know if he misspoke and just meant to say sexual assault because of course that [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4513.599999999999s)]
*  doesn't appear to have happened. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4518.44s)]
*  But for him to say there's no sexual component, that offends me. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4521.2s)]
*  I don't think he misspoke. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4524.799999999999s)]
*  I think he said it deliberately because he wants to put his plea deal in the best light. [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4526.44s)]
*  I also think it's interesting to look at Ann Taylor and her team. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4531.16s)]
*  She filed many motions saying that Kohlberger, because of where he was on the autistic spectrum, [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4536.08s)]
*  wasn't able to understand things. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4542.04s)]
*  He couldn't cooperate with his lawyers. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4544.04s)]
*  He couldn't understand what was happening in the courtroom. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4546.4s)]
*  He couldn't actually even make a plea. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4549.48s)]
*  Now all of a sudden she is allowing him to make this plea. [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4551.6s)]
*  He's saying under oath that he understands everything. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4555.8s)]
*  And I know lawyers have a responsibility to defend their clients, whoever they are, to [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4559.76s)]
*  the best of their abilities. [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4565.48s)]
*  But things were said in defense of Kohlberger by Ann and her team, Ms. Masuth. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4567.48s)]
*  Ms. Masuth put her arm around Kohlberger and said it is an honor, an honor to defend him. [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4574.04s)]
*  These things I think need to be answered. [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4581.719999999999s)]
*  Here it is, here it is. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4583.719999999999s)]
*  Just to reiterate, this is the full quote from the prosecutor. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4590.28s)]
*  I will say for the record that there is no evidence there was any sexual component or [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4593.8s)]
*  sexual assault on any of the victims. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4598.88s)]
*  I want to make that clear so there's no speculation. [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4601.56s)]
*  There it is, clear as day. [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4605.320000000001s)]
*  There is no sexual, there was no sexual component. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4607.68s)]
*  He is out of line. [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4612.84s)]
*  How can he possibly know in light of those searches, which by the way he didn't mention. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4613.84s)]
*  He also didn't mention those searches when going back over his evidence. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4619.320000000001s)]
*  I'm sure that was no accident, Matt. [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4623.0s)]
*  Which are 100% admissible, Megan. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4625.48s)]
*  They would be admissible in court for motive even if it's an uncharged act. [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4627.76s)]
*  That's coming in. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4634.6s)]
*  Any judge is letting that in. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4635.6s)]
*  I guarantee that particular judge would let that into evidence. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4636.6s)]
*  So yeah, that's I think maybe. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4638.92s)]
*  Can I say one other thing about the judge? [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4640.92s)]
*  Let me just say one other thing about the judge. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4643.32s)]
*  I see your point. [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4644.76s)]
*  I take your point was winnable because the judge is no nonsense. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4645.76s)]
*  But I will say shame on that judge for not understanding how to pronounce Xana Cronodal's [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4647.84s)]
*  name by this point in the proceedings. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4652.56s)]
*  It was disrespectful. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4654.64s)]
*  And I can understand once you're nervous, the cameras are on, but it happened repeatedly. [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4655.88s)]
*  And I'm sure it had like the shock effect on anyone who knew Xana, including her family. [[01:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4660.8s)]
*  Like I'm sorry, but study the names before you walk in there as the judge. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4666.52s)]
*  I thought it was disrespectful. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4670.84s)]
*  And Howard, I also thought it was disrespectful for him to open it up by chastising Steve [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4671.84s)]
*  Gonzalez, which is really what he did with his whole someone is telling people to call [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4678.24s)]
*  the court. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4683.599999999999s)]
*  That was Steve in a desperate father whose daughter is murdered, said, please, maybe [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4684.599999999999s)]
*  if we call the courthouse, we can stop this from getting approved. [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4690.639999999999s)]
*  And instead of being like, you know, gentle about it, please don't call the court because [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4694.88s)]
*  it's not going to change anything with respect to the families. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4699.719999999999s)]
*  We understand this is agonizing. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4702.44s)]
*  He was angry and his ire was toward the dad of one of the four victims. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4704.32s)]
*  I mean, Steve is a tragic figure in this whole case. [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4709.92s)]
*  Early on, he made a statement. [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4714.28s)]
*  I was there. [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4716.5599999999995s)]
*  He said, you send your daughter off to college and she comes back to you in a box. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4717.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, that's heartbreaking. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4722.32s)]
*  And after living through something like that, everything that he does, however, seems out [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4724.48s)]
*  of bounds, out of normal rules of conduct, of decorum. [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4731.44s)]
*  Well, you have to cut him some slack. [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4734.799999999999s)]
*  You have to understand it. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4736.879999999999s)]
*  He's become, to my mind, and I wrote about him a great deal in my book and elsewhere, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4738.839999999999s)]
*  an almost Captain Ahab figure who refuses to surrender, who's going on wherever it is, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4744.36s)]
*  who's doing his own investigation, who's trying to connect the dots any way he can. [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4750.16s)]
*  If he thinks I did something wrong, he's on my case. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4754.839999999999s)]
*  I understand that. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4757.5599999999995s)]
*  If he thinks the police did something wrong, he's on their case too. [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4758.84s)]
*  I mean, in many ways, he's a hero and yet he's also will be a victim forever of this case. [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4762.08s)]
*  All those families, that's the real tragedy. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4769.320000000001s)]
*  There are no survivors. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4772.52s)]
*  There are only victims. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4773.52s)]
*  Yeah, I do want to give credit to Steve, though. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4774.52s)]
*  He was outside the courthouse. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4775.52s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4776.52s)]
*  Go ahead, Matt. [[01:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4777.52s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4778.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4779.52s)]
*  You know, one thing to keep in mind here that I do want to say that I think the judge did [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4780.52s)]
*  is by continuing the sentencing hearing itself, under Idaho law, the court does not have to give [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4784.2s)]
*  the victims an opportunity to address the court. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4790.679999999999s)]
*  OK, so that's one thing that the judge didn't have to do, that he did do that is incredibly [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4793.24s)]
*  important for victims' families, including, hopefully, on that day, Mr. [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4797.88s)]
*  Gonzalez himself, because he'll be able to express that with Brian Coburger sitting in the room. [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4801.08s)]
*  And under the Crime Victims Bill of Rights that passed in 1994, but it is discretionary [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4806.76s)]
*  with the court. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4813.24s)]
*  So I do want to say kudos to the court for allowing the family to do that. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4814.24s)]
*  I think that was very appropriate. [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4817.599999999999s)]
*  And what he could have done, I guess, he could have imposed the sentence today. [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4819.8s)]
*  And so by putting that off, I do want to give him credit on that one point, because that [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4824.4s)]
*  is one of those things, even though everybody is going to know what the sentence is going [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4829.2s)]
*  to be. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4832.639999999999s)]
*  And I can tell you right now, he's not reducing any of these counts. [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4833.639999999999s)]
*  But when family members address the court, I've sat through a lot of those. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4837.32s)]
*  They are incredibly impactful and it does give them something. [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4841.92s)]
*  At least they get their moment in court where the defendant has to listen to them to talk [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4845.28s)]
*  about their grief. [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4849.68s)]
*  So you know, we heard that the judge say it was going to be July 22nd. [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4851.08s)]
*  It's been moved to July 23rd. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4855.4s)]
*  It's now going to be July 23rd. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4856.8s)]
*  I will say this. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4859.8s)]
*  You know, Steve Gonzalez was out there begging for the court to listen to him because he [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4861.04s)]
*  was very upset about how this went down. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4867.04s)]
*  And he was very upset that he did learn about the fact that there was a plea deal via email. [[01:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4869.52s)]
*  We talked about this a bit yesterday, Matt, via email. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4875.68s)]
*  And I just want you to remember that, the audience to remember that as we look back [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4878.4400000000005s)]
*  at this prosecutor. [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4881.68s)]
*  I'm just going to say it. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4883.4400000000005s)]
*  I think working up tears in that one moment. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4884.56s)]
*  I think it was an affectation meant by him to show, I'm connected to this case. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4887.96s)]
*  It's been very hard on me. [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4894.620000000001s)]
*  I'm a feeling person. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4896.080000000001s)]
*  I don't believe that I disregarded anybody's wishes in striking this deal because I really [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4897.84s)]
*  think we wouldn't be seeing a notification by email to the families that the guy's not [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4903.6s)]
*  going to be put to death and there's not going to be a trial if he deeply cared as he clearly [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4910.6s)]
*  wants us to believe in this. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4915.24s)]
*  It might be tears of relief that he can move on. [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4916.24s)]
*  He's finally done. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4919.4800000000005s)]
*  If that is true. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4921.2s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4922.2s)]
*  Watch. [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4923.2s)]
*  Stand by. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4924.2s)]
*  So, Your Honor. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4925.2s)]
*  At the end, the state's met the evidence that I've given just a quick overview of and that [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4926.2s)]
*  presenting court would consume weeks, which the state is prepared to do and has been prepared [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4932.24s)]
*  to do, which show that as the defendant has just admitted and pleaded guilty on November [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4937.08s)]
*  13th, 2022. [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4942.679999999999s)]
*  Excuse me. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4945.679999999999s)]
*  Mr. Coburger entered the residence of 1122 King Road in Moscow, Idaho. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4949.92s)]
*  He did that with the intent to kill. [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4955.12s)]
*  We will not represent that he intended to commit all of the murders that he did that [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4957.0s)]
*  night, but we know that that is what resulted and that he then killed intentionally, willfully, [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4962.08s)]
*  to deliberately with premeditation and with malice for thought. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4970.4s)]
*  Manny Mogin, Kayleigh Gonzales, Ethan Chapin, and Zahra Kroon. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4975.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4982.72s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4983.72s)]
*  Go ahead, Howard. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4986.0s)]
*  Well, he's a very good performer. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4987.0s)]
*  And this was his opportunity to have his final say and then move on. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4991.04s)]
*  I think it was a very contrived moment. [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4997.04s)]
*  I think he was milking it for all it was worth. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=4998.96s)]
*  And he can also be very tough. [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5002.04s)]
*  During one of the motions, filings, he got the defense witness to cry on the stand when [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5004.68s)]
*  he was coming at him so hard. [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5012.12s)]
*  Bill Thompson can be a very tough guy. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5016.04s)]
*  And I think this was a moment to show that even though he's making this deal, he cares. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5018.16s)]
*  I think that's why he went over the defense witness. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5023.88s)]
*  It seemed orchestrated to me. [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5025.5599999999995s)]
*  I have to be honest. [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5026.72s)]
*  It seemed like the timing of it, how it came just right at the last moment while he was [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5027.72s)]
*  closing. [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5031.5199999999995s)]
*  He's the Laetaw County prosecutor, Bill Thompson. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5032.5199999999995s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5034.68s)]
*  Matt, do you want to say something on it? [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5035.68s)]
*  Well, look, when men cry in court, it is among professional prosecutors. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5037.76s)]
*  That's a trope. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5044.320000000001s)]
*  We make fun of people for doing that. [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5045.320000000001s)]
*  It's not professional. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5047.4400000000005s)]
*  It comes off, whether it's legitimate or not in this case, it comes off as totally performative. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5049.96s)]
*  And also, if that's right, if Steve Gonzales, and I think he's been accurate, obviously [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5055.8s)]
*  he's very angry. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5062.68s)]
*  But if that's true, that they were notified in an email, you don't get to cry in court [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5064.200000000001s)]
*  when you talk about their daughter. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5069.6s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5071.0s)]
*  I mean, I got to call him out on that. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5072.0s)]
*  It's unprofessional. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5073.72s)]
*  There are prosecutors all across the country right now who just watched that, who ruled [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5074.96s)]
*  their eyes. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5078.96s)]
*  I guarantee it. [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5079.96s)]
*  And defense lawyers too. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5080.96s)]
*  The case is certainly tragic. [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5085.16s)]
*  It's not even tragic. [[01:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5086.88s)]
*  Tragedy is the wrong word. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5087.88s)]
*  Murder is not. [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5089.76s)]
*  Tragedy is what happens when somebody gets hit by a bus. [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5090.84s)]
*  OK, murder is different. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5093.16s)]
*  Murder is intended. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5094.64s)]
*  So it is as awful as it is. [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5096.02s)]
*  You can cry behind closed doors as you're going through the evidence. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5099.2s)]
*  But to cry publicly when Steve Gonzales refuses to go inside, I just I think people should [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5101.96s)]
*  have a problem with that. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5107.52s)]
*  And this guy, look, he said he was going for death. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5108.8s)]
*  Nothing appears to have changed. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5112.38s)]
*  And it looks like they blank. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5113.8s)]
*  He had all the evidence in the world. [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5115.16s)]
*  But I do want to say this. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5117.12s)]
*  It is horrible for the families when death penalty cases come back. [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5118.74s)]
*  I had to try cases that came back. [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5122.0599999999995s)]
*  My Rodney Alcala case. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5124.0599999999995s)]
*  I did the third trial of that. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5125.42s)]
*  It's brutal on the families. [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5127.38s)]
*  But that's why you put on a good case and you keep it streamlined and you do it right. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5129.38s)]
*  And you remove those issues on appeal. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5136.0599999999995s)]
*  And that's the business prosecution. [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5137.86s)]
*  I can't help but think of that. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5138.86s)]
*  In politics, the Democrats have been trying to trying out that taco thing. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5140.0599999999995s)]
*  This is before Trump dropped bombs on Iran. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5143.3s)]
*  Trump always chickens out. [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5145.9s)]
*  Thompson always chickens out. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5147.34s)]
*  He's a taco. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5149.58s)]
*  This guy Thompson, he chickened out. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5150.58s)]
*  That's how it seems to me. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5151.58s)]
*  It's certainly. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5152.58s)]
*  For once I agree with politics with you, Megan. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5153.58s)]
*  Everything goes back to politics. [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5157.26s)]
*  This is my life. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5158.26s)]
*  But Howard, I wanted to ask you when you watch, when you watch Kohlberger, because you've [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5159.26s)]
*  written books about this guy now, you've gone deep into his writings when he was a [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5161.98s)]
*  teenager. [[01:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5166.78s)]
*  Was it, what did you make of his snappy little, I know the answer. [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5167.78s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5170.94s)]
*  Yes. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5171.94s)]
*  Yes, I did. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5172.94s)]
*  I killed that human being and that one. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5173.94s)]
*  He was in control. [[01:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5177.38s)]
*  He was the best student. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5178.74s)]
*  His legal team, you can see they showed some emotion a little bit in their faces. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5181.46s)]
*  He had a haircut. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5186.82s)]
*  He didn't wear a suit jacket. [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5187.82s)]
*  He looked like he'd been working out. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5189.86s)]
*  His arms looked sort of pumped a little bit. [[01:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5191.22s)]
*  You know, it made you think that, you know, five terms in prison, four terms in prison, [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5196.58s)]
*  rather, is not going to be so hard for him. [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5202.58s)]
*  It's a travesty. [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5204.74s)]
*  It really is. [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5205.74s)]
*  Well, I meant to mention that to the audience. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5207.099999999999s)]
*  He was sitting there. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5209.0199999999995s)]
*  He was clean cut. [[01:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5210.0199999999995s)]
*  He didn't have any sort of facial hair. [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5211.0199999999995s)]
*  His hair looked like it had been recently cut. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5212.0199999999995s)]
*  It was closely cropped on the sides. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5213.42s)]
*  It looked a little lighter than I saw when he was first arrested. [[01:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5215.58s)]
*  And we saw him in the jumpsuit. [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5218.3s)]
*  It looked like a lighter brown as opposed to like the darker brown, at least from the [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5219.66s)]
*  feet I was watching. [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5224.74s)]
*  He was wearing a white button down for the listening audience. [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5226.099999999999s)]
*  He's wearing a white button down, like a man's work shirt that you'd wear to, you know, Wall [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5228.78s)]
*  Street and a blue-gray tie, but no jacket, which is interesting. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5233.0199999999995s)]
*  And he had one piece of paper in front of him and one pen. [[01:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5238.339999999999s)]
*  He was next to Ann Taylor and another female attorney. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5242.379999999999s)]
*  He had broad shoulders. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5245.299999999999s)]
*  He looked fit. [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5246.54s)]
*  He used to be morbidly obese and then got super into veganism and health and went on [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5247.54s)]
*  this tear after his heroin addiction and got super thin, which, you know, became a new [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5253.78s)]
*  sort of religion in his life from what we read. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5259.94s)]
*  I want to bring, do we have Phil now? [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5262.259999999999s)]
*  Phil Holloway is joining us. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5264.259999999999s)]
*  He's also here. [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5265.54s)]
*  No, he's not. [[01:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5266.5s)]
*  Okay, he's going to be here in a minute. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5267.219999999999s)]
*  So he'll join us with his thoughts on everything. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5268.099999999999s)]
*  Yeah, if I could just add to what you were saying. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5270.9s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5273.46s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5273.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5275.139999999999s)]
*  From a tactical perspective, you look at that and when you get into the penalty phase [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5276.58s)]
*  and the defense starts calling experts to talk about his autism or where he is on the [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5280.74s)]
*  spectrum and how he's not functional, what we saw as a guy who was sharp, who understood [[01:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5284.5s)]
*  the rules, he was attentive, he has all of that cuts the prosecution way in the penalty [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5289.14s)]
*  phase. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5295.54s)]
*  So that actually, in my eyes, it was very telling on the likelihood of the defense [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5296.18s)]
*  prevailing on any of those like mental health issues or any of that sort of thing. [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5301.860000000001s)]
*  Brian Coburger was, he was lucid. [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5307.22s)]
*  He understood everything that was going on and that is exactly why, once again, this [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5309.62s)]
*  is a death penalty case at the very beginning and it should still be a death penalty case now. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5314.18s)]
*  And you had some information. [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5318.66s)]
*  But you had information yesterday that you sent me, I read it to the audience, speculation [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5322.02s)]
*  about what may have led him to plead regarding his parents. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5325.78s)]
*  And let me just give you this bit of information from the courtroom about Coburger's parents [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5329.06s)]
*  and then you can fill things in, Howard. [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5333.46s)]
*  Brian Enton of NewsNations reporting as follows. [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5335.78s)]
*  Brian Coburger's parents are not crying, but they look sad, unlike their son who looks [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5338.26s)]
*  stone cold. [[01:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5345.06s)]
*  He admitted it all. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5346.580000000001s)]
*  I'm sitting behind his parents. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5347.860000000001s)]
*  So the parents were there today, maybe not his sisters from the sound of it. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5349.780000000001s)]
*  I'm not sure, but his parents were there. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5353.700000000001s)]
*  And that leads me back to Steve Goncalves because outside the courthouse this morning, [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5356.5s)]
*  he had a couple of odd comments. [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5362.1s)]
*  I mean, not well odd in that I didn't fully understand them about asking the news media [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5366.34s)]
*  to go check out when Brian Coburger's father bought his plane tickets to come out. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5371.78s)]
*  Do we have that sound bite, you guys? [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5378.26s)]
*  We can play it. [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5379.62s)]
*  Stand by. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5381.38s)]
*  Here it is. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5381.86s)]
*  Do you have any message for Coburger's family? [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5382.34s)]
*  Yeah, what do you want? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5386.179999999999s)]
*  We know when you flew out here. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5386.82s)]
*  We know, we know. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5389.0599999999995s)]
*  We have your flight records. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5391.0599999999995s)]
*  How are you preparing to see him today? [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5392.66s)]
*  I'm not going to see him. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5394.099999999999s)]
*  When you say you know the flight records, what do you mean, Steve? [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5396.98s)]
*  I know when his parents booked their flight. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5400.18s)]
*  When his father did. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5402.34s)]
*  What does that mean? [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5404.34s)]
*  You'll find out. [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5406.58s)]
*  Would you like to say something to them? [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5408.42s)]
*  The rest of your family went inside. [[01:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5415.38s)]
*  Is it important for them to be in there today? [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5417.3s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5419.62s)]
*  Where are you going? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5421.14s)]
*  Are you not able to get in? [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5421.9400000000005s)]
*  I'm getting out of this. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5423.06s)]
*  You're not staying in? [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5425.3s)]
*  First of all, it's remarkable because he's usually very composed. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5430.18s)]
*  And you can see today was tough for him. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5432.820000000001s)]
*  But what do you make of Coburger's family, their presence there, and what if any role [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5434.5s)]
*  they had in his reversal? [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5440.1s)]
*  Because all along, the word had been he's not taking a plea. [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5441.860000000001s)]
*  He wants to go to trial. [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5446.34s)]
*  What I discovered in the course of my reporting that early on, Anne Taylor had a sense that [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5448.900000000001s)]
*  this is a case that they would like to get a plea deal. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5453.9400000000005s)]
*  She approached Coburger and discussed it with him. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5458.900000000001s)]
*  This was before there was the alternate perpetrator ruling that was ruled out. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5462.9800000000005s)]
*  And he said no, because his mother was insisting that she did not want her son to admit to [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5466.820000000001s)]
*  guilt to these crimes. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5474.1s)]
*  Maybe she didn't believe he was guilty or whatever. [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5475.860000000001s)]
*  Then it seems, and this is what I've been told, this is what has been suggested to me, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5478.42s)]
*  that it's a matter of record that after the murders, on 6 a.m., he called for an hour [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5483.78s)]
*  at the parents' home in Pennsylvania. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5491.219999999999s)]
*  At 6 a.m., he spoke with his mother, not his father. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5493.86s)]
*  It was suggested that now the state was now going to call the mother to the stand and [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5498.74s)]
*  want to find out what was said during that phone call. [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5504.42s)]
*  That caused Coburger, as it was reported to me, a great deal of distress. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5508.0199999999995s)]
*  He did not want this to become public. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5512.34s)]
*  He also did not want, it was brought up to him, that his father would have to testify, [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5514.82s)]
*  perhaps, on the stand about what was said during their cross-country trip that I write [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5519.14s)]
*  about in great detail in my book and in the airmail articles. [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5523.38s)]
*  He wanted that to be kept secret too. [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5528.18s)]
*  So part of the reason I've been told that he finally agreed to tell his team, try to [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5531.06s)]
*  see if we can get a plea deal, was that he wanted to keep his parents from testifying. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5536.9800000000005s)]
*  He didn't want them to be put in a situation that might leave them in some sort of jeopardy, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5540.98s)]
*  might impugn their reputations in the community. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5546.179999999999s)]
*  He was trying to protect them. [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5548.82s)]
*  That led him to make his deal. [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5551.299999999999s)]
*  That's interesting what you just said, because I struggled with this yesterday asking, how [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5552.98s)]
*  can a sociopath who takes the lives so easily of four innocents then have empathy for his [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5558.82s)]
*  parents? [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5564.339999999999s)]
*  Like, well, gee, I don't want that. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5564.66s)]
*  But maybe it's not empathy. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5565.86s)]
*  It's that I don't want them to be in the position of like going to jail. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5567.219999999999s)]
*  I'm human being enough to say I don't want them becoming like the parents of that guy [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5571.86s)]
*  down in Florida, Brian Landry, who killed Gabby Petito. [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5577.94s)]
*  And it was very clear the parents knew what their son had done. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5582.179999999999s)]
*  They denied it. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5585.62s)]
*  But they've become the scourges of the nation because it was very clear that they let Gabby [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5586.5s)]
*  Petito's parents suffer while they knew their son had done something terrible. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5591.54s)]
*  These are the only anchors he has for the rest of his life in jail. [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5595.78s)]
*  He wants to protect them. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5600.58s)]
*  If he can get out of this quickly, everyone wants to just get this over with and move [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5602.9s)]
*  on. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5606.42s)]
*  And that's why I also find so distressing that the judge allowed this gag order to stay [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5606.9s)]
*  in place until after everything is done. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5611.219999999999s)]
*  So everything that reporters might find out would become ancient history by the time it [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5614.099999999999s)]
*  gets out there. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5620.42s)]
*  Well, I mean, they haven't been able to stop you, Howard. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5621.0599999999995s)]
*  It's been incredible the scoops you've gotten that we've then watched come alive as the [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5623.46s)]
*  case went on. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5628.02s)]
*  Scoop after scoop would be verified later as the I think in some of the cases, law [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5629.86s)]
*  enforcement got more bold about releasing some of their things. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5635.38s)]
*  And let me just ask you to follow up on that, Howard. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5637.78s)]
*  On that Dateline special that had so many previously unknown details, do you think that [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5639.7s)]
*  was law enforcement cooperating with Dateline? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5644.42s)]
*  Do you think there was some disgruntled cop who was like, this thing's not going the way [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5646.42s)]
*  I want it to go. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5651.38s)]
*  And I got to make sure this stuff gets out there. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5652.26s)]
*  I participated in that special. [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5655.46s)]
*  You were in it. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5659.06s)]
*  And I really don't want to comment on it and say about any of the sourcing on it. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5660.74s)]
*  I think it would be unfair to my involvement in there. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5667.22s)]
*  But just the producers did a tremendous job. [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5670.9800000000005s)]
*  They really broke this case open. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5674.74s)]
*  Oh, that's interesting. [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5677.860000000001s)]
*  I'm going to text you offline and then I'll get back to my audience in a way that's [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5678.74s)]
*  reportable. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5682.1s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5682.660000000001s)]
*  Phil Holloway joins us now. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5683.54s)]
*  He just beamed in. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5685.14s)]
*  We were on the air together not long ago talking about the Diddy trial. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5686.9800000000005s)]
*  And I have to say, Phil, what a bad day for justice this is. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5690.34s)]
*  What a bad day. [[01:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5694.18s)]
*  You know, Diddy gets off on the main charges against him and Brian Kohlberger didn't get [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5695.14s)]
*  away with murder, but his life is spared and he doesn't deserve it. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5699.620000000001s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5703.54s)]
*  You know, I'm joining this conversation with your other guests a little late and I'm not [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5705.22s)]
*  sure what their position may be on this. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5708.660000000001s)]
*  But look, as I said, as we were heading out of our earlier Diddy discussion in the last [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5710.66s)]
*  minute or so of that, I think this is a travesty. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5718.26s)]
*  I think that they had a closed open and closed case against Kohlberger. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5721.46s)]
*  I think it was an obvious conviction. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5726.66s)]
*  And after hearing this presentation today and the change of plea hearing, I'm even more [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5729.62s)]
*  settled in that conviction. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5737.139999999999s)]
*  They the only real reason that I can think of when I was a prosecutor, you know, we always [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5738.42s)]
*  were told that victims get a say in these things. [[01:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5744.26s)]
*  Now they don't get to drive the train. [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5748.1s)]
*  And I understand that maybe some of the victims families may have supported this, but you [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5750.26s)]
*  needed more unanimous agreement. [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5755.54s)]
*  The victims families needed to know the why of all this, I think, to get enough closure. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5759.38s)]
*  Now, I'm sure there's reasonable arguments on the other side of that as well. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5765.54s)]
*  You know, they don't have to live through the appeals process and thinking about this [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5769.06s)]
*  for the next several decades. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5773.62s)]
*  All those are valid points. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5774.98s)]
*  But if you have the victims, they're not honestly on board, then I don't see how they can go [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5777.14s)]
*  forward with a prosecution that does not include the death penalty. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5785.22s)]
*  Can can you Matt, can you go to the to the defendant who's come to you saying, please [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5790.18s)]
*  make an offer and say, I'll consider I'll consider life without parole if we get a [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5795.38s)]
*  full allocution from you. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5802.74s)]
*  We want to know the details of the families will not sign off on it. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5804.5s)]
*  And I'm just not going to do this without their blessing unless they have questions [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5807.86s)]
*  answered. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5811.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's what we need. [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5812.74s)]
*  Can you do that? [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5813.7s)]
*  A hundred percent. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5815.06s)]
*  You do that. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5815.86s)]
*  One hundred percent. [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5816.9800000000005s)]
*  That's available. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5817.78s)]
*  And the only thing is to keep in mind here, Megan, it's not life without possibility of [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5818.34s)]
*  parole. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5822.5s)]
*  It is 50 to life is what we're talking about consecutive sentences of burglary plus the [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5823.3s)]
*  four murders. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5827.7s)]
*  And that's 50 to life right now. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5828.820000000001s)]
*  Manage minimum until like you observed yesterday when we were talking about this, totally [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5830.58s)]
*  changed the law in Idaho. [[01:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5834.9800000000005s)]
*  Hopefully they don't. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5836.18s)]
*  But in California, where I am, our legislature changes the law to the benefit of defendants [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5837.14s)]
*  all the time. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5842.66s)]
*  And 50 years is an awful long time for that law to change. [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5843.38s)]
*  And especially when it comes to. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5846.18s)]
*  But this is a 10 year mandatory minimum. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5848.1s)]
*  So that's 10 years to life essentially for each one in Idaho. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5850.820000000001s)]
*  Stacking them consecutively means this is a determinant sentence. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5854.820000000001s)]
*  I believe at Sentencing Day, unless there's some provision in Idaho law I'm not aware [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5858.42s)]
*  of, he's looking at 50 to life, which means if he survives long enough, he would have [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5862.1s)]
*  an opportunity for a parole hearing. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5866.900000000001s)]
*  That's something that hasn't been discussed yet. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5868.660000000001s)]
*  But that's my reading of what I heard. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5871.14s)]
*  But how can that be? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5872.9800000000005s)]
*  Because they said, OK, I'm going to go to the next one. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5874.1s)]
*  Wait, but how can that be? [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5876.34s)]
*  Because they said they'll run consecutively, meaning one after the other. [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5877.46s)]
*  So it'd be 50 years potentially on each murder victim plus another 10 on the burglary. [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5881.46s)]
*  No, it's a 10 year minimum stacked up. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5888.34s)]
*  It's a 10 year minimum for each murder. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5892.9800000000005s)]
*  So like in California for a second degree murder, how are you shaking your head? [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5894.900000000001s)]
*  Did I do my math wrong? [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5898.42s)]
*  No, no, no, it's right. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5900.02s)]
*  It's just I'm shaking my head in disgust. [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5900.820000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5904.26s)]
*  You know, we talk about politics being the art of the deal. [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5904.82s)]
*  Well, this was Thompson's chance to make the deal. [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5907.86s)]
*  He had all the cards and he just blew it. [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5910.58s)]
*  And by the way, Philip, just so you know, everything you said, I agree with. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5913.54s)]
*  You basically have got everything I said to as another former prosecutor. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5917.62s)]
*  So you're telling me, Matt, just to back to your main point, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5922.66s)]
*  there actually is a chance under this deal that he could see the light of day again. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5925.38s)]
*  I think there's a good chance you'll get a parole hearing. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5929.38s)]
*  Hopefully, he's never given an opportunity and the parole boards in Idaho remain steady. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5933.78s)]
*  You know, but California, we've seen a huge shift to the left [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5939.860000000001s)]
*  and to people getting out. [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5944.02s)]
*  And the legislature has passed multiple laws that make it easier and easier for lifers to get out. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5945.9400000000005s)]
*  Life used to mean life in California. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5954.1s)]
*  And over the last 15 years, it has tacked very dramatically the opposite way. [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5955.78s)]
*  So who knows what's going to happen in Idaho? [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5960.5s)]
*  But that's the thing. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5962.98s)]
*  Elwap is not his sentence. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5964.339999999999s)]
*  He will get he will have a mandatory minimum time, I believe, based on this math of 50. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5965.86s)]
*  And it might even be less than that if burglary is less. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5971.299999999999s)]
*  He's going to he's agreeing to the 10. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5974.66s)]
*  But, you know, as I'm writing down the math and my math is usually wrong, but that's this is going [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5976.82s)]
*  to be, I believe, a 50 year to life sentence where he will do a mandatory minimum of 50 less the [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5983.139999999999s)]
*  burglary potentially. [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5990.02s)]
*  But he's going to be eligible for parole hearing based on what I heard today in court. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5991.3s)]
*  Wow. [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5994.9800000000005s)]
*  He's only 30 years old. [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5995.38s)]
*  He gets to make friends in jail. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=5998.5s)]
*  He gets to talk to his family. [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6001.860000000001s)]
*  He gets to see people on video calls. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6004.900000000001s)]
*  He gets to write letters. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6007.14s)]
*  He gets to read books. [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6008.42s)]
*  He gets to do all the things that these victims can't do. [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6010.02s)]
*  I mean, maybe he's in jail, but he gets to. [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6016.1s)]
*  He gets to make something of a life himself, life for himself, even if it's in prison. [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6019.22s)]
*  They don't get that. [[01:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6025.22s)]
*  He deserves to spend the next several decades not just working out the arts and crafts and the [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6026.42s)]
*  whatever kind of things he's going to get lined up for in prison. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6034.18s)]
*  He needs to spend the next several decades worrying about that firing squad. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6037.3s)]
*  Is he going to threading the needle? [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6041.7s)]
*  Are they going to aim right? [[01:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6043.7s)]
*  Is it going to be quick or am I going to feel the firing squad? [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6045.7s)]
*  That's the punishment. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6049.54s)]
*  That's what he needs to be thinking about over the next 50 or so years, [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6050.9s)]
*  not whether or not he gets to make his Skype calls every day. [[01:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6055.38s)]
*  And I think families need to have answers. [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6059.22s)]
*  They can't be left with for whatever reason or the evidence suggests. [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6064.099999999999s)]
*  And the taxpayers at Idaho who funded this whole thing for two and a half years, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6068.0199999999995s)]
*  this needs to be taken to a conclusion. [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6071.94s)]
*  Let's find out what happened. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6074.66s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6076.9s)]
*  Let me add to Philips comment real quick, Megan. [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6077.78s)]
*  When it comes to these types of deals, one of the things you hear in the death penalty [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6081.86s)]
*  debate so often is, well, it gives them a long time to sit in their cell and essentially think [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6085.38s)]
*  about what they did. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6090.98s)]
*  That again is humanizing the psychopath. [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6092.5s)]
*  Their brains don't work like that. [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6095.62s)]
*  They don't think like the rest of us. [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6099.0599999999995s)]
*  Otherwise, they wouldn't have committed the crime in the first place. [[01:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6101.299999999999s)]
*  They don't sit in their cell regretting what they did. [[01:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6103.78s)]
*  There's no such thing as regret in their mind. [[01:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6106.34s)]
*  So Philip is exactly right. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6108.26s)]
*  Phil really hit the nail on the head. [[01:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6110.58s)]
*  He's showing the audience the picture of him in the white shirt the morning after the murders [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6112.66s)]
*  with the thumbs up looking like psycho in front of a shower. [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6116.9s)]
*  Keep going, Matt. [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6119.86s)]
*  Does that guy look like somebody that's going to sit in his cell and regret anything that he did? [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6120.58s)]
*  I mean, that guy probably still has some DNA at the moment he took that photo of the victims [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6124.34s)]
*  on his body as he's given a thumbs up. [[01:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6130.26s)]
*  So that's not somebody that is going to regret anything in jail. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6132.42s)]
*  He looks like a vampire in that photo, by the way. [[01:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6135.7s)]
*  I mean, that's that is that guy is not going to jail. [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6137.86s)]
*  He's not going to sit in state prison and regret one thing that he did. [[01:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6141.54s)]
*  He's going to regret getting caught, but he will adjust. [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6144.9800000000005s)]
*  And just like just like Phil just pointed out, he's going to program and he's going to do the classes [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6147.9400000000005s)]
*  and he's going to probably finish out his PhD and he's going to he's going to talk to other inmates [[01:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6152.66s)]
*  and he has an opportunity to make friends and sit in a chat line and his family will get him a TV. [[01:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6157.54s)]
*  And it's it is absolutely not the same thing as sitting on death row, [[01:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6162.58s)]
*  especially someplace like Idaho that really might execute him, unlike California and some other [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6166.02s)]
*  states that have death penalty on the books, but it's not actually carried out. [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6172.18s)]
*  Idaho, if you actually face. [[01:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6175.78s)]
*  Yeah, here's what Kaylee Gonsalves is 18 year old sister Aubrey wrote in reaction to the news of [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6178.18s)]
*  the deal. [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6184.34s)]
*  Brian Kohlberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak, form relationships [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6185.14s)]
*  and engage with the world. [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6190.1s)]
*  Meanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever. [[01:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6191.7s)]
*  That reality stings more deeply when it feels like the system is protecting his future [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6194.58s)]
*  more than honoring the victims pasts. [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6199.22s)]
*  So well said by an 18 year old. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6201.78s)]
*  And by the way, again, to the point of like the judge couldn't even pronounce [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6203.54s)]
*  Zana Karnotl's name. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6207.0599999999995s)]
*  It's like, yes, it felt disrespectful. [[01:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6208.26s)]
*  Where were the victims there today? [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6210.5s)]
*  There wasn't really even a moment where we learned who they really were or anything about them. [[01:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6212.0199999999995s)]
*  There was absolutely no attempt to humanize the victims today by the judge or the prosecutor, [[01:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6217.94s)]
*  for that matter. [[01:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6222.74s)]
*  They were all but forgotten in there, Howard. [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6223.7s)]
*  Totally. [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6227.219999999999s)]
*  I mean, also to go back to the photograph we just showed of the thumbs up, that photograph [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6227.78s)]
*  was taken approximately 20 minutes after he got off off the hour phone call with his mother. [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6232.82s)]
*  So that's sort of the timeline. [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6239.379999999999s)]
*  Do you think he confessed to the mother? [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6240.98s)]
*  Is that what you're intimating? [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6243.54s)]
*  Hypothesis. [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6245.54s)]
*  I think things were said to her that made her perhaps realize something's not right. [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6246.26s)]
*  Just the same way that on the drive across the country, his father realized, was beginning [[01:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6252.66s)]
*  to realize, could my son be this monster? [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6258.26s)]
*  I mean, you're sitting shoulder to shoulder in a white Hyundai. [[01:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6261.3s)]
*  Every cop in the whole country is looking for a white Hyundai Elantra. [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6264.74s)]
*  You know your son has some problems. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6267.860000000001s)]
*  You put two and two together. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6270.42s)]
*  But and his sister too, right? [[01:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6271.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6274.1s)]
*  The sister was the one who really articulated it. [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6274.5s)]
*  At some point she goes to the father and confronts him. [[01:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6277.54s)]
*  And he, according to the reporting I've done, he walks off. [[01:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6280.18s)]
*  He doesn't make any comment. [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6284.02s)]
*  But slowly they are following this trail of footprints and they realize where it's [[01:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6285.46s)]
*  leading to them. [[01:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6289.7s)]
*  And I think this phone call, what happened on that phone call would have come up in [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6290.5s)]
*  the courtroom and it might have implicated them, might have put them in perhaps legal [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6295.46s)]
*  jeopardy. [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6300.26s)]
*  And that picture you're showing now, he looks like an army recruit with his shaved [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6301.3s)]
*  sort of sides and looking in good shape. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6305.780000000001s)]
*  Oh, he's definitely been working out. [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6308.42s)]
*  I mean, he's got like the broad shoulders now that what she didn't have before. [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6309.620000000001s)]
*  But there is one person who knew him almost as well as the family arguably. [[01:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6312.740000000001s)]
*  And that was his college professor, his master's degree professor, this Catherine [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6317.860000000001s)]
*  Ramsland, who hasn't spoken at all. [[01:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6322.42s)]
*  She has given no interviews because she was expected to be called as a witness by the [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6325.46s)]
*  prosecution. [[01:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6329.22s)]
*  But since the case has pled out, she feels free to speak. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6330.18s)]
*  And she gave an interview to NewsNation's Brian Enton last night. [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6334.34s)]
*  It was fascinating. [[01:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6337.62s)]
*  I'm going to show you guys a couple of pieces of it. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6339.46s)]
*  I showed one at the top of our show today, but I'm going to get into the substance here. [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6341.700000000001s)]
*  OK, so he asked her all the right questions like this one. [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6345.22s)]
*  Like, did you get the creepy vibe off of him is essentially what he's asking when he [[01:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6349.22s)]
*  was in your many classes. [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6354.740000000001s)]
*  And here's that in stop 43. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6355.9400000000005s)]
*  Was there anything looking back now that was strange about him or that you that you [[01:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6358.18s)]
*  noticed? [[01:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6364.02s)]
*  When I look back, there really isn't anything that stood out to me. [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6366.34s)]
*  I think when you're a teacher, your your instinct is to accept students at face value. [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6370.900000000001s)]
*  You don't, you know, start with suspicions or, you know, there really weren't any red [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6376.26s)]
*  flags. [[01:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6382.42s)]
*  He was always really quite respectful and grateful. [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6383.0599999999995s)]
*  He would thank me for things. [[01:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6388.099999999999s)]
*  He was attentive. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6390.0199999999995s)]
*  He would do the work. [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6391.86s)]
*  I didn't have any concerns. [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6394.5s)]
*  I just want the audience and you guys to hear we worked on this special with Howard in [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6397.459999999999s)]
*  December twenty twenty three, where we for a week got into this case. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6401.7s)]
*  And we pulled and Howard pulled Brian Kohlberger's old writings from his teenage years. [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6406.339999999999s)]
*  And this is just to the point that he let me play for you how sick he is. [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6411.9400000000005s)]
*  We had our producer voice over his Internet posts. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6416.26s)]
*  They were written. [[01:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6419.9400000000005s)]
*  This is not Brian Kohlberger's voice. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6420.74s)]
*  It's our producer's voice. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6422.1s)]
*  But this guy who you're about to hear had even Katherine Ramsland fooled about him [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6423.46s)]
*  being a good guy. [[01:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6428.900000000001s)]
*  He was just there to study criminology earnestly. [[01:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6429.78s)]
*  We'll start with here. [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6433.38s)]
*  Here, [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6434.74s)]
*  stop fifty six. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6436.74s)]
*  July 4th, 2011. [[01:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6441.22s)]
*  I've had this horrible depersonalization go on in my life for almost two years. [[01:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6443.78s)]
*  I feel like an organic sack of meat with no self-worth as I'm starting to view everything [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6448.58s)]
*  as this. [[01:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6454.0199999999995s)]
*  And then he goes on. [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6456.66s)]
*  Stop fifty five. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6457.62s)]
*  Watch. [[01:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6458.42s)]
*  May 12th, 2011. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6460.26s)]
*  I always feel as if I am not there completely depersonalized mentally. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6463.14s)]
*  I experienced fog, lack of comprehension at some times feel like my life is a movie. [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6468.42s)]
*  Depersonalization, depression, no interest in activity, constant thought of suicide, [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6475.06s)]
*  crazy thoughts, delusions of grandeur, anxiety, poor self-image, poor social skills, no emotion. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6481.78s)]
*  I feel like nothing has a point to it. [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6490.34s)]
*  When I get home, I am mean to my family. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6493.78s)]
*  This started when VS or visual snow did. [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6497.7s)]
*  I felt no emotion and along with the depersonalization, I can say and do whatever I want [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6501.38s)]
*  with a little remorse. [[01:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6506.34s)]
*  Everyone hates me. [[01:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6508.5s)]
*  Pretty much. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6510.34s)]
*  I am an asshole. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6511.7s)]
*  I'm just going to give you one more, Howard, because this one speaks to his relationship [[01:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6514.66s)]
*  with his family, soft 57. [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6518.34s)]
*  As I hug my family, I look into their faces. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6522.66s)]
*  I see nothing. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6525.14s)]
*  It is like I'm looking at a video game, but less. [[01:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6526.82s)]
*  I feel less than mentally damaged. [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6530.1s)]
*  It is like I have severe brain damage. [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6532.900000000001s)]
*  I'm stuck in the depths of my mind. [[01:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6536.42s)]
*  I say, hug my family. [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6539.9400000000005s)]
*  I feel nothing. [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6541.06s)]
*  But he that same guy who would then go on to get addicted to heroin, but then get off [[01:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6542.74s)]
*  of it, started straightening out his life and wound up in front of one of the foremost [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6546.98s)]
*  criminal justice and forensic experts in the world at this college in Pennsylvania. [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6551.54s)]
*  And she was totally fooled by him. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6557.0599999999995s)]
*  That's what she told Brian Enton last night. [[01:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6560.099999999999s)]
*  There wasn't an inkling, Howard, that she was dealing with her own serial killer. [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6562.099999999999s)]
*  That's what she says. [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6568.74s)]
*  What's also a matter of record is that several days after a Coburger was caught, the [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6570.099999999999s)]
*  Coburger was caught in Pennsylvania. [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6576.18s)]
*  She calls up the family. [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6578.18s)]
*  She offers to help. [[01:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6580.02s)]
*  According to Coburger's Pennsylvania attorney, the family wouldn't meet with him until they [[01:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6581.540000000001s)]
*  were cleared by Dr. Ranslen. [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6586.820000000001s)]
*  So she's been involved in this in the beginning. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6589.14s)]
*  Brian Enton, who's a great reporter, tenacious reporter. [[01:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6592.42s)]
*  He's been far ahead in the story than just about anyone else. [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6596.02s)]
*  He got Dr. Ranslen to say very shrewdly, do you intend to do a book? [[01:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6600.1s)]
*  Would you like to see him? [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6604.26s)]
*  And she says, yeah, I would. [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6605.86s)]
*  And I think that's what she's been trying to from the beginning. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6607.22s)]
*  Well, I mean, everyone wants to read that. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6610.74s)]
*  I mean, you because we do want answers. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6612.42s)]
*  So before I get to that piece of her interview, he asked her, of course, the question about [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6614.26s)]
*  like first, first he asked, what did you make of it when you heard that your star student, [[01:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6618.26s)]
*  who you recommended for this PhD program in Washington state, had been arrested and [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6624.099999999999s)]
*  charged with these murders? [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6628.9s)]
*  And here's her reaction to that in SOP 45. [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6631.7s)]
*  What did you think when you first heard that Brian Coburger, your former student, was arrested [[01:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6634.34s)]
*  for this? [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6641.139999999999s)]
*  I was completely floored. [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6643.3s)]
*  I didn't believe it. [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6645.46s)]
*  And his demeanor that we saw on media was that he was confident that he was going to be able [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6647.94s)]
*  to prove his innocence. [[01:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6656.82s)]
*  So I wanted to wait and see. [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6658.82s)]
*  I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6660.82s)]
*  But as months go by and he kept saying that he had an alibi, and I wondered, well, why [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6664.0199999999995s)]
*  are you sitting in jail? [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6670.099999999999s)]
*  Give us your alibi. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6673.139999999999s)]
*  Get out. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6674.259999999999s)]
*  And that wasn't happening. [[01:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6675.219999999999s)]
*  And then it was really when he said his alibi and it was clearly not an alibi. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6677.62s)]
*  And he would have known that certainly from all the classes that he had through [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6684.099999999999s)]
*  undergraduate and graduate work. [[01:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6689.86s)]
*  He would have understood that wasn't really an alibi. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6692.02s)]
*  I think that was when I was really floored that this is my student who has done these things. [[01:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6695.700000000001s)]
*  That is so telling because we all watched this and he said he had an alibi. [[01:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6707.860000000001s)]
*  We all waited. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6712.26s)]
*  His lawyers and his reporters, where's the alibi? [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6712.9800000000005s)]
*  Great. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6716.580000000001s)]
*  Lay it on us. [[01:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6716.900000000001s)]
*  Let us test it. [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6717.780000000001s)]
*  It came out that he was driving around at night stargazing. [[01:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6719.139999999999s)]
*  So even his mentor in the criminal justice field heard that and that's when she knew [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6723.46s)]
*  he did it. [[01:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6729.38s)]
*  That was remarkable. [[01:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6730.74s)]
*  Anybody want to take that one? [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6731.78s)]
*  Well, at that moment, Ann Taylor must have realized in the back of her mind, [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6733.54s)]
*  my client is guilty and she has to be thinking, how am I going to plea out of this? [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6737.46s)]
*  How can I prevent him from going to a firing squad? [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6741.78s)]
*  I'll give it to you in a second, Phil. [[01:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6745.7s)]
*  But Ann Taylor, by the way, you're despicable. [[01:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6746.82s)]
*  You are despicable because you knew your client had done this and you did a fine job [[01:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6748.98s)]
*  representing him, but you were about to go into trial and try to blame four other people by name. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6754.74s)]
*  She was going to blame four guys, you guys. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6760.099999999999s)]
*  She and Brian Kohlberger were going to team up and go point the finger at people they knew [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6762.82s)]
*  were innocent and only this judge, Hippler, important to emphasize, it's a P, not a T [[01:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6768.42s)]
*  in the middle of that name, stop them. [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6775.46s)]
*  And that's what put him in this compromise position. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6778.02s)]
*  Go ahead, Phil. [[01:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6780.02s)]
*  Yeah, you can't go and just willy-nilly blame people without one scintilla of evidence and [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6781.3s)]
*  the judge absolutely made the right call. [[01:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6787.46s)]
*  But speaking of the study of criminology and criminal justice, my undergraduate degree is in [[01:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6789.46s)]
*  criminal justice and so I consider myself sort of a lifelong student of crime and criminology. [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6795.86s)]
*  And so it occurs to me, you know, this person has he has this arrogance about him. [[01:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6802.26s)]
*  Okay. [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6808.42s)]
*  It's what it that's what comes across to me when I see the selfies and all of that stuff that where [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6808.820000000001s)]
*  he's like proud of what he's done. [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6814.900000000001s)]
*  So think about moving forward for him. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6816.820000000001s)]
*  He's going to have criminologists and psychologists and people in academia. [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6819.46s)]
*  They're going to be going to visit him in prison for as long as he's there and they're going to [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6826.26s)]
*  be studying him and he's going to enjoy it. [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6832.98s)]
*  It's going to feed into his arrogance and it's going to make him feel like he's done something [[01:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6836.18s)]
*  now to finally put himself on the map to be worth something in the world. [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6844.34s)]
*  To me, that is why this plea deal is so tragic because he gets to spend his days having his [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6849.86s)]
*  ego stroked by academicians as opposed to sitting there worrying about whether or not the firing [[01:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6857.7s)]
*  squad is going to hit the right place. [[01:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6864.099999999999s)]
*  I don't know that the prosecutor has given any of that one fault as far as determining what is [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6867.22s)]
*  justice in this particular case because I don't know where we're on pins and needles to see if [[01:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6875.0599999999995s)]
*  Katherine Ramsland is going to get the interview she wants. [[01:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6879.3s)]
*  Here's that exchange in SOP 48. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6882.5s)]
*  Would you want to study Brian Koberger? [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6888.02s)]
*  Have you put any thought into that? [[01:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6892.34s)]
*  Is that something that you think could be possible? [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6894.34s)]
*  I've been thinking about that for two and a half years. [[01:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6898.26s)]
*  I would. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6901.9400000000005s)]
*  I mean, this is my work. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6902.900000000001s)]
*  If he wanted to do that, I would. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6905.22s)]
*  I know that he's got the intellectual capacity to do it, to be self-reflective, to help [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6908.74s)]
*  think through how his life came to this. [[01:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6914.58s)]
*  So I would definitely do it if he were willing. [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6918.0199999999995s)]
*  It would be hard. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6922.66s)]
*  But I think because I have so much material from him, [[01:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6924.0199999999995s)]
*  I have questions for him that I think nobody else but me could ask. [[01:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6928.26s)]
*  Fair enough. [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6934.0199999999995s)]
*  Matt Murphy, there's nothing to stop that from happening, right? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6934.66s)]
*  She's allowed to go do it. [[01:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6937.94s)]
*  I was talking to Ashley Banfield yesterday on her podcast saying, [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6939.299999999999s)]
*  we watched this happen in the Watts trial where the father who killed his wife and their two baby [[01:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6942.339999999999s)]
*  girls and put them in the disgusting towers and let them anyway, it was awful. [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6948.5s)]
*  He started talking when he got into jail. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6954.5s)]
*  He got a girlfriend. [[01:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6956.5s)]
*  He had law enforcement come visit him and he started singing like a canary. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6957.62s)]
*  Once he got behind bars and a couple of years had passed and he no longer cared. [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6961.7s)]
*  Well, one of the things that's really interesting about what we just listened to, [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6965.06s)]
*  Megan, on the thing that he wrote, he hit on there's a thing called the hair psychopathy [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6969.46s)]
*  checklist that has essentially the character traits of a psychopath. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6975.620000000001s)]
*  And when he talks about having no remorse and grandiosity, [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6981.46s)]
*  all of those are horrific signs of the psychopath. [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6985.700000000001s)]
*  And what I think is really interesting about [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6988.9800000000005s)]
*  Catherine Ramson is that it speaks like her. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6992.18s)]
*  The fact that she had no clue is one of the insidious things about serial killers and [[01:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=6996.34s)]
*  about psychopaths is that they tend to be highly intelligent. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7002.34s)]
*  They tend to be manipulative and charming and they could be in line in front of us at a Starbucks [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7005.7s)]
*  and we would never know. [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7010.820000000001s)]
*  And that is one of the fascinating things and one of the scary things about this personality type. [[01:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7012.1s)]
*  I think it's very, very interesting that letter that we just listened to that he wrote because [[01:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7019.22s)]
*  he basically checks off a bunch of the hallmark things and saying that he's got no remorse. [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7025.46s)]
*  And then the one thing he absolutely got right that he was honest about is when he called [[01:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7031.14s)]
*  himself an asshole because at the bottom line, that's what these guys are. [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7035.22s)]
*  And not every psychopath turns into a murderer. [[01:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7039.78s)]
*  In fact, most of them don't, but they're always, they put themselves first. [[01:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7042.0199999999995s)]
*  They're highly narcissistic. [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7045.86s)]
*  They tend to, you know, they have no morals. [[01:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7047.22s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with the moral compass. [[01:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7051.06s)]
*  They know right from wrong, but they choose to do the wrong thing when it benefits them. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7053.06s)]
*  And sometimes it's just benefiting their sorted sexual desires. [[01:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7058.1s)]
*  So I think that this case is interesting. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7062.18s)]
*  And look to the extent that he would participate, maybe she can learn something. [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7064.34s)]
*  Who knows? [[01:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7068.740000000001s)]
*  But this case is fascinating. [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7070.26s)]
*  As tragic as it is today, it's fascinating. [[01:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7072.5s)]
*  He asked her the $64,000 question, which is it gets to what I think she was about to testify to. [[01:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7074.98s)]
*  She is as interesting as all that was. [[01:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7079.94s)]
*  It's not what she was going to testify to. [[01:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7081.86s)]
*  The question is like, what did you see about him? [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7083.459999999999s)]
*  And what did you teach in the class that might be relevant to this case? [[01:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7086.099999999999s)]
*  And here is that, which is the most newsmaking piece of the interview in. [[01:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7091.0599999999995s)]
*  What is it? [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7096.5s)]
*  Sat. [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7097.139999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7098.58s)]
*  44. [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7098.82s)]
*  You guys got it. [[01:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7099.299999999999s)]
*  Can you say Dr. Ramslyn what it was looking back now? [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7100.66s)]
*  That sort of raises your eyebrows specifically in terms of things in the class. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7105.219999999999s)]
*  I think just the idea of wanting to study [[01:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7112.339999999999s)]
*  offenders and what their thought process was, how they felt about their crimes. [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7117.139999999999s)]
*  Wanting to study that and then finding out that this is a person who then is now [[01:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7125.139999999999s)]
*  saying he's guilty of doing these things. [[01:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7132.34s)]
*  I have to look at the framework of what I taught and wonder, did I inspire him in some way? [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7134.820000000001s)]
*  Did I, but I can't second guess that because I may have inspired somebody else to become an FBI agent. [[01:59:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7141.38s)]
*  And that's unfortunately in this field, that's what we live with. [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7152.1s)]
*  That's what we live with. [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7156.26s)]
*  I'll give that one to you, Matt, because you're also on the side of, [[01:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7161.860000000001s)]
*  they say there's a fine line sometimes between the cop and the criminal. [[01:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7164.34s)]
*  She was an interesting person. [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7169.22s)]
*  She sort of had a light affect throughout the interview. [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7170.740000000001s)]
*  She was smiling. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7172.820000000001s)]
*  I think it's probably, I'm not judging her when you're a reporter even, [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7175.3s)]

*  You guys know that too. [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7180.34s)]
*  You've reported on enough cases, just as legal commentators and you as a journalist, Howard. [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7181.14s)]
*  Sometimes you laugh in inappropriate situations and with your team, you just have to because [[01:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7185.700000000001s)]
*  you deal so much in darkness and that's her life. [[01:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7189.38s)]
*  But I do wonder, how do you go to sleep at night if you think you inspired Brian Kohlberger? [[01:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7192.820000000001s)]
*  Well, yeah, I think that this is almost like family members and it's a chicken or egg thing. [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7200.18s)]
*  I think that psychopaths are born far more often than they're actually made. [[02:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7206.580000000001s)]
*  That's my personal opinion and having dealt with a bunch of them, including [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7211.46s)]
*  them that represented themselves in court, which is another hallmark of the psychopathic [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7215.139999999999s)]
*  slash extreme narcissist personality. [[02:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7218.98s)]
*  But this isn't her fault and it's not his family's fault. [[02:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7221.86s)]
*  I haven't heard one inkling of grew abuse, but so often you don't. [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7225.219999999999s)]
*  That's another big myth when it comes to serial killers, Megan, is that what could possibly have [[02:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7230.82s)]
*  made them do that? [[02:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7235.219999999999s)]
*  And we all harken back to Buffalo Bill from Silence of the Lambs. [[02:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7236.0199999999995s)]
*  And we think about these tortured souls that were subject to horrific abuse. [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7238.9s)]
*  The reality is most of these guys, the big answer is why do they do it? [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7243.14s)]
*  It's because they want to do it. [[02:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7247.9400000000005s)]
*  They get off on it. [[02:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7249.3s)]
*  They enjoy it. [[02:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7250.26s)]
*  And for lack of a better term, as disturbing as it is, it's fun for them. [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7251.06s)]
*  And that's not this woman's fault. [[02:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7256.58s)]
*  I think it's the other way around. [[02:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7257.780000000001s)]
*  I think he was fascinated. [[02:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7258.820000000001s)]
*  He was drawn to it. [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7259.860000000001s)]
*  He went into this because of who he was to begin with. [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7261.06s)]
*  I don't think she made him. [[02:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7264.42s)]
*  And as far as the gal's humor, yeah, she's removed from that. [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7266.660000000001s)]
*  I don't think she meant to be, you know, unsensitive or insensitive to the victims [[02:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7269.86s)]
*  or their families. [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7275.0599999999995s)]
*  She's an academic. [[02:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7276.98s)]
*  And at the end of the day, it's not her fault. [[02:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7279.62s)]
*  It's usually not family members' fault, usually. [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7282.82s)]
*  This lands on the shoulders of Brian Coburger himself. [[02:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7286.74s)]
*  And to deal today, that is the responsibility of that prosecutor that cut him the break. [[02:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7289.38s)]
*  Here's a defense for the prosecutor just in from the family of Maddie Mogin, Kaylee's best friend. [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7295.46s)]
*  This is via NBC News. [[02:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7303.139999999999s)]
*  Her family's saying they support the plea agreement 100%. [[02:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7305.219999999999s)]
*  In a statement read by their attorney outside of the courthouse, the family members thanked [[02:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7308.98s)]
*  Laetaw County prosecutor Bill Thompson as those who do not support the agreement to, [[02:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7312.9s)]
*  quote, respect our belief that this is the best outcome possible for the victims, [[02:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7317.139999999999s)]
*  their families in the state of Idaho. [[02:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7320.98s)]
*  We lost our Maddie. [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7322.66s)]
*  Our kind, loving, vivacious and caring daughter full of purpose and promise. [[02:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7323.94s)]
*  We are grateful for the gift of her life and we have grieved the loss of that life during [[02:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7328.179999999999s)]
*  each of these 962 days. [[02:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7332.179999999999s)]
*  God, that feels so real when you're when you've lost somebody, especially to violent crime, [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7334.98s)]
*  to be counting it in the number of days. [[02:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7340.82s)]
*  I mean, that's that sounds so real. [[02:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7342.82s)]
*  And so there is a split. [[02:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7345.78s)]
*  I mean, does that change your opinion at all, Phil Holloway, about the prosecution's decision? [[02:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7347.139999999999s)]
*  You've got Maddie's parents in support of it. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7351.62s)]
*  You've got Ethan's parents in support of it. [[02:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7354.34s)]
*  You've got Steve Gonsalves against it. [[02:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7356.66s)]
*  And we don't know about Zanna's parents. [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7358.34s)]
*  You know, it doesn't change my opinion on balance because I felt like unless there was [[02:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7361.62s)]
*  unanimity on the on the part of the victims families, they needed to go forward as planned. [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7366.58s)]
*  But now that being said, I do fully understand where this family is coming from, because [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7372.9s)]
*  after all, they don't have to sit through this trial that would have lasted for weeks on end. [[02:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7378.18s)]
*  They would have been there every day, no doubt. [[02:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7382.5s)]
*  They don't have to worry every time there's an appeals court that issues a ruling that [[02:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7384.820000000001s)]
*  might overturn something and require a second trial. [[02:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7390.58s)]
*  They don't have to worry for the next several decades whether there's going to be something [[02:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7394.820000000001s)]
*  that undoes this trial and they got to live through it all over again. [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7399.700000000001s)]
*  And then they don't have to relive it when that moment of execution were it ever to [[02:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7402.900000000001s)]
*  arrive. All of these things would have kept the memory of this horrible tragedy in their lives [[02:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7407.78s)]
*  at the front and center for the rest of their lives. [[02:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7415.94s)]
*  And at some point, I think we all as human beings know that families need to be able to [[02:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7418.34s)]
*  move on. They need a little bit of closure. [[02:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7423.219999999999s)]
*  And so I fully understand why certain families, including that one, would support [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7425.62s)]
*  ending the proceedings in this way. [[02:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7432.98s)]
*  However, I think that there's also a broader societal interest in having this case tried to [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7435.46s)]
*  the public or in public so that we could have seen behind the curtain and we could have learned the [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7441.78s)]
*  why of it all because apparently we're never going to learn why he did this. [[02:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7446.5s)]
*  We can study it. We can speculate. [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7451.7s)]
*  Unless Catherine gets it out of him. Maybe he'll talk to his former teacher. [[02:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7453.22s)]
*  Maybe he's looking forward to being studied by her, Phil. [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7456.34s)]
*  Maybe he will. But is he going to ever tell the truth? [[02:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7459.46s)]
*  We don't know. We don't know. [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7461.86s)]
*  I understand the victims who do want to get this behind them. [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7463.700000000001s)]
*  And look, I just think on balance, if I were the prosecutor, I would have wanted all of the [[02:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7467.06s)]
*  families on board with this. Can I add to that, Megan, real briefly? [[02:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7472.820000000001s)]
*  You get that information from the families before you announce whether or not you're seeking for the [[02:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7477.3s)]
*  death penalty. You factor that in California, we call it a lives hearing. [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7481.06s)]
*  And it's a very important, sober, formal process that a DA goes through. [[02:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7486.34s)]
*  And you have all the time in the world to announce that there's no statute or time [[02:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7492.02s)]
*  limit on how long it takes to consider that. And a good DA will consider all those factors [[02:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7496.740000000001s)]
*  before they make their announcement. And I don't see why that wasn't considered here ahead of time. [[02:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7501.9400000000005s)]
*  Again, you make the call based on the information you have, all those families were available to [[02:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7506.900000000001s)]
*  talk to him. And I offer zero criticism to any of the family members in this. [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7511.38s)]
*  But my criticism is directed at the DA. He should have learned all that before he announced he was [[02:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7516.42s)]
*  seeking the death penalty. So you don't go after it and then change your mind down the line. [[02:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7521.62s)]
*  All that was available at the time. I just want to add a little bit more color. [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7526.099999999999s)]
*  Stand by, Howard, then you can take it. Via NBC inside the courtroom, several family members [[02:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7531.14s)]
*  seated in the gallery were crying as the hearing went on. Christy Gonzalez, that's Kaylee's mom, [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7536.42s)]
*  silently sobbed as the judge read Kaylee's name. An aunt of Kaylee's had her head down, [[02:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7543.14s)]
*  holding her forehead. It was also weeping. The aunt also sobbed when prosecutors spoke about [[02:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7547.86s)]
*  blood on the murder weapon, which that was the first time I'd heard that the girl's blood [[02:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7552.82s)]
*  was on the knife sheath, that they found blood on the knife sheath in addition to [[02:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7557.0599999999995s)]
*  Kohlberger's DNA. Madison Mogan's father, Ben, looked agitated, was breathing heavily, rubbing [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7562.179999999999s)]
*  his eyes with a handkerchief. He did not look at Kohlberger while he answered the judge's questions. [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7568.339999999999s)]
*  I'm sure he couldn't even, I mean, think about it as a dad, Madison Mogan's father, Ben, and [[02:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7573.14s)]
*  Kaylee's father, Steve, couldn't even go in there. I mean, he couldn't go in there and Ben couldn't [[02:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7579.14s)]
*  look at him because, of course, it's a dad's job. Every dad knows this and feels this to protect his [[02:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7584.740000000001s)]
*  daughter. And these girls were young. They were 21 years old and their dads weren't there. And, [[02:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7591.22s)]
*  of course, no one would have expected them to be there, but that would be your feeling [[02:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7597.700000000001s)]
*  as you sat there or got the news about what had happened to them that day. The human element here [[02:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7601.780000000001s)]
*  is just so jarring, guys. It was a moment of high drama and that makes the district attorney's [[02:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7607.860000000001s)]
*  behavior so capricious. I mean, it's just uncivilized and rude not to have confronted them [[02:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7616.740000000001s)]
*  first and tell them exactly what's happening to guide them through this, to try to make this entire [[02:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7623.860000000001s)]
*  horrible experience as easy as possible. It can be. It's going to be an impossible experience [[02:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7629.7s)]
*  anyway. Your duty as a public servant and as a feeling human being is to help them through this [[02:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7635.3s)]
*  and not just give them emails telling them what's happening. Yeah, and that's the real, [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7642.099999999999s)]
*  that's the real, I think that's almost the worst of it as a father, you know, of a daughter [[02:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7647.0599999999995s)]
*  and a son. But these college girls, they look like they could easily be any of our children. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7654.900000000001s)]
*  To think about, you're just going to get this information by an email. I mean, it's just... [[02:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7665.46s)]
*  I know, you're searching up your random correspondence and then you learn this. [[02:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7671.14s)]
*  It's rude. It's just bad form. And I hope the voters in Idaho remember how this case was dealt [[02:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7676.02s)]
*  with in the end because, you know, whether or not they did a good job in their legal presentations [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7683.14s)]
*  in court and argued the motions correctly and did all the right things, the way they went about [[02:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7689.9400000000005s)]
*  informing these families of the conclusion of this is just, in my view, unforgivable, [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7696.34s)]
*  utterly unforgivable. And by the way, to the point that we were discussing earlier, and Matt said, [[02:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7702.58s)]
*  this is totally possible. The thing that Steve Gonsalves said first, he said, it's not over [[02:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7706.9800000000005s)]
*  till the plea is accepted. And he did want people to contact the courthouse to express their thoughts, [[02:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7712.26s)]
*  which he was chastised for. But secondly, he said, at a bare minimum, I'm reading here, [[02:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7716.26s)]
*  please require a full confession, full accountability, location of the murder weapon, [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7721.22s)]
*  confirmation the defendant acted alone, and the true facts of what happened that night. [[02:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7727.14s)]
*  We deserve to know when the beginning of the end was. Oh my God, that is so well put. And I can [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7731.9400000000005s)]
*  understand a dad's need to know that when when did my daughter come into your mind as the subject [[02:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7740.26s)]
*  of murder? And we do believe not Steve's daughter, but we believe that Maddie Morgan was the original [[02:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7746.9800000000005s)]
*  intended victim. We'll put their pictures back up because we understand that Kaylee had already left [[02:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7753.62s)]
*  this. It's Ethan. And then that's Maddie. And then and then that's Kaylee. And then that's Zana, [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7760.5s)]
*  the Burnett. OK, so we believe that Maddie, who's next to Ethan in this photo, was his intended [[02:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7767.22s)]
*  victim because she was the one he went right up to the third floor. He didn't even stop at the second [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7772.820000000001s)]
*  floor. He clearly knew where she was. And Kaylee's presence in the bed that night or even in the house [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7777.38s)]
*  was unexpected. She had moved out. She was only back for a night. So we the speculation is that [[02:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7781.860000000001s)]
*  he was surprised to find Kaylee again there in the sunglasses that he was surprised to find her in [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7787.62s)]
*  with Maddie. And, you know, you hear Maddie's parents just weeping at the mention of her name [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7793.86s)]
*  and all these others whose children got swept into it because the psychopath entered an unlocked [[02:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7799.139999999999s)]
*  house, which is true of virtually all college houses, at least before this, who wanted to do [[02:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7803.86s)]
*  a dastardly deed. I got to pause and I'm going to say goodbye to you, Howard. And I'm just going to [[02:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7810.74s)]
*  hold the other guys over for a minute on Diddy. Thank you, Howard, for everything on this case. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7815.54s)]
*  You're great reporting and commentary. It's always a pleasure. You guys, I want to switch [[02:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7819.86s)]
*  all the best. I want to switch to Diddy before we say goodbye because they had to submit their [[02:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7825.219999999999s)]
*  suggested program on whether Diddy would be released or would be in jail pending sentencing. [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7832.42s)]
*  And they did that as far as we can see around 1 30. We got one of the submissions. I'm assuming [[02:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7839.54s)]
*  that we got the other one. Let's see. The inner city press was reporting at 2 p.m. [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7846.42s)]
*  Submissions just now of the bail letters by Combs and the U.S. Attorney's Office are in. [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7852.34s)]
*  The judge will reconvene the parties at 5 p.m. And I guess he'll make his decision then. But [[02:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7857.06s)]
*  it's pretty crazy. The reaction that we're getting now from the families, the mother walked out of [[02:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7864.74s)]
*  the courtroom blowing kisses to the fans. Diddy's mother, who is a bizarre, they have a bizarre [[02:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7871.14s)]
*  relationship. I'm sorry. There's strange videos on the Internet of them calling each other baby [[02:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7875.9400000000005s)]
*  and kissing on the mouth. Like recently, it's strange. And now we, let's see, here's his mother [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7880.26s)]
*  waving and kissing the crowd. Now the New York Times reporting a lawyer for Cassandra Ventura [[02:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7888.9800000000005s)]
*  submitted a letter to the judge urging him to deny Mr. Combs's request for release on bond. [[02:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7893.780000000001s)]
*  That's Doug Wigdor. He wrote that Ms. Ventura believes Mr. Combs is likely to pose a danger [[02:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7898.0199999999995s)]
*  to the victims who testified in this case, including herself, as well as to the community. [[02:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7902.099999999999s)]
*  Exactly. That's what we were trying to say earlier, Phil. Like, yes, agreed. So does the [[02:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7905.94s)]
*  judge take that into consideration now that we've heard directly from one of the witnesses and one [[02:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7911.86s)]
*  of his victims? You know, it's a no-brainer. He's been convicted. He's lost the presumption of [[02:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7916.179999999999s)]
*  innocence, at least as to the counts he was convicted of. And so, you know, he's, he is [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7921.78s)]
*  somehow he's, it makes more sense to give him a bond now. No, what makes sense is to go ahead and [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7927.38s)]
*  continue letting him serve his time now that, that I, if I were the judge, know that I'm going to be [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7933.0599999999995s)]
*  giving him when the sentencing occurs down the road in a few weeks. Look, he's going to be a danger [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7939.3s)]
*  to others. These people know it. The Cassie and the other victims, they know it. They know that [[02:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7944.74s)]
*  their best hope for safety is if he is locked up and, and, and does not have that much access to [[02:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7950.98s)]
*  the outside world, certainly sending him home to live at his home in Miami beach, would not give [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7957.54s)]
*  any great comfort to these victims. He, what this judge is doing, he's delaying. And we talked about [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7963.379999999999s)]
*  this some earlier because he's, he's consulting with his colleagues to determine whether or not [[02:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7968.419999999999s)]
*  he needs to just act on this and say, look, we're going to keep him in jail or to release him on [[02:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7973.379999999999s)]
*  bond. It ought to be automatic. He's been convicted. There's jail time. That's probably in his future. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7979.7s)]
*  He needs to just stay put. We don't need to be sitting here waiting until five o'clock on some [[02:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7985.94s)]
*  decision. That should have just been automatic. It's entirely within the discretion of the judge. [[02:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7990.74s)]
*  He should have immediately said, Nope, we're not even going to entertain that at this time. [[02:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=7995.38s)]
*  Sentencing is going to be set for, you know, August 10th or whatever and just move on, [[02:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8000.099999999999s)]
*  move on to the set. Just to keep it clear for the audience, this is because we're talking about [[02:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8005.0599999999995s)]
*  judges now we've switched. We've moved to the east and to the north. And now we're in a different [[02:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8007.46s)]
*  courtroom. This is federal court in the Diddy case and judge supermanian, a Biden appointee, [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8013.06s)]
*  who's relatively new to the bench and has to decide not the guilt or innocence of Sean Diddy [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8017.86s)]
*  Combs. That was decided earlier today, guilty on two small counts, smaller and not guilty on the [[02:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8023.14s)]
*  main charges against him for Rico and sex trafficking. And now this judge has to set a [[02:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8030.66s)]
*  date for sentencing and have recommendations on the sentencing and decide whether Diddy will be [[02:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8034.98s)]
*  free pending that sensing hearing out on bail, which he's not right now. Adding to what I just [[02:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8039.62s)]
*  said, guys, New York times also reporting that Deontay Nash, he was a witness in this case to [[02:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8046.58s)]
*  stylist and friend of Cassie's. He wrote a letter to the judge urging him not to release Sean [[02:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8050.9s)]
*  Combs in the wake of the mixed verdict. Prosecutors filed the letter along with their own, asking the [[02:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8056.179999999999s)]
*  judge not to give him bail pending sentencing. Nash, who testified that he had seen Combs beating [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8059.94s)]
*  Ms. Ventura, cited, quote, a long, well-documented history of violent, coercive and [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8065.139999999999s)]
*  retaliatory behavior and argued that Mr. Combs should stay in custody. Combs, Mr. Nash wrote, [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8069.7s)]
*  has repeatedly escaped meaningful accountability right on Deontay Nash. And if released on Wednesday, [[02:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8075.139999999999s)]
*  quote, I have no doubt he will see it as yet another license to continue intimidating, [[02:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8081.0599999999995s)]
*  threatening and harming people who challenge or expose him. What do you make of that, Matt? [[02:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8086.1s)]
*  Do these witness, and they're not testimonials, they're pleas, they're begging him not to release [[02:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8092.740000000001s)]
*  this guy pending the serving of a sentence. Will they have any sway with the judge? [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8099.14s)]
*  Well, they could. The problem, of course, is he wasn't convicted on any of the counts involving [[02:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8102.820000000001s)]
*  them, really. He was convicted on the Two Man Act violations, which is a, it's a very old law [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8109.14s)]
*  that, of course, just deals with transporting prostitutes over state lines, which, you know, [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8115.62s)]
*  a lot of lonely guys in New York City, whenever they get a hooker to come over one of those [[02:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8121.3s)]
*  bridges from New Jersey, they are technically also committing Man Act violations. So it's a, [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8127.3s)]
*  that's an old law back when morality was really something that the federal government would [[02:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8131.94s)]
*  attempt to enforce upon people. So it depends a little bit on that. But look, [[02:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8138.58s)]
*  remember, again, when one of the reasons why all the previous attempts at bail were rejected by [[02:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8145.0599999999995s)]
*  this judge is that Diddy, while in custody, was barring other inmates' calling numbers, [[02:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8152.26s)]
*  and the allegation from the prosecution was he was actually attempting to intimidate witnesses [[02:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8157.3s)]
*  from the jail. I think that could weigh in. I think it's also, if he is going to give him time [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8161.86s)]
*  for Man Act violations, you know, he'll probably keep them in. But if his intent is to give him [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8167.7s)]
*  credit time served for that, because they really are the least- [[02:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8176.34s)]
*  You really think he might not get time? [[02:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8180.66s)]
*  The least offensive of anything he was charged with, he could potentially release them. I don't [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8181.62s)]
*  disagree with anything that Phil just said, but it's, it'll be very telling, I think. If he [[02:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8186.74s)]
*  releases them on bond, it means he's probably not intending on sentencing them to any more time. [[02:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8192.9s)]
*  Wow. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8197.38s)]
*  Which could be one of the outcomes here. [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8197.46s)]
*  Yeah, that was- [[02:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8199.699999999999s)]
*  Can I ask you about that? Because there is also a theory that the Man Act could get [[02:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8200.259999999998s)]
*  ruled invalid, that there could be an appeal on that statute itself, which was originally, [[02:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8204.42s)]
*  I guess, passed to capture black men who were pimping out white women, and there's a racial [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8211.539999999999s)]
*  element to it. And, you know, they did play the race card with this jury. You know, that's the [[02:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8217.779999999999s)]
*  first thing they said when they stood up there. This is a black man. What has he ever done? They [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8223.46s)]
*  implicated during the course of the trial that the prosecutors brought the charges. For what reason? [[02:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8228.179999999998s)]
*  Why him? And the judge tried to shut that down, but that horse had already left the barn. So there's [[02:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8232.82s)]
*  a real, you know, there's a question about whether Diddy's lawyers are going to appeal that conviction, [[02:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8237.46s)]
*  saying it's a racist statute, it's outdated, it should be overturned. I don't know. There's- [[02:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8242.339999999998s)]
*  Do you think they have a leg to stand on there, Matt? [[02:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8248.019999999999s)]
*  I mean, look, it's a sad state of our current world, Megan, and I think you agree with me, [[02:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8249.7s)]
*  where race is injected to friggin' everything. I think it is an old law, but I don't think- I really- [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8256.5s)]
*  it just makes my skin crawl when you're talking about making a racial argument on that. I don't [[02:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8264.66s)]
*  think it gets reversed on that. It might get- you know, the Man Act, it's the law, and I don't think [[02:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8270.1s)]
*  that it's going to get reversed because of this case, but it is- it's a moral law, it is arguably [[02:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8276.82s)]
*  outdated, but it is still currently the law. It's on the books. Okay, wait, now I want to switch. [[02:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8285.46s)]
*  I want to keep going on this because now I've had a little time to think about what happened here, [[02:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8290.82s)]
*  and I got a lot of thoughts. I mean, my friend said- why? Like, my friend was texting me, [[02:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8295.86s)]
*  she's been watching, like, why did this happen? And I have to say, I do think there's a [[02:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8302.02s)]
*  multitude of answers, but one of them is celebrity, privilege, money, and the race element. [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8306.82s)]
*  They did play the race card, and there had been criticism of, like, the prosecutors for being too [[02:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8317.699999999999s)]
*  white. There was an analyst, a legal analyst at MSNBC who was raising this point. We cut it, [[02:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8323.94s)]
*  I'll play it, watch. Well, and also there are some racial dynamics here, Ana, that were at play, [[02:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8331.22s)]
*  and I think both the gender and the racial dynamics are worth talking about. [[02:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8335.94s)]
*  Earlier this spring, I went to cover an unrelated event down near the federal courthouses when I was [[02:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8340.02s)]
*  there on May 1st when I saw all six of the prosecutors on this team walk from their office, [[02:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8345.380000000001s)]
*  which is now at the Court of International Trade, to the courtroom itself. And they filed in a [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8351.62s)]
*  single file line, and they are all white women to a person, six of them, and they almost look like [[02:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8357.060000000001s)]
*  lawyer Barbies proceeding as they were walking to the court. It's not lost on me that particularly [[02:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8364.1s)]
*  given who the defendant was, and in a jury that not only was mixed by gender, but had from my [[02:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8370.1s)]
*  count at least seven people of color on it, that that dynamic may not have gone over particularly [[02:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8377.220000000001s)]
*  well with them. You can't say she's wrong. I mean, in New York City, the race of the defendant, [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8384.1s)]
*  the race of all the prosecutors, I don't agree with any of that. I mean, I think it's outrageous. [[02:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8392.58s)]
*  You can have a white woman prosecute a black man. That's just fine. By the way, black men got the [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8396.74s)]
*  right to vote before white women did. If we want to have a battle of oppression, which is what the [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8402.42s)]
*  left wants to do. In any event, maybe that was a factor, because I just can't believe that if you [[02:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8407.22s)]
*  had Phil Holloway sitting there with all that proof against a Phil Holloway, this would have [[02:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8414.58s)]
*  been the result, Phil. Well, you know, over at MSNBC, and on the left in general, their obsession [[02:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8419.7s)]
*  with race and gender is quite frankly very tiresome now. It has been for some time. Now, [[02:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8426.740000000002s)]
*  whether or not race or gender played a part in the jury's verdict, maybe. And that's a question [[02:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8434.5s)]
*  that the jurors themselves might have to answer. You know, we heard some, I think, truth come out [[02:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8441.060000000001s)]
*  of some jurors after the OJ trial that decided, you know, look, we said we weren't going to convict [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8446.18s)]
*  a black man. So race did bleed over into that high profile case. Maybe it had something to do with [[02:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8452.98s)]
*  this, although this was a mixed verdict. Look, this whole thing about Diddy and his danger to the [[02:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8459.300000000001s)]
*  community, all of that still exists. And this judge would be well served to remember that. [[02:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8470.02s)]
*  The judge is entitled and should remember all of the testimony and all of the evidence from the [[02:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8477.94s)]
*  trial, even things that went to the charges for which he was acquitted, because that should [[02:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8482.58s)]
*  inform the judge's decision about what to do next. That's okay. By that I mean- [[02:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8488.34s)]
*  For him to consider that? I'm sorry? [[02:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8492.02s)]
*  My question is, that's okay for the judge to consider evidence that was introduced at trial, [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8496.26s)]
*  even if he wasn't convicted of those counts? Like if the judge, you know, he heard evidence that he [[02:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8500.18s)]
*  committed arson against Kid Cudi's car, but the jury, they didn't really issue a direct finding [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8505.54s)]
*  on that because they may have thought he did that, but didn't do another thing that would have created [[02:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8510.660000000002s)]
*  a RICO charge. But can the judge factor in all of the terrible evidence against him that appears to [[02:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8514.5s)]
*  have been disregarded by the jury when he imposes sentence, Matt? [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8520.1s)]
*  Well, as they say, the only entity more powerful than a federal judge is God, right, in the United [[02:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8524.18s)]
*  States. And that's something to hear in law school. So a judge can consider anything he wants. What [[02:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8531.140000000001s)]
*  he makes a record of gets a little bit more dicey. But if I could just go back to that previous [[02:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8536.26s)]
*  question, you know, I prosecuted a lot of, I mean, sort of the United Colors and Benetton over the [[02:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8541.140000000001s)]
*  course of my career. I hope I don't offend anybody by saying that. But I mean, in Southern [[02:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8548.18s)]
*  California, you have a very diverse jury pool, contrary to popular opinion. Orange County is very [[02:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8552.9s)]
*  diverse. And, you know, the idea MSNBC, I don't know who that woman was that was talking. I don't [[02:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8558.9s)]
*  think that she's ever prosecuted a case. She certainly hasn't prosecuted a serious one that [[02:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8565.300000000001s)]
*  I'm aware of. And, you know, if her theory was right, Christopher Darden would have convicted OJ [[02:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8570.02s)]
*  with all the evidence they had, or Terry White would have convicted the police officers that [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8574.9s)]
*  beat Rodney King. So I think what really came in here, Megan, was that you can't when you're [[02:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8580.58s)]
*  talking about professorial presentation, and I thought they did a decent job of laying out the [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8588.9s)]
*  law, you keep the personality and the skill and the talent of the actual trial lawyers in a case [[02:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8594.82s)]
*  like that does matter. And when you have one that's personable and cracking jokes that the [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8602.34s)]
*  jury is relating to, the defense lawyer here that gave the closing was also white. So I reject her [[02:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8606.5s)]
*  comments on that wholly. And I've had plenty of people of color. I've had people of color in every [[02:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8611.94s)]
*  jury I've ever done of the 133 jury trials I did. And that's just like, that's sort of your typical [[02:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8617.380000000001s)]
*  MSNBC nonsense. By the way, most of the witnesses against Sean Combs were people of color. They were [[02:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8622.66s)]
*  black, or they were Asian or both. I mean, that's just that when you see everything through a lot [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8629.06s)]
*  of race, it doesn't surprise me that she's criticizing. And by the way, calling them, [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8634.58s)]
*  calling those women saying they look like a bunch of Barbies is a pejorative that a lot of women [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8639.619999999999s)]
*  should be offended by those women. They didn't bring it home. They got them on two counts. [[02:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8644.26s)]
*  To their credit, they took a run at a very famous, very wealthy guy. And to throw them [[02:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8651.859999999999s)]
*  under the bus there, it's a bunch of Barbies. I thought race was supposed to be bad, MSNBC. [[02:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8658.1s)]
*  Not so much that we're supposed to support women. [[02:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8664.34s)]
*  Well, you know what the real sin is. I don't actually know what they look like, but if they [[02:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8665.300000000001s)]
*  were attractive, I can see why this woman making the comment didn't like them. I'll leave it at [[02:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8668.66s)]
*  that. The Diddy defense has proposed the following bail package. A $1 million bond, co-signed by Sean [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8672.82s)]
*  Combs, his mother, his sister, and the mother of his oldest daughter. Mr. Combs' travel will be [[02:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8679.62s)]
*  restricted to the Southern District of Florida, Central District of California, and the Southern [[02:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8685.3s)]
*  District of New York to attend court, as well as the Eastern District of New York and the District [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8688.74s)]
*  of New Jersey, only to the extent that his travel to and from New York involves an airport in those [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8693.06s)]
*  districts. He's got to fly private. Let's not forget. Mr. Combs' passport will be surrendered. [[02:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8698.34s)]
*  Drug testing is ordered. All other standard conditions of pretrial supervision. That's his [[02:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8703.14s)]
*  proposal. I just want you to know, as you consider that, Phil Holloway, that here's the sketch artist [[02:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8708.34s)]
*  rendering of Diddy after he had learned the verdict, literally on his knees, praying on his chair. [[02:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8714.26s)]
*  This is what the judge allowed to happen in his courtroom, praying to God, with whom I'm sure he [[02:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8723.14s)]
*  has a really tight relationship. I'm sure he's super tight with God. You brought the Bible in [[02:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8728.66s)]
*  there every day just to remind us what a God-fearing man he is. As his supporters [[02:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8733.78s)]
*  are outside, actually we have a sock cut of it. There's one woman. People are chanting around her, [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8739.220000000001s)]
*  it's not Rico, it's Freako. And here's the woman. Let's watch it and I'll explain what we're seeing. [[02:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8745.460000000001s)]
*  I don't know what she's gonna do, y'all. [[02:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8752.66s)]
*  She's jumping with very large breasts and spraying baby oil on herself and others. [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8757.78s)]
*  She's wearing a bright blue wig. She took the wig off. She's wearing next to nothing. She's [[02:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8767.380000000001s)]
*  shaking her breasts and pouring baby oil on herself. I'm sorry, but this is what the prosecutors were [[02:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8772.26s)]
*  up against. Well, I mean, if that's what's on the jury, no wonder they lost that. [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8777.94s)]
*  You know, we don't know. I don't know that that's on the jury. The jury's anonymous to us other than [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8783.460000000001s)]
*  random descriptions. I don't know. [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8787.78s)]
*  And that is juror number 25. That's... [[02:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8793.220000000001s)]
*  We can have another entire show discussing how people should comport themselves in public or [[02:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8799.78s)]
*  certainly in courtrooms. And I don't know where things went wrong, but I know that that's not it. [[02:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8805.86s)]
*  Okay, that's not okay. But the judge to allow some of the outbursts and things like that, [[02:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8811.86s)]
*  that we saw take place in the courtroom, you know, that's a head scratcher. [[02:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8816.900000000001s)]
*  This is going on outside the courtroom. That's, you know, sadly, that's not so much of a head [[02:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8823.460000000001s)]
*  scratcher for me. I can kind of... I'm not surprised at all one bit that that's... [[02:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8828.42s)]
*  It just shows you the power of celebrity and money. And I don't think he's going to change [[02:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8833.14s)]
*  one bit. In fact, this is one comfort I have in the wake of Diddy's acquittal on the most serious [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8840.1s)]
*  charges. Here's my one comfort. Much in the same way I feel like the most serious counts against [[02:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8845.779999999999s)]
*  him were nullified by his fame and his celebrity. They had to find him guilty on the transportation [[02:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8850.98s)]
*  of prostitutes. It was so obvious. It would have been so obvious if they had not found him guilty [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8855.46s)]
*  on those, that they were just in the bag for him. But the reason I think he got off largely was, [[02:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8859.86s)]
*  I think they were dazzled. I do. I think they were dazzled by his celebrity, his power, his money, [[02:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8865.54s)]
*  just like he dazzled everybody who took the witness stand. And they all talked about that, [[02:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8870.980000000001s)]
*  how he cast a spell on them. He was a godlike figure. And that's sadly how a lot of Americans [[02:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8875.300000000001s)]
*  are when it comes to super powerful, super wealthy, super famous people. But the same was true of OJ [[02:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8880.900000000001s)]
*  Simpson. And I believe that just like OJ Simpson, a man who's engaged in this many crimes for this [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8887.14s)]
*  long a time, like Sean Combs, is not going to stop. He feels more emboldened and empowered to violate [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8894.5s)]
*  the law with impunity than ever now. And I give him seven years at the outset before he gets arrested [[02:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8902.26s)]
*  again on a charge that will be a lot more difficult to weasel out of. And the next time he beats [[02:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8909.06s)]
*  somebody up in the middle of a hotel room, I think you're going to have a court room, a hotel [[02:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8915.94s)]
*  clerk who's a lot more reluctant to hide the tape and not call the cops than those [[02:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8920.980000000001s)]
*  disgraced security guards at the hotel Intercontinental were. A place I don't even [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8929.060000000001s)]
*  want to stay anymore, having learned that they took the payoff to hide the tape. So I think Diddy is [[02:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8934.26s)]
*  his own worst enemy. And he will make the bed that he will wind up lying in for most of his adult life, [[02:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8938.9s)]
*  I predict. And it will be in a prison cell, not even related to this case. So we'll see. [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8944.9s)]
*  Guys, you've done more than your fair share of time on the MK show today. Thank you both so much [[02:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8950.34s)]
*  for your expertise. Thank you. I need to go bleach my eyes now after that last video. Thank you. [[02:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8955.38s)]
*  She'll show up at the next party if she's invited. No doubt. She'll be there. She's ready to go. [[02:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8961.3s)]
*  All she needs is the astro. Thank you. Wow. What a day. What a day for all of you, too. Thank you. [[02:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1HZs0wDPQPE&t=8966.66s)]
