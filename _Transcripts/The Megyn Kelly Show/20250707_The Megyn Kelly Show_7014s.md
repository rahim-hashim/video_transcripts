Video Description: Megyn Kelly begins the show by breaking down the deadly and tragic Texas floods that killed at least 82 people, including young girls at Camp Mystic, heroic stories of rescues, the rush by some to politicize the story and blame Trump and DOGE, and more. Then Andrew Klavan, host of The Daily Wire's "Andrew Klavan Show," joins to discuss the media and leftists trying to politicize the Texas flood tragedy, the truth about the amount of warnings that came before the natural disaster struck, how warning fatigue may have delayed the response, disturbing reactions from some on the left cheering the deaths of the young girls in Texas, what it reveals about moral decay in American culture, the DOJ and FBI's shocking announcement that there is no Epstein client list and no further disclosures will be coming, the past comments from AG Pam Bondi and others in the Trump administration, what this says about powerful people in America and conspiracy theories, and more. Then Salena Zito, author of "Butler," joins to share her firsthand account of being just feet away from President Trump at the assassination attempt in Pennsylvania, the chilling moment Trump turned his head just before the bullet was fired, the bond Trump has with his supporters, her duty to keep reporting through the chaos, how Trump called her seven times after the assassination attempt to check on her and her family, the powerful message of “fight, fight, fight” and what Trump told her about why he said it, how the moment marked a spiritual shift in how he views his life and presidency, and more.

# Ghouls Blame Texas Flooding on Trump, Shock Epstein News, & Butler Secrets, w/ Klavan & Salena Zito
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [July 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Another massive news day as we begin the week. Wow. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=0.0s)]
*  We'll get to Texas in one second, but just first, the DOJ and the FBI have reportedly concluded their investigations now into the death of Jeffrey Epstein [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7.0s)]
*  and have found, they say, that there is no evidence Jeffrey Epstein blackmailed powerful figures, kept a so-called client list, or that he was murdered. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=18.0s)]
*  Needless to say, although I guess we shouldn't say that, it is needful to say, that those conclusions have opened up a whole new line of questions. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=31.0s)]
*  And I've got to add, it's totally predictable. And I'm just, here's my headline. With all due respect, I like her, but I blame Pam Bondi for this. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=41.0s)]
*  She has said all sorts of things and created big events at the White House. Like, here it is. And then blame the FBI. Oh, there's more. And I'll get it. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=52.0s)]
*  And now today we get a joint announcement, DOJ, FBI, there's nothing. You're on camera saying you have something. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=63.0s)]
*  Like, this is not the fault of the so-called conspiracy theorists. We've been led down a path, yes, in part due to the armchair information analysts for years now, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=71.0s)]
*  but this DOJ told us that we'd be getting a lot more. Pam Bondi, Alina Habba, went on Piers Morgan, made a bunch. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=83.0s)]
*  Like, we're going to get into it. All right. But we are going to start with new information on the awful tragedy unfolding in Texas. My God. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=92.0s)]
*  It's a nightmare. If you listened to our AM Update show, you know that five young campers were confirmed dead over the weekend after flooding hit Camp Mystic. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=102.0s)]
*  The campsite hit hard during the storm. At around 9 a.m. this morning, the camp put out a statement that reads, in part, Camp Mystic is grieving the loss of 27 campers and counselors following the catastrophic flooding on the Guadalupe River. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=112.0s)]
*  And I feel sad for the counselors, too. You start to read up on them. They were just teenagers themselves. The counselors are just high school girls. And the campers were eight, nine-year-old little girls. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=128.0s)]
*  I mean, but none of these was even an adult. 27 lost with almost no chance, almost no chance to live whatsoever the way this river moved in. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=139.0s)]
*  It's unclear exactly what number of the 27 are which, you know, the very young children and the teenage counselors. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=152.0s)]
*  But it just doesn't matter. Thinking of the terror that those sweet souls felt. It happened overnight. One minute tucked in their beds in their nightgowns at sleepaway camp, completely joyful by all accounts. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=160.0s)]
*  The girls love this camp. And the next, a wall of rushing cold water in the total darkness of night. This is the aftermath of what happened at Camp Mystic. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=172.0s)]
*  Oh, for the listening audience, you're going to see the beds inside the cabins. This is an all-girls camp that's been around for nearly 100 years. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=185.0s)]
*  Here you see rows of bunk beds thrown about, covered in mud, left behind when the waters finally receded. Pink and purple blankets, stuffed animals, all stuff your little girl probably has. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=196.0s)]
*  Fans, photos taped to the walls, stuff they packed for what was supposed to be a normal week of camping with new and old friends and horseback riding and Bible reading. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=208.0s)]
*  These were Christians. It was a Christian camp. The cabins for the youngest campers sat less than a football field away from the Guadalupe River, which rose several feet in just minutes. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=220.0s)]
*  They said normally it was around one foot and went up to over 34. Among the girls lost was Renee Sumastrila. She was nine years old. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=232.0s)]
*  Sumastrila. Her uncle wrote on social media, we are thankful she was with her friends and having the time of her life as evidenced by this picture from yesterday, the day before she died. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=247.0s)]
*  She will forever be lying in her, she will forever be living her best life at Camp Mystic. Lila Bonner and Eloise Peck were best friends and campmates too. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=257.0s)]
*  Here's a picture of the two of them, arms around each other's shoulders hugging. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=268.0s)]
*  Eloise's mother writing on Facebook, Eloise was literally friends with everyone. She loves spaghetti, but not more than she loved dogs and animals. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=272.0s)]
*  She passed away with her cabin mate and best friend Lila Bonner, who also died. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=280.0s)]
*  Eloise had a family who loved her fiercely for the eight years she was with us, especially her mommy. Oh my God, it's awful. It's just so awful. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=286.0s)]
*  The loss of life was not just at Camp Mystic. The death toll continues to rise by the hour. As of noon Eastern on Monday, it stands at 82 people dead, but it will climb. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=297.0s)]
*  Sisters Blair and Brooke Harbor also lost their lives. They were just 11 and 13. They were staying with their grandparents in a cabin along the same river, their grandparents still unaccounted for. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=308.0s)]
*  A family member said the bodies of Blair and Brooke were later found 15 miles away from the campsite with their hands locked together. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=321.0s)]
*  If you don't live near a river, it's sometimes hard to imagine just how quickly they can rise. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=329.0s)]
*  But this next video shows what people in Kerr County, Texas and surrounding areas were up against. It was taken by Gavin Walton near Center Point, Texas, and he shared it with us. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=335.0s)]
*  Gavin tells us he took the video just after 7 a.m. on July 4th. Remember this happened largely overnight Thursday to Friday. Look at this. He was standing on a bridge. This is downriver from Camp Mystic. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=345.0s)]
*  You can see the Guadalupe Riverbed is almost dry with little water in it, and then a rush of water quickly surges from around the corner. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=355.0s)]
*  I've seen so many videos of this online where it's dry. It's a regular road, and the next minute it's a raging river. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=364.0s)]
*  This next video was taken just five minutes later on the very same bridge. The water is now filled with debris, easily taking down nearby trees. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=372.0s)]
*  It's uprooting old trees, root and branch. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=382.0s)]
*  This video was taken 17 minutes after the first rush of water. Now you see the water has not only risen several feet, but has picked up speed too. Speed and force. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=388.0s)]
*  That would be nearly impossible for a youngster or even an adult to withstand. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=398.0s)]
*  This video taken 33 minutes in. The water is now almost as high as the bridge. Tree branches, garbage, pieces of decks from nearby homes crashing into the bridge. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=405.0s)]
*  And wait until you see what happens next as Gavin records an entire home comes into the frame and eventually slams into the bridge. My God. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=415.0s)]
*  In a matter of just a few hours, the river rising from one to 34 feet. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=425.0s)]
*  President Trump is expected to travel to see the damage himself on Friday, saying he would go today if he could, but he doesn't want to get in the way of rescue operations. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=432.0s)]
*  Some in the media, absolute ghouls all over the Internet trying to blame the president and doge for the tragedy, claiming cuts by doge to the National Weather Service are to blame that they left the agency unprepared. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=440.0s)]
*  There's a long list of disgusting political ghouls who are doing this. They're insane. These are insane people. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=455.0s)]
*  They're literally saying that these people deserved it, that these sweet little eight year old girls, that the 11 and 13 year old girls with their arms around each other, that they deserved it because it's a Republican state and they must have voted for Trump and Elon. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=466.0s)]
*  So suck it. It's absolutely disgusting. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=483.0s)]
*  Again, there's a long list. We're going to go over it, but take a listen to ABC News' George Stephanopoulos. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=488.0s)]
*  Fresh off of settling a 16 million defamation lawsuit for lies, he told, over and over and over. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=496.0s)]
*  He's an on-camera paid liar, still finding ways to lie about Donald Trump, who he says is to blame for everything. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=504.0s)]
*  Maria, we're also learning that there were significant staffing shortfalls of the National Weather Service's offices in the region. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=515.0s)]
*  You know, George, as of right now, the local county officials really didn't want to address that just yet. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=524.0s)]
*  Okay. He wants you to know that there were shortages at the National Weather Service. What is the relevant question? [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=532.0s)]
*  Were there shortages in the office that was responsible for this region? [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=539.0s)]
*  Did anybody involved at that office say the problem was we were understaffed? We needed more bodies. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=544.0s)]
*  To the contrary, they had extra staff on board in that office going into this event. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=551.0s)]
*  They understood that they were in a very precarious situation. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=559.0s)]
*  They brought on more than double the normal expected staff that night. [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=563.0s)]
*  And not one of them is saying that this was the result of Doge cuts. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=568.0s)]
*  I missed that in George's toss to his reporter on the scene. Great job. Great job informing your ABC News audience. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=574.0s)]
*  Who you also misled, by the way, your colleagues at their presidential debate between Kamala Harris and Donald Trump on the subject of Venezuelan gangs out in Aurora, Colorado. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=582.0s)]
*  Remember when ABC News tried to tee up Donald Trump on that and Trump took it and said, this is what's happening with these gang members? [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=596.0s)]
*  Well, now even the left wing media is admitting Trump was right about that. But ABC News doesn't get it. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=603.0s)]
*  If it means Trump was right or Trump didn't do something terrible, they're not interested, you see, because our media won't respect the dead. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=610.0s)]
*  Some of which are still floating in the Guadalupe River. They're too focused on bringing down orange man bad. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=621.0s)]
*  They're sick. These are sick people we're dealing with. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=629.0s)]
*  They're on the left and they're all over the media. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=633.0s)]
*  It's just reached the same epic flood proportions of that very river where it's almost too strong and overwhelming to really handle, to really get your arms around all of them. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=637.0s)]
*  Joining me now on an important day, Andrew Klavan, host of the Andrew Klavan show for The Daily Wire. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=652.0s)]
*  Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=658.0s)]
*  Since President Trump was sworn in, his administration has made enormous progress at a breakneck pace. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=665.0s)]
*  But don't forget, while they're moving mountains for the good of the nation, you've got your own personal savings to worry about. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=671.0s)]
*  And one of the best ways to look after your savings is through diversification, particularly with gold, like from Birch Gold Group. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=676.0s)]
*  In the past 12 months, the value of gold has increased by 40 percent. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=683.0s)]
*  OMG. Central banks continue to bolster demand for gold by buying in record quantities. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=689.0s)]
*  Global instability and tension is high, and Birch Gold makes owning physical gold extremely easy. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=695.0s)]
*  Easily convert an existing IRA or 401k into a tax sheltered IRA in physical gold, or buy some to store in your home safe. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=701.0s)]
*  Just text MK to the number 989898 and Birch Gold will send you a free info kit on gold. [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=710.0s)]

*  With an A-plus rating from the Better Business Bureau and tens of thousands of happy customers, take control of your savings today. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=719.0s)]
*  Text MK to the number 989898. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=725.0s)]
*  Andrew, thank you so much for being here today. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=729.0s)]
*  I'm horrified by the events, horrible weather events happen in the United States and elsewhere. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=731.0s)]
*  There's not a ton we can do about in all circumstances. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=739.0s)]
*  You know, we have a better chance of predicting sometimes earthquakes, sometimes hurricanes in particular. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=742.0s)]
*  Flash flooding seems to be a problem for us. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=749.0s)]
*  They can predict big rains, and in this particular circumstance, unfortunately, the big rains met very, very dry ground, which I initially thought would be better. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=752.0s)]
*  But no, I've since learned it's worse because I guess slightly wetter ground can absorb the water better. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=764.0s)]
*  It's just more absorbent, whereas dry, dry land like they were seeing in Texas, they said it's like concrete. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=770.0s)]
*  So nothing gets absorbed and the flash floods can quickly turn a river into what's more like an ocean raging through, you know, campgrounds. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=777.0s)]
*  But I cannot believe the ghouls, again, on the left and in the media, who think the most important thing right now is to make sure Trump gets blamed. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=785.0s)]
*  Your thoughts? [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=795.0s)]
*  It's a profound. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=796.0s)]
*  It's a profound evil because it's a profound tragedy. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=797.0s)]
*  I have a lot of experience with rivers. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=800.0s)]
*  I'm a lifetime fisherman and rafter, and you cannot you cannot describe the power that a river has, even at a low level, the way it can reduce you instantaneously to helplessness, the way it can carry you off as if you were nothing, as if you were a twig just being carried away on the tide. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=802.0s)]
*  These tragedies are going to happen. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=819.0s)]
*  They always have happened and they're going to continue to happen. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=821.0s)]
*  And they're really, really hard for the human heart to encompass, you know, especially maybe maybe especially if you have faith and you want to trust in God. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=823.0s)]
*  These are the moments that try that that faith that try that trust, because it's hard to understand why these things happen in the world. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=833.0s)]
*  It's just it's just incomprehensible. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=840.0s)]
*  And the human heart can't handle it. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=842.0s)]
*  There's always an urge to look for someone to blame or something to blame, something that could have been fixed, something that could have prevented it. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=844.0s)]
*  And there's always something that you can find that people did wrong because people always are imperfect and they always do things wrong. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=850.0s)]
*  And nobody, nobody can come up with an answer to the power of nature. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=856.0s)]
*  It's just something that is beyond us to take advantage of that absence, to take advantage of that emptiness that we feel that need to find some kind of make some kind of sense out of what doesn't make sense to find some kind of soft place to land in this tragedy. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=860.0s)]
*  To sell your particular political point of view is actually wicked to the point of evil. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=875.0s)]
*  You know, evil is a word I don't like to use, but you can't help. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=881.0s)]
*  But when you look at a guy like George Stephanopoulos, who was hired for his place at ABC solely from his experience of silencing women who said they had been abused by Bill Clinton, who has remained at that level of morality throughout his reporting career, as far as I'm concerned, to stoop to that level. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=884.0s)]
*  Dana Bash did it too at CNN. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=903.0s)]
*  You just you wonder at the hollowness of them. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=906.0s)]
*  You wonder at the fact that they're not thinking about the fact that there are parents out there who have lost their children, which is the worst thing that can happen to you in human life. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=908.0s)]
*  That is the single worst thing that can happen. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=917.0s)]
*  They're going to take advantage of that to sell their petty politics at some point, at some point in most human beings hearts. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=920.0s)]
*  You know, left and right. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=927.0s)]
*  At some point, there's a point when you stop and you just say, you know, we just have to bow our heads. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=929.0s)]
*  We have to bow our heads. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=934.0s)]
*  We have to try to look for faith. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=935.0s)]
*  We have to try to look for trust and try to encompass these things that happen and have always happened. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=937.0s)]
*  And in my opinion, will always happen. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=942.0s)]
*  There's only when when paradise comes, maybe this will stop. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=944.0s)]
*  But for now in human life, this is going to be a part of life. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=948.0s)]
*  And to take advantage of that, whether it's a school shooting or or some kind of other act of human evil or just this really which is more comprehensible than these natural events that take people we love away and as you say, take these the most helpless and most beautiful and most beloved among us away to take advantage of that for your political purposes is just as base as it's possible to be. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=951.0s)]
*  I can't understand it exactly. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=974.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=977.0s)]
*  Except to say that if you find yourself doing something like that because of your political philosophy, change your political philosophy. [[00:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=978.0s)]
*  It's time to really repent and turn your mind around in another direction. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=983.0s)]
*  This is this is what tragedy is like. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=988.0s)]
*  You know, it really does bring out people's characters. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=990.0s)]
*  And I think the people who run these news media outlets should take a look at the characters that have been exposed and do something about it. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=992.0s)]
*  Yeah, I totally agree. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1000.0s)]
*  I think it's just look, if there were clear evidence, you know, if it emerged immediately thereafter that the local National Weather Service guys were understaffed, they only had one guy on duty where they used to have 10 and that guy couldn't handle it. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1002.0s)]
*  And that's OK. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1014.0s)]
*  We would deal with that. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1015.0s)]
*  You know, we would deal with that after we had a moment to mourn the loss of these innocents. [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1016.0s)]
*  However, the information is exactly the opposite. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1022.0s)]
*  What we know now is that the National Weather Service is going to walk you through it provided over 12 hours of advance notice via the flood watch and over three hours of lead time for flash flood warnings with escalated alerts as the storm intensified. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1026.0s)]
*  The main problem seems to have been it all happened overnight. [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1041.0s)]
*  And most people were asleep and really not paying that close attention. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1045.0s)]
*  And I've heard some locals down there say something which rings very true, which is there's also flash flood fatigue warning fatigue. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1048.0s)]
*  And you get this in any area that is, you know, Tornado Alley down in I think it's in Oklahoma, that particular area, or places where they have, you know, lots of warnings when there's big storms in the winter, whatever. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1057.0s)]
*  People get used to them and they're like, I'm not leaving. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1070.0s)]
*  I'm not evacuating. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1073.0s)]
*  I'm sick of these big warnings. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1074.0s)]
*  Happens in Florida with the hurricanes. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1075.0s)]
*  And there's probably a fair amount of people in this region who get flash flood warnings a lot and are like, eh, because maybe they're already overused. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1077.0s)]
*  I don't know, you know, because that can happen too where you're like, they're just covering their own butts. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1086.0s)]
*  It's not real. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1090.0s)]
*  And I'm not evacuating, you know, my family or a whole camp of youngsters for this. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1091.0s)]
*  But you do that at your risk and at the risk of the people you love or are charged with caring for. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1096.0s)]
*  So just to keep going. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1102.0s)]
*  And by the way, I do not have any information that the folks at Camp Mystic actively ignored warnings. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1103.0s)]
*  I don't know what happened there, but I would like to know. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1108.0s)]
*  OK, so there was over 12 hours of advance notice with a flood watch, three hours of lead time for flood warnings, which is an escalation, and then escalated alerts beyond just a warning, like warnings with emergencies attached to them as they got closer to the actual floods and the storms were intensifying. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1111.0s)]
*  So this is overnight the day before. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1131.0s)]
*  So July, July 4th is Friday. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1134.0s)]
*  On the morning of July 3rd, the National Weather Center issued a flood hazard outlook identifying flash flooding potential for Kerrville and surrounding areas, which is the relevant area. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1136.0s)]
*  One eighteen p.m. on July 3rd. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1146.0s)]
*  That's Thursday. [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1148.0s)]
*  They issued a flood watch for Kerr County effective through Friday. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1149.0s)]
*  Six twenty two p.m. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1152.0s)]
*  July 3rd, National Weather Center warns of considerable flooding risks north and west of San Antonio, including Kerrville. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1153.0s)]
*  Eleven forty one p.m. [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1162.0s)]
*  Now. Now it's about to start really happening Thursday night into Friday, July 3rd. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1164.0s)]
*  First flash flood warning issued for Bandera County, which is right next to one fourteen a.m. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1168.0s)]
*  Now we're on July 4th, the wee hours flash flood warning with considerable tag issued for Bandera and Kerr Counties triggering wireless emergency alerts and Noah Weather Radio notifications. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1174.0s)]
*  Now, a lot of the phones didn't have service, I guess, historically in this area. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1186.0s)]
*  It's tough to get cell phone service. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1190.0s)]
*  So the locals who really do care will get a Noah, Noah Weather Radio. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1191.0s)]
*  Radio and that that stuff works. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1197.0s)]
*  But query who was listening to their Noah Weather Radio that night as they went to bed. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1199.0s)]
*  You know, I would argue, look, I don't know what happened at Camp Mystic, but I would argue they had an obligation to have that radio, to have somebody awake and to have somebody listening. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1205.0s)]
*  And I'm sorry, I know I've only heard lovely things about the people who ran the camp, but those eight year old girls should have been removed from that obviously endangered cabin when there was the first notification and moved to higher ground. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1213.0s)]
*  I realize hindsight is twenty twenty. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1226.0s)]
*  I'm not saying it in a nasty way. [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1228.0s)]
*  I'm saying these are things we needed to learn that you got to listen, even if it's a pain in the ass to move the kids. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1230.0s)]
*  And just a couple more for you. [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1235.0s)]
*  Four oh three a.m. [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1236.0s)]
*  July 4th flash flood warning upgraded to flash flood emergency for Kerr County, including Hunt at five a.m. [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1237.0s)]
*  July 4th National Weather Center warns of widespread, considerable and catastrophic flooding. [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1245.0s)]
*  And on top of all that, the Associated Press reports the National Weather Service Office in New Braunfels, which delivers forecasts for this region, had extra staff on duty during the storms, according to Jason Runyon, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service, where the office would typically have two forecasters on duty during clear weather. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1251.0s)]
*  They had up to five on staff. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1268.0s)]
*  There were extra people here that night. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1270.0s)]
*  He said that's typical in every weather service office. [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1272.0s)]
*  You staff up for an event and you bring in people on overtime and hold them over. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1275.0s)]
*  None of that stopped the cretins, Andrew. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1279.0s)]
*  But it sounds like they did what you would expect normal humans to do in advance of this kind of tragedy. [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1282.0s)]
*  That's that is exactly the point. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1288.0s)]
*  Going back to what you said before, if you're at the weather service and you don't issue a warning, then somebody gets hurt. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1290.0s)]
*  That's on you. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1298.0s)]
*  So you're going to issue that warning. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1299.0s)]
*  But that means you're going to issue a lot of warnings that don't pan out. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1300.0s)]
*  And ultimately, people are going to get a new word to the warnings and they're not going to move every time they hear a warning because it would be insane to do that. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1303.0s)]
*  It would be insane to leave your house every time the weather service feels compelled to tell you to be careful. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1310.0s)]
*  So there's a built in human nature, a flaw in human nature where on the one hand, it's not cover your ass. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1315.0s)]
*  It's actually do the right thing. [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1321.0s)]
*  You issue the warnings, but a lot of them are not going to pan out so that eventually, on the other hand, people are not going to move. [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1323.0s)]
*  And as you say, a lot of this happened late at night. [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1329.0s)]
*  People were sleeping. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1331.0s)]
*  They were they had been told that maybe they wanted to install a siren. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1332.0s)]
*  And I'm sure they should have. [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1336.0s)]
*  And I'm sure at some point you're going to find out that somebody could have done something better because nobody ever does anything perfectly. [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1338.0s)]
*  And that's that's going to be part of the investigation and part of what comes out over time. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1344.0s)]
*  But the director of the camp died trying to rescue some of these people, some of these children. [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1348.0s)]
*  You can't you can't doubt the goodwill or the courage or the love that was on display. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1353.0s)]
*  The kids love this camp because of what it was, because of the love that was on display. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1358.0s)]
*  This is just it's just a tragedy. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1362.0s)]
*  That's what tragedy means. [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1365.0s)]
*  It's when something cannot be helped because it feeds into human nature and it feeds into nature itself. [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1366.0s)]
*  And again, I'm not saying that there shouldn't be improvements. [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1372.0s)]
*  I'm not saying there might not be somebody who did something wrong or was careless or reckless. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1375.0s)]
*  But at least at the beginning, I think it's time to mourn. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1379.0s)]
*  It's time to pray. [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1383.0s)]
*  It's time to hope that these that some people will still survive who are missing. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1384.0s)]
*  But and there will be time to do this investigation. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1389.0s)]
*  I understand that we live in a minute by minute news cycle, but still all the same. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1393.0s)]
*  I just I think it is one of my least favorite things about the American news media is the search to use tragedy to push forward an agenda. [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1398.0s)]
*  When the first thing should be to take in the scope of the tragedy, support the guys, the Coast Guard and the police and the first responders who are out there trying to rescue people. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1409.0s)]
*  That's that's the seems to be the first order of business. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1419.0s)]
*  And then, yes, we have to look into what went wrong and what can be made better without wrapping people in so much safety that they can't live. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1422.0s)]
*  There's always going to be room for tragedy. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1429.0s)]
*  There is always going to be room for even this kind of unimaginable terror and tragedy. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1431.0s)]
*  And I think that that's something that America just hasn't seemed to get used to. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1437.0s)]
*  You know, it hasn't seemed to be able to teach itself that, yes, at some point, sometimes you just bow your head and weep because that's the only thing you can do. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1442.0s)]
*  Again, there will be investigations. [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1449.0s)]
*  There may be things they find that can be improved, but it does not seem to me some kind of act of massive malfeasance by the government or by anybody else. [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1451.0s)]
*  It just seems the absolute power of nature to carry things away when it decides that that's what it's going to do. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1458.0s)]
*  Nature, the earth can, you know, as George Carlin once said, the earth can earth can shrug us off like a dog shrugs off fleas. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1465.0s)]
*  That's how powerful it is. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1472.0s)]
*  And that's what we were seeing witnessing in this flood. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1474.0s)]
*  I mean, I can't I too have heard only lovely stories about the guy who ran Camp Mystic and that he did. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1477.0s)]
*  He died. He gave his life trying to save those kids. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1485.0s)]
*  But I do I do have to wonder why would you put the most the youngest, most vulnerable, so close to the river when this river has flooded repeatedly? [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1487.0s)]
*  In the past, 10 teenagers were killed in 1987. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1494.0s)]
*  We pulled the news report. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1497.0s)]
*  It wasn't exactly at this area, but it was a couple of miles away. [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1499.0s)]
*  It wasn't it wasn't far away. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1501.0s)]
*  And it's just, you know, it's 20, 20 hindsight. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1503.0s)]
*  But the warnings were coming. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1505.0s)]
*  I mean, I just I'd like to think that a camp I went to or I sent my children to would have somebody awake and whose responsibility it is on a night where it's heavy downpours to be listening to that Noah Weather Radio and to be taking precautions because it was a known risk. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1507.0s)]
*  And as you point out, these rivers can quickly go from one foot and an absolute nothing to a raging ravine that looks more like a level five rapid that no one could be expected to survive with RV debris and tree debris coming into a girl's cabin. [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1521.0s)]
*  You know, it's just it's the risk is just so high. [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1539.0s)]
*  We have to learn more about exactly what went on there. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1542.0s)]
*  We actually pulled the news report. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1545.0s)]
*  It looks just like William Shatner doing this report tossing to this. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1547.0s)]
*  I'm not sure if that could be. [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1552.0s)]
*  Maybe he did a stint as in news for a time or maybe this guy is just a look alike. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1553.0s)]
*  But here is two from 1987 on Friday morning, July 17th, 1987, the small town of Comfort, Texas, became the scene of a heroic rescue and tragic loss. [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1557.0s)]
*  Much of the footage you will see was taped on that day by the banks of the Guadalupe River. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1568.0s)]
*  It was the day that was supposed to go home. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1573.0s)]
*  The more than 300 children at the church camp were awakened early. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1575.0s)]
*  The river was flooded. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1578.0s)]
*  If they didn't leave soon, their buses might not be able to leave at all. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1580.0s)]
*  We started going around the corner. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1584.0s)]
*  We want to go down the hill. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1586.0s)]
*  Then water started coming in a bus and stuff. [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1588.0s)]
*  We tried to back up. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1590.0s)]
*  But then the bus got stuck. [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1591.0s)]
*  So they made all of us get out of the bus. [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1592.0s)]
*  And that's whenever the first wave hit us and I'm start scattering people to different trees. [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1595.0s)]
*  Kids playing on the trees like ants surrounded by rushing water. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1604.0s)]
*  Masterman tried repeatedly to rescue 14 year old Melanie Finley, but she was ripped away by the river. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1611.0s)]
*  It's awful. [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1617.0s)]
*  You see these people floating in the river. [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1625.0s)]
*  We're seeing those scenes today. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1627.0s)]
*  It was William Shatner. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1628.0s)]
*  He hosted a show called Rescue 911 at the time. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1629.0s)]
*  So there's a history. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1632.0s)]
*  That wasn't the only time. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1634.0s)]
*  It's flooded repeatedly this river. [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1635.0s)]
*  There was some level of warning built in. [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1637.0s)]
*  I don't know that all the parents sending their kids to this camp were considering it. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1640.0s)]
*  But certainly if you're running the camp, I'm not blaming anybody. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1645.0s)]
*  I'm just saying these are definitely things that need to be looked into. [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1647.0s)]
*  But that's different from saying let's figure out how this happens so that we can build in protections at other camps where other kids are vulnerable. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1650.0s)]
*  Then what's happening with these just partisan hacks on the left in the media who immediately need to find a way to blame it on Trump or to see one of their other pet core projects or issues of their life confirmed like climate change. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1657.0s)]
*  You mentioned Dana Bash. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1672.0s)]
*  Here she is. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1673.0s)]
*  How much do you think the changing climate is part of what we are seeing go on here? [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1676.0s)]
*  Just talking about the federal government and even the local government, two Texas National Weather Service offices involved in forecasting and warning about flooding on the Guadalupe River are missing some key staff members. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1683.0s)]
*  A director of the NWS union told CNN that the Austin San Antonio office is missing a warning coordination meteorologist due to the Trump administration's buyouts. [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1698.0s)]
*  Right. And did she get to the part about how but the the area the office responsible for this area was overstaffed and hasn't made any complaints about missing key personnel in order to predict this tragedy, which it did. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1710.0s)]
*  There were also reports that the the Trump big beautiful bill, which hasn't gone into effect, had cut down on satellite reporting, which is also untrue. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1725.0s)]
*  There is some something in there about the DOD not wanting to use classified satellites for weather reporting, but had nothing to do with any of this. [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1736.0s)]
*  It's a sickness. It really is. [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1745.0s)]
*  I mean, it obviously look, it obviously should tell you that your philosophy is wrong, that something is wrong. [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1747.0s)]
*  If your politics, if my politics turned me into somebody who would do that, I would change my politics. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1753.0s)]
*  I would immediately say, what have I become? [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1759.0s)]
*  What have I done? [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1761.0s)]
*  That is the way you maintain some sort of decency in your life by checking your actions against some kind of moral measure. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1762.0s)]
*  But they've convinced themselves that this is morality, that standing up for climate change is some important thing to do, even while they build their mansions on the side of other rivers and other coastlines, saying those coastlines are going to overflow. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1770.0s)]
*  It really is a sickness. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1784.0s)]
*  And I really do believe this. [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1786.0s)]
*  I believe that we have gone into a period of mental illness in this country, of widespread mental illness, and some of it is being spread by the news media, but some of it is also being demonstrated by the news media. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1787.0s)]
*  How do you sleep at night when you do a report like that? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1796.0s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1799.0s)]
*  I really don't. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1800.0s)]
*  I mean, I think I understand that people's hearts get twisted. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1801.0s)]
*  I understand that people do evil things, but you're being paid a lot of money to actually live up to a certain standard of reporting. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1803.0s)]
*  Why is she bringing climate change into the right? [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1812.0s)]
*  Was it climate change in 1987 when I was 16 and a junior in high school? [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1815.0s)]
*  Was it that like, that was 40 years ago? [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1822.0s)]
*  Well, not quite, but almost like they ignore all this. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1824.0s)]
*  That's her pet issue making its way into her coverage. [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1828.0s)]
*  And then there was just the abject celebrations of this. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1832.0s)]
*  I'm just going to read you a couple. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1837.0s)]
*  Now, worst among them, because this guy actually has a very popular podcast called The Midas Touch. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1839.0s)]
*  It's a left leaning one. [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1845.0s)]
*  His name is Ron Filipowski. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1846.0s)]
*  And he tweeted out, the people in Texas voted for government services controlled by Trump and Greg Abbott. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1848.0s)]
*  That's exactly what they're getting. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1854.0s)]
*  And he went on to say in one, I think he deleted this one or the other one. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1856.0s)]
*  Also, when you have an entire political movement like MAGA, who has sneering contempt for experts, [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1861.0s)]
*  who have spent decades in a profession like weather forecasters and the need for government to use those experts to save lives, [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1867.0s)]
*  the results of that too often are that many people died. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1874.0s)]
*  Then there's more. [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1878.0s)]
*  Highly followed leftist ex account Brooklyn Dad Defiant says the death count in Texas is now up to 32 people. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1880.0s)]
*  Now, of course, it's up above. [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1887.0s)]
*  At the moment from flooding that could have been projected earlier if not for the devastating Doge cuts to Noah months ago. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1889.0s)]
*  Really? Where did you get that, sir? [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1895.0s)]
*  Because that's not true. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1897.0s)]
*  Trump has blood on his hands and should be held accountable. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1898.0s)]
*  Here's a couple of a couple more from some more prominent left wing accounts. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1901.0s)]
*  OK, this one guy, I can't read his name, but it's Mike. [[00:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1906.0s)]
*  I can't read it. [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1911.0s)]
*  But in any event, he writes, Good. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1912.0s)]
*  I'm glad. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1914.0s)]
*  Did it take Rogan with it, too? [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1915.0s)]
*  I can only hope Texas deserves it. [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1917.0s)]
*  It's God's will, of course. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1919.0s)]
*  That's what God would have wanted. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1921.0s)]
*  Right, Republicans? [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1923.0s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1924.0s)]
*  My empathy for these red, redneck reject states is zero. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1925.0s)]
*  So fuck them. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1929.0s)]
*  I hope more come. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1930.0s)]
*  Let's start the hurricanes. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1931.0s)]
*  There are little girls dead. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1933.0s)]
*  And this is the reaction from this guy. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1935.0s)]
*  Here's another one. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1938.0s)]
*  It's not awful. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1940.0s)]
*  It's what Texas deserves. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1941.0s)]
*  Cry harder, says another one. [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1942.0s)]
*  Texas deserves it. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1944.0s)]
*  Here's another. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1945.0s)]
*  I'm kind of happy the National Weather Service gave incorrect predictions when it came to [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1946.0s)]
*  how much rain would fall, especially since the best and brightest from that organization [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1950.0s)]
*  were let go due to Doge, Elon and Trump and on and on and on. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1954.0s)]
*  They're celebrating. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1959.0s)]
*  They're celebrating that little girls are dead, that that pair of sisters died holding [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1961.0s)]
*  one another. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1968.0s)]
*  They can't think about the suffering of those parents, but the one mom who said that her [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1969.0s)]
*  family will miss her, especially her mommy, all having to write that, having to like write [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1973.0s)]
*  an off the cuff eulogy for your eight year old because you're standing down all the good [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1978.0s)]
*  people and all the good Samaritans who have been out there for the past four days now [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1983.0s)]
*  searching night and day for the missing. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1988.0s)]
*  And of course, in all these stories, Andrew, you find against those awful, soulless people, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1991.0s)]
*  you find the great ones, you know, the ones who died trying to save the little girls or [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=1997.0s)]
*  like this guy recently out of the National Guard who said to save over 160 people like [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2002.0s)]
*  first day on the job and rescued over 160 people. [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2007.0s)]
*  Like you're hearing more and more stories like that, but it really is a juxtaposition of good [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2011.0s)]
*  and evil. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2015.0s)]
*  It's a story like this. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2016.0s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a firm believer and maybe I just believe this to keep myself sane, but I have [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2017.0s)]
*  witnessed it in life. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2022.0s)]
*  I'm a firm believer that the people who tweet those things, that they're glad these children [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2023.0s)]
*  died, that there's something, there's some kind of justice in life that you have to live [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2027.0s)]
*  with that inside yourself. [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2031.0s)]
*  You know, I can't imagine what it would be like to live with that much hatred, even for [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2032.0s)]
*  the people I oppose, you know, to down to my heart and soul. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2036.0s)]
*  I don't feel that way about them. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2040.0s)]
*  I don't want them to lose their children, the people I disagree with every word out of their [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2042.0s)]
*  mouth. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2046.0s)]
*  I still don't want tragedy to befall them. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2047.0s)]
*  I'm never rooting for that. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2050.0s)]
*  I'm never rooting for death. [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2051.0s)]
*  It comes to us all. [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2052.0s)]
*  I've always believed that there's something that the worst thing about having those feelings [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2053.0s)]
*  in your heart is what they do to you, is what they turn you into, what you're like inside, [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2060.0s)]
*  what you're walking around with inside yourself. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2065.0s)]
*  I don't consider myself a righteous person. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2067.0s)]
*  I don't think anybody's really righteous, but I would hate to have to live with that [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2070.0s)]
*  inside of me. [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2074.0s)]
*  I would hate to have to live with that kind of anger and rancor just every day. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2075.0s)]
*  It would be like having a stomach full of acid all the time. [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2080.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, it's like a cancer, a cancer that will eat you alive. [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2084.0s)]
*  Let me just mention this quickly because I mentioned him. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2088.0s)]
*  Not National Guard, Coast Guard. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2090.0s)]
*  This is Marina Medvin posted about him online as did others. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2092.0s)]
*  American hero Scott Ruskin saved 165 people on his first Coast Guard mission in Texas, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2096.0s)]
*  sometimes carrying two girls per arm on to rescue helicopters. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2102.0s)]
*  Those are the ones you need to focus on. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2107.0s)]
*  He's a true hero and there are many more like him who risk their lives. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2110.0s)]
*  You see some of these rescue videos. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2113.0s)]
*  There was one, do we have it cut you guys, where there's an elderly woman, we do, [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2116.0s)]
*  it's V6, an elderly woman, they described her as elderly, I can't totally tell, [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2120.0s)]
*  but she looks like she has gray hair. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2124.0s)]
*  In this water, for the listening audience, you can see the raging waters, [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2126.0s)]
*  you can see a rescuer, these two men, they're wearing their life jackets around their necks [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2129.0s)]
*  and they've gotten a life jacket on her. [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2133.0s)]
*  And then there are men holding a rope on either side trying to like do something [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2135.0s)]
*  to either pull her out. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2139.0s)]
*  It's not exactly clear to me, but they're really struggling given the current. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2141.0s)]
*  And if you watch this full video, Andrew, you can see at one point, [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2144.0s)]
*  like she keeps going under and then the men get sucked under, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2148.0s)]
*  the strong rescuer men get sucked under. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2151.0s)]
*  And at some point during this like four minute video, most of them become in serious danger. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2155.0s)]
*  And then there's people steps away on the shore, but there's only so much they can do [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2162.0s)]
*  because it's like getting caught in like a riptide and finally they get her out. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2165.0s)]
*  But I mean, every rescue puts many lives at risk for the rescuers [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2170.0s)]
*  and you still have guys like Scott Ruskin who did it over and over and over again. [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2175.0s)]
*  You can be standing in two feet, three feet, four feet of water and be washed away. [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2181.0s)]
*  It has happened to me. You can be knocked right on your backside. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2186.0s)]
*  You have no power against the power of a river and against the power of running water. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2189.0s)]
*  You know, one thing this really brings up, and you and I have talked about this before, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2194.0s)]
*  is the power of ideology, what ideology does to you. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2198.0s)]
*  If you have an ideology that dehumanizes people, that sets standards of good and evil [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2201.0s)]
*  according to your opinions of things instead of according to like the moral law that's in every human heart. [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2208.0s)]
*  This is what happens to you. You know, you become dehumanized. You forget all this stuff. [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2214.0s)]
*  Whereas if you have an ideology that is based in love, even if you make mistakes, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2218.0s)]
*  even if you go astray, you're ultimately going to be called to service when people are in trouble [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2224.0s)]
*  or when people are hurt or when people are suffering through tragedy. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2229.0s)]
*  I think it's just something that has happened in this country. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2234.0s)]
*  I did not grow up in a country that had this kind of ideology throbbing through it like this. [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2237.0s)]
*  It was always there, obviously. There's always bad ideology and evil people. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2243.0s)]
*  But somehow at the level of the establishment, at the level of the people who went on the newscasts [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2247.0s)]
*  and talked and wore ties and jackets and were the guys who were supposed to be responsible to us for information, [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2253.0s)]
*  they were not swept away by the river of ideology and not swept into evil by it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2260.0s)]
*  And I just think that it's just something that really needs to be addressed. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2266.0s)]
*  Because of the First Amendment and God bless the First Amendment, it's very hard to reform the media. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2270.0s)]
*  But you just think that somewhere, somewhere at the top of these organizations, [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2275.0s)]
*  human hearts would say, you know, we've got to reform a media that is speaking evil into the world. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2279.0s)]
*  You know, when you see those guys going out there and doing what they do [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2284.0s)]
*  and you talk about that guy who was on his first day of work at the Coast Guard saving over 100 people, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2288.0s)]
*  you know, you understand that there is something called decency and heroism. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2293.0s)]
*  These things really do exist and not all of us can live up to our heroes, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2298.0s)]
*  but we can all live up to some level of decency. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2302.0s)]
*  And I think that that is something that has really disappeared from the establishment in the country. [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2304.0s)]
*  It hasn't disappeared from America. [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2309.0s)]
*  You only have to travel in America and meet people and talk to people to see all the decency in the world you want to. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2311.0s)]
*  But it's at our leadership level. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2316.0s)]
*  And the guy who was complaining, by the way, about the Republican distrust, the conservative distrust of experts, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2318.0s)]
*  I want to consult the experts like Deborah Birx and Anthony Fauci, who lied and lied to us [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2324.0s)]
*  and undermined the power of expertise and the credibility of experts. [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2329.0s)]
*  Because I agree, there are such things as experts, but right now they're in bad odor because of the fact that they betrayed the country. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2333.0s)]
*  And so, you know, where you place the blame for these things is a question of how far back in time you're willing to go [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2340.0s)]
*  to the actions of the people who are being blamed. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2348.0s)]
*  I see those guys in the water, Andrew, and I think, okay, you know, Scott Ruskin, God love him. [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2350.0s)]
*  He's a professional rescuer, day one, indeed, but he's a professional rescuer who signed up to rescue. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2355.0s)]
*  The odds are those guys we just saw in the water trying to save that older woman, they're probably volunteer firemen. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2361.0s)]
*  Those are the overwhelming odds. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2369.0s)]
*  It's a very rural town. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2371.0s)]
*  I mean, I spend my summers in a more rural New Jersey beach town, and if there is an emergency of any kind, they sound the fire alarm. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2373.0s)]
*  There's not a firehouse where they're all sitting around. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2380.0s)]
*  They sound the loud alarm, and all the volunteer firefighters and EMS guys go running, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2383.0s)]
*  and they put their lives in the line at a moment's notice. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2389.0s)]
*  I guarantee you it's a situation not unlike that. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2391.0s)]
*  You see these guys in the water. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2394.0s)]
*  They're not like the completely fit. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2395.0s)]
*  That guy looks like he's straight out of Top Gun, to his credit. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2397.0s)]
*  I'm not mocking him. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2400.0s)]
*  But, you know, those guys in the water, they look like normal guys. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2401.0s)]
*  They look like maybe a little older, maybe a few extra pounds. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2404.0s)]
*  Still, they went into that water. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2408.0s)]
*  Still, they risked their lives. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2410.0s)]
*  They probably have families. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2411.0s)]
*  They risked their role as dads to save somebody else's important person. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2412.0s)]
*  And for me, I know this is a weird possible non sequitur, but I went to Mass on Sunday yesterday. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2417.0s)]
*  And they do this every year down here, and I love it. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2422.0s)]
*  I love it. I love it. [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2424.0s)]
*  We went. We listened to the Mass. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2425.0s)]
*  We observed Mass, and it ended this year as it did last year and the year before that. [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2427.0s)]
*  They sing the last hymn, and at the very tail end of that hymn, as soon as it ends. [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2432.0s)]
*  And by the way, it was Be Not Afraid, which was just such a great one. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2439.0s)]
*  So moving. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2443.0s)]
*  They burst into the whole congregation led by the cantor. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2446.0s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2450.0s)]
*  And it was just, it just makes you feel something from deep within. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2452.0s)]
*  God bless America. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2458.0s)]
*  And I look at those guys. [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2460.0s)]
*  That's what I think. Those Texans risking their lives, probably volunteer. [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2462.0s)]
*  Like, God bless America. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2465.0s)]
*  God bless them. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2466.0s)]
*  God bless the helpers. [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2467.0s)]
*  I have almost no use for these, sorry, fucking cretins online. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2469.0s)]
*  Who don't understand us or what we're here for or what we're really about or the goodness of this country at its heart and soul, irrespective of partisan politics. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2474.0s)]
*  Oh, wait, and I'll give you one more. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2482.0s)]
*  This is an emotional journey of a comment. [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2483.0s)]
*  Because you've got these wonderful people and you've got these terrible people, but I've got to get this person in. [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2486.0s)]
*  Her name is Sadie Perkins. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2491.0s)]
*  She is a fellow. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2493.0s)]
*  She's a non-resident fellow at Princeton University, previously one of our most respected institutions. [[00:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2495.0s)]
*  It means that they've given her a big grant. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2500.0s)]
*  I think it's a $1 million grant she got a couple years ago, post George Floyd, 2022, to research how black religious leaders and communities responded to COVID, climate and environmental crises or struggles for racial justice. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2502.0s)]
*  Any one of those three will do. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2516.0s)]
*  They give grants from this project. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2518.0s)]
*  So that makes her a fellow at Princeton University. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2520.0s)]
*  And here is what Sadie Perkins, non-resident fellow at Princeton, was concerned about as she watched children die. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2523.0s)]
*  Does it? [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2546.0s)]
*  But you best believe, especially in today's political climate, if this were a group of Hispanic girls, especially with them being in East Texas, it should be most likely Hispanic. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2553.0s)]
*  If this were a group of Hispanic girls out there, this would not be getting this type of coverage that they're getting. [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2565.0s)]
*  No one would give a fuck. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2571.0s)]
*  And all these white people, the parents of these little girls would be saying things like they need to be deported. [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2573.0s)]
*  They want you to get out of your bed and to come out of your home and to go find these people and donate your money to go find these people. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2577.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're deporting your family members. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2584.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, they're setting up concentration camps and prisons for your family members. [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2587.0s)]
*  And I need you all to keep that in mind before you all get out there and put on your rain boots and go find these little girls. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2593.0s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2600.0s)]
*  There's people with no shut up button in their hearts. [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2602.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2606.0s)]
*  It's unbelievable. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2608.0s)]
*  She's truly depraved. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2609.0s)]
*  There's something to print. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2611.0s)]
*  Princeton University must do something. [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2612.0s)]
*  I don't know if she's still on her million dollar grant, what it is, but whatever it is must be pulled. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2615.0s)]
*  It absolutely must be severed. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2619.0s)]
*  Princeton University must make a statement. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2622.0s)]
*  She's calling the parents of the dead children racists based on absolutely nothing but a figment of her imagination and the pictures she's seen that they're white and the information she heard that they're Christian and discouraging while she does the cover her ass. [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2625.0s)]
*  Oh, it's not to say we don't want them to be found. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2643.0s)]
*  She finishes it up with you better think about this before you get out there and you put on your raincoats to try to go find these girls. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2645.0s)]
*  You think about how they're racists and how they'd be letting your people die if you're Hispanic. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2651.0s)]
*  Holy shit. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2656.0s)]
*  Yeah, I like the word that I'll probably be canceled for this, you know, cancel culture, which conservatives complain so much about was really a culture in which if you disagreed politically, you were deemed to be immoral. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2658.0s)]
*  But it's not wrong to cancel people when they're actually immoral to tell people that before you go out and try to rescue children, you have to take some kind of bizarre, you know, critical race idea into your head. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2669.0s)]
*  You know, even if there was some kind of truth or legitimacy to critical racery, which there isn't, but even if there were, there would be nothing that should stop you from putting on boots and going out and helping people if you can do it. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2681.0s)]
*  So this idea that you're being canceled if you do something that's actually immoral, that if you do something that is actually cruel and stupid and evil, that's not being canceled. [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2694.0s)]
*  That's simply just human decency in society, basically regurgitating something that it shouldn't have swallowed in the first place. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2703.0s)]
*  And you're absolutely right. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2710.0s)]
*  Princeton is responsible for addressing this. [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2711.0s)]
*  I think that in some ways, whoever these people are who are saying these things that you're reading that are legitimately shocking, legitimately mind blowing that people could do this, whoever is in charge of those people, whoever is giving them money, whoever is giving them support should really take a look at what they're doing and giving them a platform. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2714.0s)]
*  Because I don't understand why we have to I understand that people are free to say evil things, but I don't think that we are. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2734.0s)]
*  I think we are equally free to react to those evil things and turn them off and withdraw our support from them. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2741.0s)]
*  I don't believe this should be censored at all. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2747.0s)]
*  I actually don't believe they should be censored. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2749.0s)]
*  I want those people to expose themselves. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2751.0s)]
*  I want them to say what they have to say. [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2753.0s)]
*  But we as an audience and we as the people who pay people to say things, I think we can shut people down when they say things like this. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2754.0s)]
*  There's another woman who bears mention. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2762.0s)]
*  She's a pediatrician. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2765.0s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2767.0s)]
*  A pediatrician in Texas who suggested that these Texas flood victims got what they deserved. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2768.0s)]
*  She posted as follows. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2775.0s)]
*  Her name is Dr. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2776.0s)]
*  Christina B. Probst. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2777.0s)]
*  P-R-O-P-S-T. [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2779.0s)]
*  She drew widespread scorn, quoting here from the New York Post, following her disparaging, since deleted, Facebook post under her old name, which was Christina. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2781.0s)]
*  That was her username. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2791.0s)]
*  May all visitors, children, non-MAGA voters and pets be safe and dry, she wrote. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2792.0s)]
*  She goes on. [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2798.0s)]
*  Kerr County MAGA voted to gut FEMA. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2799.0s)]
*  They deny climate change. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2803.0s)]
*  May they get what they voted for. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2805.0s)]
*  Bless their hearts. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2807.0s)]
*  And first, at first, her employer, Bluefish Pediatrics, said she'd been suspended and then announced she's no longer employed there, saying they have there's no room for her. [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2808.0s)]
*  There's no room for politicization of a tragedy like this. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2820.0s)]
*  No word on what's going to happen with her with the Texas Medical Board. [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2823.0s)]
*  She's in charge of taking care of children. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2826.0s)]
*  Do the parents who bring their children to her as their pediatrician know this is how she feels if you voted for Trump? [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2828.0s)]
*  She thinks your child deserved deserves any death that she can blame on climate change or a Trump doge or big, beautiful bill initiative, because that appears to be how she sees the world. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2834.0s)]
*  They're lurking. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2846.0s)]
*  We saw this after 10-7, Andrew. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2847.0s)]
*  You know, we're like people weren't just saying, I've got real problems with Israel. [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2848.0s)]
*  I don't condone the death that, you know, this terrorism we saw in 10-7. [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2853.0s)]
*  But, you know, these people can't live under blockade, right? [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2856.0s)]
*  That which would which would have been it would have been a reasonable way to react if you're pro-Palestinian. [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2860.0s)]
*  No, they loved it. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2864.0s)]
*  They love the hostages. [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2866.0s)]
*  They tore down their pictures, wanting them to remain in captivity and to suffer like I don't I know. [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2867.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm beating a dead horse. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2874.0s)]
*  There's something dead inside people. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2876.0s)]
*  I talk about politics all day for a living. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2878.0s)]
*  You do, too. [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2880.0s)]
*  I've been doing this for 20 plus years, immersed in the most vicious political battles for that time. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2881.0s)]
*  It hasn't hardened my heart. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2887.0s)]
*  I recognize insane people. [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2889.0s)]
*  I try not to generalize too much about the left as being awful because I love people on the left. [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2891.0s)]
*  You know, my mom's still a registered Democrat. [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2896.0s)]
*  Some of my best friends are liberals. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2898.0s)]
*  There's a hardness happening here. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2900.0s)]
*  And there's something else happening on the left that was in the news this weekend. [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2902.0s)]
*  Gallup showing for the first time ever. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2905.0s)]
*  The Democrats don't love America. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2907.0s)]
*  They're not patriotic. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2909.0s)]
*  They're not proud to be Americans. [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2910.0s)]
*  Republicans have remained steady at 92, 93 percent for 20 plus years. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2912.0s)]
*  Democrats have gone off a cliff. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2918.0s)]
*  More people now say they hate America on the left than say they're proud to be American. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2920.0s)]
*  It's all part of the same sickness. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2924.0s)]
*  It is. And it is an ideological sickness. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2927.0s)]
*  It is something you can blame on ideology when ideology trumps morality. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2930.0s)]
*  Look, we are built. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2933.0s)]
*  We are built to know right from wrong. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2934.0s)]
*  We do know right from wrong. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2936.0s)]
*  The struggle we have is not knowing it. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2937.0s)]
*  It's doing it. [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2940.0s)]
*  Sometimes, you know, doing the right thing interferes with our personal interests. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2941.0s)]
*  And so you're tempted to follow your personal interests instead of doing the right thing. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2944.0s)]
*  But ideology is the single force. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2948.0s)]
*  And Alexander Sulzhenitsyn wrote about this. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2950.0s)]
*  Ideology is the single force that can wipe that knowledge out of our minds and out of our hearts. [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2952.0s)]
*  And that is the problem that the left has. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2957.0s)]
*  Yes, there are people on the right. [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2959.0s)]
*  But on the far right, people on the fringe who have this problem. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2961.0s)]
*  But the center of the Democrat Party, the center of the left, has now basically let ideology wipe morality out of their hearts. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2964.0s)]
*  And this is the result. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2972.0s)]
*  It's just so awful. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2974.0s)]
*  There's much more to cover. [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2976.0s)]
*  And we will do that. [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2977.0s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2978.0s)]
*  More with Andrew right after this. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2980.0s)]
*  We'll get into Jeffrey Epstein and the FBI. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2981.0s)]
*  Plus, Selena Zito is coming up on her new book about Butler, Pennsylvania, as we approach the one-year mark. [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2983.0s)]
*  She's got some chilling information in there about Donald Trump and about the shooter who actually did take a shot and hit Trump that day and killed Corey Carpitori. [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=2989.0s)]
*  We talk a lot about personal freedom on this show. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3003.0s)]
*  Well, part of that is owning your privacy. [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3005.0s)]
*  And let me tell you, if you have ever Googled your name and found your home address, phone number or even your income floating around, it's not a coincidence. [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3007.0s)]
*  That data is bought and sold by data brokers without your consent. [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3014.0s)]
*  And this is why I want to tell you about Incogni, a service that fights back on your behalf. [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3018.0s)]

*  It's FBI and DOJ coming out with a shocking announcement for many. [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3099.0s)]
*  Well, I've talked to others who are closer to the case who say they're not shocked. [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3106.0s)]
*  And they've been saying that there's really this is just the stuff of conspiracy theories all along, [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3110.0s)]
*  that he had some blackmail list, some long client list that was going to wow everybody, [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3114.0s)]
*  that that there wouldn't be videos that would incriminate necessarily Epstein or those around him. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3119.0s)]
*  But and that and that he that he was the non conspiracy theorists say obviously he killed himself. [[00:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3126.0s)]
*  OK, so here's the story. [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3133.0s)]
*  DOJ FBI have concluded they have no evidence that Epstein blackmailed powerful figures, [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3135.0s)]
*  that he kept a client list or that he was murdered, according to a memo detailing the findings that was leaked to Axios. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3140.0s)]
*  So clearly our friends who we love, Bongino and or Patel, leaked it to Axios, which is interesting. [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3147.0s)]
*  I mean, why Axios? That's not really a Republican friendly site. [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3154.0s)]
*  They probably aren't steeped that deeply in all things Epstein. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3159.0s)]
*  I don't know, but it was leaked to Axios. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3165.0s)]
*  Maybe I'm wrong. No further charges are expected in connection with the probes into Epstein, [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3167.0s)]
*  as investigators, quote, did not uncover evidence that could predicate an investigation against uncharged third parties. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3172.0s)]
*  The DOJ and FBI say in the memo, no further disclosure of Epstein related material would be appropriate or warranted. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3179.0s)]
*  So we are done getting any Epstein material. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3186.0s)]
*  The memo says much of the material relates to child sexual abuse and details of Epstein's victims, [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3191.0s)]
*  as opposed to like other third parties who were swept up into his awfulness. [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3196.0s)]
*  The files related to Epstein include a large volume of images of Epstein, images and videos of victims who are either minors or appear to be, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3201.0s)]
*  and over 10,000 downloaded videos and images of illegal child sex abuse material and other pornography. [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3208.0s)]
*  Through this review, we found no basis to revisit the disclosure of those materials will not permit the release of the child pornography, obviously. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3214.0s)]
*  Consistent with our prior disclosures, this review confirmed Epstein harmed over 1,000 victims, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3221.0s)]
*  but they're not expanding those conclusions to anything beyond Epstein. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3226.0s)]
*  They've also released video. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3231.0s)]
*  What they say is 10 hours of raw and also enhanced videos, meaning enhanced just so we can see it a little better and the colors better, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3234.0s)]
*  that they say indicates no one entered the area of the Manhattan prison where Epstein was held the night he died. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3243.0s)]
*  Many are pouring over this video footage right now, which goes from between 1040 p.m. on August 9th, 2019, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3248.0s)]
*  when he was locked in his cell to around 630 a.m. the next day when he was found unresponsive. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3254.0s)]
*  They say that it shows no one entering the area and or leaving the area but already loose on online or suggesting there are cuts or jump cuts. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3258.0s)]
*  We have not independently examined it, so we're not in a position to comment on that. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3269.0s)]
*  Here's why it's causing such a problem, including amongst many people who love Vangino and Patel. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3273.0s)]
*  Maybe not so much Bondi, because we've been told over and over and over again that they did have materials. [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3280.0s)]
*  And I'll get I'll take you through some of those. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3288.0s)]
*  Here's Pam Bondi in February of this year talking about Epstein's client list that they now tell us does not exist. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3291.0s)]
*  DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients. [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3300.0s)]
*  Will that really happen? [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3305.0s)]
*  It's sitting on my desk right now to review. [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3307.0s)]
*  That's been a directive by President Trump. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3310.0s)]
*  I'm reviewing that I'm reviewing JFK files, MLK files. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3313.0s)]
*  That's all in the process of being reviewed because that was done at the directive of the president from all of these agencies. [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3316.0s)]
*  So so have you seen anything there? [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3322.0s)]
*  You said, oh, my gosh. [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3324.0s)]
*  Not yet. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3326.0s)]
*  She explicitly said the Epstein client list was sitting on her desk. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3330.0s)]
*  And now they explicitly say they have no evidence that he kept a client list. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3336.0s)]
*  OK, so that's one. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3342.0s)]
*  Then she brought a bunch of conservative influencers to the White House. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3343.0s)]
*  And I'm told this was a Pam Bondi operation that didn't have like the blessing of the FBI or necessarily the White House staff either. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3347.0s)]
*  She brought them to the White House, gave them binders that said it was like the Epstein files, and they all were embarrassed because it turned out that there was no more than I think 200 documents of materials that were already public, [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3355.0s)]
*  which in these influencers defense, they did not know they were trusting the attorney general of the United States, who for some reason thought it would be a good idea to humiliate some of President Trump's most ardent supporters and people who helped get him elected, [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3368.0s)]
*  which for which she hasn't been forgiven by a lot of these folks. [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3384.0s)]
*  I know many of them. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3387.0s)]
*  Then she came out a little later in February and said on Hannity the following sought eight. [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3388.0s)]
*  You're looking at these documents when these aren't all the Epstein files. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3395.0s)]
*  You know, they were flight logs. [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3399.0s)]
*  They were names and victims names. [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3400.0s)]
*  And we're going, where's the rest of the stuff? [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3402.0s)]
*  And that's what the FBI had turned over to us. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3404.0s)]
*  And so a source said, whoa, all this evidence is sitting in the Southern District of New York. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3407.0s)]
*  So based on that, I gave them the deadline Friday at eight. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3412.0s)]
*  A truckload of evidence arrived. [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3416.0s)]
*  It's now in the possession of the FBI. [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3418.0s)]
*  Cash is going to get me and himself really a detailed report as to why all these documents and evidence had been withheld. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3420.0s)]
*  And, you know, we're going to go through it, go through it as fast as we can, but go through it very cautiously to protect all the victims of Epstein. [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3429.0s)]
*  So that's her blaming the FBI. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3437.0s)]
*  There were additional files. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3440.0s)]
*  I didn't mean to embarrass the influencers. [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3441.0s)]
*  It's the FBI's fault, but I'm going to get them. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3443.0s)]
*  Then you have Pam Bondi caught on tape by James O'Keefe. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3446.0s)]
*  And as soon as it came out, like that, he had this and was about to hit. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3451.0s)]
*  It was about to hit. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3456.0s)]
*  He went to her for comment. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3457.0s)]
*  Obviously, she got on camera and affirmatively said it as though she she meant to say it all along. [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3458.0s)]
*  It was like it seemed to me to be a CYA. [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3464.0s)]
*  Like I said nothing special to James O'Keefe. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3466.0s)]
*  I'll say it right now on camera. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3468.0s)]
*  And I happen to know that this caused a lot of consternation inside some of these national security socials where they didn't know what she was doing. [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3470.0s)]
*  Here is SOT 10. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3478.0s)]
*  There are tens of thousands of videos of Epstein with children or child porn. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3481.0s)]
*  And there are hundreds of victims and no one victim will ever get released. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3489.0s)]
*  It's just the volume. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3495.0s)]
*  And that's what they're going through right now. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3496.0s)]
*  The FBI is diligently going through that. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3498.0s)]
*  OK, so that that piece of it is somewhat consistent with what they said in this statement, which is there's a lot of child sexual assault material online. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3503.0s)]
*  But she left it open like it hundreds of victims of Epstein's or of others that Epstein has. [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3512.0s)]
*  Like this is the kind of thing you need to be really specific about. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3520.0s)]
*  And we were left with yet another question mark. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3523.0s)]
*  Now, here's Alina Habba, whose we're also now working at DOJ on Piers Morgan. [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3526.0s)]
*  But in this case, in Epstein's case, it is incredibly disturbing. [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3533.0s)]
*  We have flight logs. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3537.0s)]
*  We have information, names that will come out. [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3538.0s)]
*  Is it going to be shocking? [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3542.0s)]
*  I don't see how it's not shocking that there were so many individuals that were hidden and kept secret and not been held accountable. [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3543.0s)]
*  Let's talk about the reverse. [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3555.0s)]
*  I believe in accountability. [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3556.0s)]
*  So you have to now go through your process. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3557.0s)]
*  Now, I won't say they're guilty until they go through their time in court. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3560.0s)]
*  But again, now it's time for accountability. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3564.0s)]
*  We have seen for so many years, Piers in this country, he's been in the court for a long time. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3566.0s)]
*  We have seen for so many years, Piers in this country, many investigations, subpoenas, testimonies in Congress, et cetera, et cetera. [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3570.0s)]
*  But there's a general frustration with accountability. [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3578.0s)]
*  We take it halfway. [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3580.0s)]
*  We don't take it home. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3581.0s)]
*  And I really believe that now with cash and Pam, there will be accountability. [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3582.0s)]
*  That was February. [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3588.0s)]
*  So now she says they have information and the names to will come out. [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3589.0s)]
*  So many individuals who have been hidden, kept secret, haven't been held accountable. [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3594.0s)]
*  She won't yet say that they're guilty until they've had their time in court. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3600.0s)]
*  But there's been a frustration with accountability. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3605.0s)]
*  OK, now we get there's no client list. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3608.0s)]
*  There's no evidence that he blackmailed anybody and there's nobody else who's going to be charged and no additional information that will be released. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3612.0s)]
*  I'm sorry, but I fully understand why people are extremely doubtful and frustrated with what's being released right now by the administration and what's being told to them. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3620.0s)]
*  This is extremely upsetting. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3630.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm a big Dan Bongino fan. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3633.0s)]
*  I judge him to be a man of integrity who really is committed to doing the right thing. [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3635.0s)]
*  I've met Cash Patel, but I don't know Cash Patel, but I've always been favorably impressed by him. [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3640.0s)]
*  So there's so much to talk about here. [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3644.0s)]
*  Let's just go back to what you talked about of the leak to Axios. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3647.0s)]
*  Never mind their political leanings. [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3651.0s)]
*  It was released at the end of a holiday weekend, which is when you dump information you're hoping no one will pay attention to. [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3652.0s)]
*  That's the first thing there is. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3659.0s)]
*  Pam Bondi and this list, there's Cash Patel two years ago calling for this list to be brought forward. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3660.0s)]
*  I am willing because of my respect for Dan and my respect for Cash Patel. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3667.0s)]
*  I am willing to stipulate that Jeffrey Epstein did not commit suicide. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3671.0s)]
*  If I can include the idea that it was some kind of Godfather 2 situation where suddenly all the cameras went off, suddenly all the guards disappeared, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3676.0s)]
*  suddenly all the cellmates were removed from his cell. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3685.0s)]
*  So he was allowed to commit suicide and maybe protect some other interests that he had beyond his own life and avoid going to prison for the rest of his life. [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3688.0s)]
*  So all right, I'll buy that he didn't commit suicide and the evidence says that he didn't commit suicide. [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3697.0s)]
*  But when you tell me that there's no list, my questions just get broader and bigger. [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3702.0s)]
*  They don't get less. [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3709.0s)]
*  If there's no list of people who did things, are there no witnesses? [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3710.0s)]
*  Are the people, the children and the young people who were abused, have they made no accusations? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3714.0s)]
*  Can they not be questioned? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3719.0s)]
*  Can they not be asked who was it who raped you? [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3720.0s)]
*  Who was it who used you again and again? [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3722.0s)]
*  Some of these women have come forward and said, you know, I was raped again and again. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3724.0s)]
*  Well, by whom? [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3728.0s)]
*  Did you recognize the person? [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3729.0s)]
*  Can you identify him in a photo array? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3731.0s)]
*  Galeen Maxwell is in prison for 20 years. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3734.0s)]
*  Is there no deal that you would expect that you would accept to get less prison time and come on and say, you know, yeah, let me tell you who I who I brought into this to this island? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3737.0s)]
*  You know, this is something that is so widespread in America and maybe throughout the world. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3748.0s)]
*  This abuse of young people, this use of young people for your own personal pleasure that I think it really has to be addressed at the highest level and has to be addressed in the harshest possible way. [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3753.0s)]
*  So I'm not satisfied with you saying, you know, Pam Bondi misspoke or whatever the hell she did when she said, yes, this list is on my desk. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3764.0s)]
*  All right. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3772.0s)]
*  So there's no list. [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3773.0s)]
*  Is there no way of attaining names and information from the people who were victimized? [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3774.0s)]
*  Are there no accusations that are going to be made? [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3779.0s)]
*  Is nobody willing to make these accusations? [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3782.0s)]
*  I mean, this thing has been covered up so completely, including at ABC News, where we were talking before about George Stephanopoulos and why he was hired being hired because he silenced women for Bill Clinton. [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3785.0s)]
*  Then then we know from Amy Robach, the tape that was released of Amy Robach, that that was spiked during Hillary Clinton's run. [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3798.0s)]
*  And they said we had it all. [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3806.0s)]
*  We had it all. Clinton, she mentioned him. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3808.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3810.0s)]
*  So so I'm sorry. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3811.0s)]
*  This is not holding together. [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3812.0s)]
*  And I think a guy of the quality of Dan Bongino should be coming forward with it. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3814.0s)]
*  I know people who know him inside the administration. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3818.0s)]
*  I know he's working like a dog. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3821.0s)]
*  He's trying hard to rejigger the FBI from the corrupt state. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3822.0s)]
*  It fell into under Biden and under Obama as well. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3826.0s)]
*  I think they are working hard to to clean out the FBI. [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3829.0s)]
*  But something about this case, there is a stumbling block here. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3833.0s)]
*  And by the way, I don't believe that it's Donald Trump. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3837.0s)]
*  I actually believe that Donald Trump was not part of this situation. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3840.0s)]
*  If Donald Trump were in the Epstein files and in any meaningful way, Joe Biden would have told us. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3844.0s)]
*  You betcha. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3850.0s)]
*  And also, he threw the guy out of Mar-a-Lago. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3851.0s)]
*  He made jokes about the fact that he likes him young. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3854.0s)]
*  Those are not the words of somebody who's participating in this abuse. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3856.0s)]
*  This goes on in Hollywood. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3860.0s)]
*  It goes on in churches. [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3861.0s)]
*  It went on in England when Muslims were collecting these little girls for their own personal use and the government covered it up. [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3863.0s)]
*  This is something that is still doing. [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3870.0s)]
*  There's still a story just today about Taliban. [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3872.0s)]
*  Some Taliban leader wanted to marry a six year old and they said, oh, you got to wait until she's nine. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3875.0s)]
*  She's not like they like Mohammed. [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3880.0s)]
*  You know, I think that I think that this is something that is somehow so interlaced in our society that maybe there's no way that maybe we just take a superhero to say, I don't care who I bring down. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3882.0s)]
*  I don't care what threats I'm given. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3895.0s)]
*  You know, every now and again, they arrest some poor schmuck who's got, you know, child porn on his on his computer. [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3898.0s)]
*  And yes, that's evil. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3906.0s)]
*  That's wicked. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3907.0s)]
*  You should be arrested for it. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3908.0s)]
*  But why is it that the guys who actually do this stuff or a powerful people who are people of substance and people of money and who are using innocent girls who don't have that kind of influence and don't have that kind of money? [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3909.0s)]
*  Why is it that they are never arrested and never named? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3921.0s)]
*  This is a moment for cash and then to really stand up. [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3924.0s)]
*  It's not enough to leak this at the end of the Fourth of July weekend. [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3927.0s)]
*  You've got to come forward and tell me why you cannot get the names of people from the people who were abused. [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3932.0s)]
*  Do you recognize this guy? [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3939.0s)]
*  Do you recognize anybody in this photo array? [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3941.0s)]
*  Was this the person who raped you? [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3943.0s)]
*  I don't understand. [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3945.0s)]
*  I don't understand why Galeen Maxwell was not offered some kind of deal to get the names out of her. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3946.0s)]
*  So maybe she doesn't have to serve 20 years. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3951.0s)]
*  Galeen went to prison for helping Jeffrey Epstein and in his sex trafficking and his behavior toward these young women. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3953.0s)]
*  But the trial evidence against her was about procuring young women for Jeffrey. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3962.0s)]
*  It wasn't for others. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3969.0s)]
*  It wasn't like she was the main sort of. [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3971.0s)]
*  She was there. [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3973.0s)]
*  She was. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3974.0s)]
*  No, I know. [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3975.0s)]
*  I'm just saying like just people online are like, what did she get convicted of? [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3976.0s)]
*  She got convicted of funneling girls to Jeffrey. [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3979.0s)]
*  And I'll play devil's advocate for a minute. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3981.0s)]
*  And we should explore this. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3983.0s)]
*  OK, let's explore the possibility that you have to put Pam Bondi's statements to the side in order to go down this lane with me because I don't know what she's doing. [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3984.0s)]
*  I got to be honest. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3993.0s)]
*  But I really do trust Dan. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3994.0s)]
*  Dan, Dan is a wonderful guy and he's a very straight shooter. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=3996.0s)]
*  He's all heart. [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4001.0s)]
*  He's totally earnest. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4003.0s)]
*  I don't believe Dan is lying to us. [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4005.0s)]
*  I just I don't. [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4006.0s)]
*  I don't know cash as well. [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4008.0s)]
*  I don't mean to indict him at all. [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4009.0s)]
*  I'm just saying I don't know him the way I know Dan, who's been coming on the show for years. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4010.0s)]
*  We've had long, many long hours and hours and hours. [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4013.0s)]
*  It's like you. [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4016.0s)]
*  I know him like I know you. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4017.0s)]
*  Like I just no one's going to convince me he would go out there and just blatantly lie. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4018.0s)]
*  I don't believe it. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4021.0s)]
*  So let's go down the line of he's telling the truth and cash is again. [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4022.0s)]
*  We're checking Pam Bondi's weird statements for now. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4026.0s)]
*  I know somebody very close to the Epstein case. [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4029.0s)]
*  I've never said who this is, but this is a very, very well informed person. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4032.0s)]
*  And this person from the beginning has told me that Epstein was into young girls. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4037.0s)]
*  I don't know what he looked at online. [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4045.0s)]
*  I believe he probably did look at what now they just call child sexual assault material. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4046.0s)]
*  We used to call it child pornography. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4051.0s)]
*  I believe he was probably into that. [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4053.0s)]
*  But this person was saying in terms of what Jeffrey wanted brought to him at his mansions and his island, it was the barely legal type. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4054.0s)]
*  It was like the 17 year old girl. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4062.0s)]
*  Or the 16. [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4065.0s)]
*  I'm not justifying any of this. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4066.0s)]
*  I'm just telling you what's been told to me by a very reliable person that that's what he was into. [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4067.0s)]
*  And in many states, that's not unlawful. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4072.0s)]
*  You know, the 17 year old sex partner for a grown man is actually not illegal. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4076.0s)]
*  Now in some it is. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4081.0s)]
*  And he got in trouble in Florida. [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4082.0s)]
*  So that's it is a possibility that that was his thing when it came to actual sexual interactions. [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4085.0s)]
*  Forget what he was looking at online. [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4091.0s)]
*  And it is a thing that, you know, he had some of those girls who weren't committing crimes with powerful men. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4093.0s)]
*  And that while he had a very interesting black book that had names, including Donald Trump's in it, that doesn't amount to a client list. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4100.0s)]
*  And there aren't young girls who can point the fingers. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4108.0s)]
*  There is Virginia Dufray, who recently died, who was the girl pictured with Prince Andrew in those infamous Daily Mail photos that we've all seen where she was, I think, 17. [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4111.0s)]
*  And with Prince Andrew. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4122.0s)]
*  This is why he got excommunicated from his family. [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4123.0s)]
*  She says they the girls were being funneled out to third parties, to other men, and that she was one of them. [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4126.0s)]
*  But I'm sorry, Virginia Dufray is a proven was God rest her. [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4133.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4137.0s)]
*  Liar. [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4138.0s)]
*  A proven liar. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4139.0s)]
*  And not only do I firmly believe she lied about Alan Dershowitz, and she admitted she might have been confused about him. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4140.0s)]
*  But there's a lot of stuff she said turned out to be just totally false. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4148.0s)]
*  It's complicated because these victims, you know, these predators choose them for a reason. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4153.0s)]
*  They'll choose a girl like that because they know maybe she's going to have credibility problems and so on. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4158.0s)]
*  So I'm trying not to be disrespectful to her. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4163.0s)]
*  But there's no question that Virginia Dufray did tell a lot of lies. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4165.0s)]
*  And then there's a lot of other people who, when Jeffrey Upstein went down, set, saw dollar signs in their eyeballs because he was not forget he was very rich and said, I know something. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4168.0s)]
*  I want to pay out or I was a victim and I want to pay out. [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4177.0s)]
*  And it wasn't always true. [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4181.0s)]
*  All of these are complicated factors, complicating factors in like the lure around him. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4182.0s)]
*  And it is possible this guy did not want to spend the rest of his life in prison. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4188.0s)]
*  He was used to all the trappings of wealth. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4192.0s)]
*  You know, Arthur Idala has talked about this. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4195.0s)]
*  He represented Ghislaine Maxwell that that it's a terrible place where he was being held. [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4197.0s)]
*  You know, he spent a couple hours in there and felt dark and depressed and, you know, sad. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4202.0s)]
*  And he wasn't getting sentenced. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4206.0s)]
*  He was there as a lawyer. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4207.0s)]
*  It is very possible he was extremely depressed, realized that he was going to go to jail forever and decided to take his own life. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4209.0s)]
*  So all of that really is possible. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4215.0s)]
*  And, you know, conspiracy theories do spring when we're not being told to straight skinny, as we weren't for years after Jeffrey died and so on. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4218.0s)]
*  So I'm leaving room for the possibility that it really is less nefarious, not not not nefarious, but less nefarious than we were told. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4225.0s)]
*  And maybe we've just been so spun up by so many spinners that now when you have people you can trust telling you what's real, it's hard to believe. [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4234.0s)]
*  But, you know, my problem with that explanation and again, I'm putting the suicide aside because I agree with you about this. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4244.0s)]
*  I do think it's possible that he did he killed himself, although I do think it's kind of interesting that every camera went off, every guard was gone, every cellmate had been removed. [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4251.0s)]
*  I think maybe it was convenient for him to kill himself. [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4259.0s)]
*  But still, I'm perfectly willing to believe that. [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4262.0s)]
*  Let's let's just say that everything you said was true. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4265.0s)]
*  You're cash Patel. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4268.0s)]
*  And again, like, I really like these guys. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4269.0s)]
*  I like both of them. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4272.0s)]
*  And I know more about them than I know about cash Patel. [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4273.0s)]
*  But still, they both favorably impressed me and I trusted them and I trust them still. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4276.0s)]
*  But a couple of years ago, cash Patel is on the air saying this is a conspiracy. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4281.0s)]
*  There's a list. [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4287.0s)]
*  We've got to get this out. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4288.0s)]
*  And now he's ahead of the FBI and he finds out, oh, all of these things that I said to the public are untrue. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4289.0s)]
*  You leak that to Axios at the end of the Fourth of July weekend or do you come out and you face the cameras and say, you know what? [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4295.0s)]
*  I'm no one could be more surprised than I am. [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4302.0s)]
*  You know, I put this stuff forward. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4305.0s)]
*  I put these ideas forward. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4307.0s)]
*  I was wrong. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4308.0s)]
*  And this is why I was wrong. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4309.0s)]
*  And this is why I can't show you everything and just really lay it out for you and take responsibility for the things that he said, because he's one of the people who made you think like, gee, something is going on behind the scenes. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4310.0s)]
*  You're also right, by the way, that you have to leave Pam Bondi out of this because I don't understand what the hell she's been talking about. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4322.0s)]
*  And that's that's something that she should be really held responsible for. [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4329.0s)]
*  And I think that's something that she should be really held responsible for. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4334.0s)]
*  She did go on and say, you played that clip, but she went on and said at other places as well that she had a list that she was just going to check out. [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4337.0s)]
*  We're on the verge of finding out. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4345.0s)]
*  And it's just been strange, Megan. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4347.0s)]
*  And I mean, yeah, it's possible. [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4349.0s)]
*  It is possible that all of those bricks fall into place. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4352.0s)]
*  He didn't break the law, even if he just skirted the law by by finding girls who were just within legal limits. [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4355.0s)]
*  He broke the law. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4362.0s)]
*  Why aren't they talking? [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4363.0s)]
*  You know, why aren't they coming forward and saying things? [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4364.0s)]
*  Why? Why is it that many of have sued him? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4367.0s)]
*  I mean, he actually had what he was. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4369.0s)]
*  He's dead now, but he was facing civil suits from some. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4371.0s)]
*  And Virginia Dufres, she had to civil suit and Ghislaine has gotten sued. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4375.0s)]
*  So there are some who have come forward. [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4379.0s)]
*  It's not like two dozen. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4382.0s)]
*  And most I think a lot of women want nothing to do. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4384.0s)]
*  They don't want their names associated with this case whatsoever. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4387.0s)]
*  But we don't have some full list of victims. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4390.0s)]
*  And presumably the FBI knows more than we do. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4392.0s)]
*  But so far, what they seem to be saying is it was Jeffrey. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4395.0s)]
*  It was Jeffrey. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4397.0s)]
*  It was Jeffrey and Prince Andrew. [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4398.0s)]
*  I don't know what the truth is, Andrew. [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4402.0s)]
*  I wish I did. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4404.0s)]
*  Let him come out and talk to people. [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4405.0s)]
*  Let him come out and take hard questions from people. [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4407.0s)]
*  This leak to Axios at the end of the July 4th weekend, let him come out and face the music and say, look, this is what we found. [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4409.0s)]
*  I was surprised. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4416.0s)]
*  Aren't they motivated? [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4418.0s)]
*  I would think they are motivated to prove that the things that they had been saying to the public before they got into office, they should be motivated to prove those things are true. [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4420.0s)]
*  And if they're not true, they should come out and say, yeah, like I misled you. [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4428.0s)]
*  I didn't mean to. [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4432.0s)]
*  But I said the wrong things. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4433.0s)]
*  I just don't like the way this is unfolding. [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4435.0s)]
*  And again, like you, I am a big fan of Dan's and I'm a fan of Cash Patel's. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4437.0s)]
*  I have nothing to say negative about him. [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4442.0s)]
*  But this doesn't sit right. [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4444.0s)]
*  It doesn't taste right. [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4446.0s)]
*  They're going to do it. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4447.0s)]
*  They are going to come out. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4448.0s)]
*  I just don't believe those two guys will say. [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4449.0s)]
*  They're not afraid. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4450.0s)]
*  These are not like cowardly men. [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4451.0s)]
*  They're going to be out there probably this week, I would imagine. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4454.0s)]
*  And I believe there will be a full-fledged vetting. [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4457.0s)]
*  I mean, I was talking to Dan not long ago about coming on with us, maybe both of them, soon. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4460.0s)]
*  I don't think we anticipated July. [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4466.0s)]
*  But I'll definitely ask both of them about it. [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4469.0s)]
*  And I think they'll answer me. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4472.0s)]
*  I don't think they're afraid. [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4473.0s)]
*  I do think it's possible, however, that they've learned more since becoming government administrators that they can't reveal. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4475.0s)]
*  I mean, some information would be classified. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4483.0s)]
*  There are many who believe Jeffrey Epstein and or Ghislaine Maxwell had connections, two examples, the Mossad out of Israel. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4485.0s)]
*  And that it's possible. [[01:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4494.0s)]
*  Now, that's also been debunked. [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4496.0s)]
*  Well, not debunked, but like the they've thrown cold water on that saying it's not true. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4497.0s)]
*  Haven't seen any evidence of that. [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4502.0s)]
*  But I mean, there are possible reasons why they might have to mislead. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4503.0s)]
*  And that we do need to look for. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4508.0s)]
*  I mean, cash was on Joe Rogan in June. [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4510.0s)]
*  It was June 6th. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4513.0s)]
*  And he definitely sounded to me like he knew more than he was revealing. [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4515.0s)]
*  And I thought, OK, it's it's harder when you're actually in charge and you're responsible for maintaining classified briefings and so on. [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4519.0s)]
*  But here he is in South 13 in June. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4527.0s)]
*  But what about the video from the island? [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4529.0s)]
*  Again, we're going to give you everything we can. [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4532.0s)]
*  And people have to remember, we're not going to re-victimize women. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4535.0s)]
*  We're not going to put that shit back out there. [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4540.0s)]
*  It's not happening because then he wins. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4542.0s)]
*  Not doing it. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4543.0s)]
*  You want to hate me for it? [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4544.0s)]
*  Fine. [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4545.0s)]
*  Again, logical play out. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4546.0s)]
*  If there was a video of some guy or gal committing felonies on an island and I'm in charge, don't you think you'd see it? [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4549.0s)]
*  If you have access to it. [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4560.0s)]
*  If I have it. [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4562.0s)]
*  Period. If I have it. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4563.0s)]
*  If I have it. [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4564.0s)]
*  So where else would it be? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4565.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4569.0s)]
*  If you have it. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4570.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4571.0s)]
*  But you can't say that you have it. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4572.0s)]
*  No, we're giving you everything we have. [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4573.0s)]
*  So far. [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4576.0s)]
*  Everything we have so far is that you can't... [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4577.0s)]
*  Have you guys gone over all the video that's available? [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4579.0s)]
*  Yeah, that's what I'm telling you. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4582.0s)]
*  That's what takes so much damn time. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4583.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4585.0s)]
*  And... [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4586.0s)]
*  And is there video from the island? [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4587.0s)]
*  Not of what you want. [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4589.0s)]
*  The people out there have filled the void with can't wait to see X, Y, or Z. [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4591.0s)]
*  Right, speculation. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4598.0s)]
*  Now I understand that you would never re-victimize these women and show this footage. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4599.0s)]
*  But is there footage? [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4605.0s)]
*  Outside of... [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4609.0s)]
*  The only thing I can say right now is... [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4612.0s)]
*  If there was ever... [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4616.0s)]
*  If there was footage of anyone doing anything else, we would have opened a case. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4617.0s)]
*  So he just doesn't sound like himself? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4623.0s)]
*  You can hear him being careful. [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4625.0s)]
*  He's not... [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4627.0s)]
*  Like a lot of those are not fully direct answers. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4628.0s)]
*  He's not volunteering information. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4631.0s)]
*  And you are... [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4633.0s)]
*  You can see Joe Rogan really trying to like kind of... [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4634.0s)]
*  Like pulling teeth trying to get like full answers. [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4636.0s)]
*  So it's clear to me it's just different when you're in charge. [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4640.0s)]
*  Yeah, no, I completely understand that. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4643.0s)]
*  I'm willing to be understanding right down the line, but not where we're standing right now. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4645.0s)]
*  I mean, I'm willing to hear what they have to say. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4650.0s)]
*  And again, like I said, you know, three times. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4653.0s)]
*  I'm fans of these guys. I trust them. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4656.0s)]
*  But I do not think that they are handling this the right way as it stands. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4658.0s)]
*  I do not think that this is the way this information should get out there. [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4662.0s)]
*  And because the abuse of young people by the powerful is so endemic. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4665.0s)]
*  And because the stories never get to the surface somehow. [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4670.0s)]
*  You know, when I was working in Hollywood, these stories would bubble up. [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4673.0s)]
*  They percolate up. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4676.0s)]
*  And you start to see little paragraphs of them in variety, the Hollywood trade paper. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4677.0s)]
*  And then they disappear again. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4681.0s)]
*  They just vanish because Hollywood variety depends on advertising from the Hollywood studios. [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4683.0s)]
*  And they think like, all right, so that just got covered up. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4689.0s)]
*  And it would happen again and again. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4691.0s)]
*  And it happens. You know, we still don't know all the things that happened in the Catholic Church. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4693.0s)]
*  We still don't know all the things that are happening in Britain with the Muslim rape gangs. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4697.0s)]
*  All of these things just seem to get killed somewhere along the line. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4701.0s)]
*  And I guess I would like these two people who I trust and who I believe in to come forward [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4705.0s)]
*  and explain to me bit by bit how exactly they got from, yeah, we're going to release this list to there is no list. [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4710.0s)]
*  How exactly they got to, you know, yeah, we're going to put this woman in prison for 20 years, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4717.0s)]
*  but we're not going to offer her a deal if she'll name some names. [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4721.0s)]
*  How do we get to those places? [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4724.0s)]
*  Fair, all fair questions. Andrew Claven, what a pleasure. [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4726.0s)]
*  Thank you so much. I missed talking to you. I'm glad you came on. Thank you. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4730.0s)]
*  That's great to see you, Megan. Thanks a lot. [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4733.0s)]
*  OK, coming up next, Selena Zito is here. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4735.0s)]
*  We're going to talk to her about the news, and we're also going to get into her new book on being with Trump. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4738.0s)]
*  The day of the Butler rally. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4744.0s)]
*  We're coming up in the one year mark. Remember that? [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4747.0s)]
*  Do you remember where you were when you heard Trump was shot last July? [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4749.0s)]
*  She certainly does. It was within steps of the then candidate. [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4753.0s)]
*  And she's got some incredible stories from the day, which you have not yet heard. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4759.0s)]
*  She's here today. [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4763.0s)]

*  Don't wait. The IRS is cracking down. [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4769.0s)]

*  But there is help. You don't have to handle this alone. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4778.0s)]

*  It was almost one year ago that President Trump survived an assassination attempt at a rally in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4829.0s)]
*  It was on July 13th, 2024, which would be this Sunday. [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4837.0s)]
*  It'll be one year. Do you remember where you were? I do. [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4842.0s)]
*  I remember I was down here at the beach and my then 10-year-old was walking by my phone [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4845.0s)]
*  and saw my phone lighting up like a Christmas tree with messages from my team and saying, [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4850.0s)]
*  Mom, Trump got shot and that feeling of just your stomach dropping, you know, like, no. [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4855.0s)]
*  And then he said in his ear, and I didn't know what to make of that, right? [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4862.0s)]
*  In his ear is bad, like on his earlobe, far less troubling. [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4867.0s)]
*  And the news would come rapid fire after that. I'm sure you remember it, too. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4874.0s)]
*  Well, today we're joined by a reporter who remembers it in especially a cute way. [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4879.0s)]
*  She was literally a couple of feet away from the president that fateful day. [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4883.0s)]
*  She saw and heard the shots fired, the immediate aftermath, the resilience of President Trump and of the crowd. [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4887.0s)]
*  How they how they behaved in this time of panic and violence. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4896.0s)]
*  And it was unlike what you might expect of a typical crowd and unlike what you might expect of a Trump crowd. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4901.0s)]
*  If you read The New York Times exclusively, Selena Zito's new book uncovers how President Trump's messaging changed following that attempt on his life and more. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4906.0s)]
*  It's called Butler, the untold story of the near assassination of Donald Trump and the fight for America's heartland. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4917.0s)]
*  And it's out tomorrow. Go preorder it right now. [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4926.0s)]
*  Trump is endorsing the book, urging everyone to read it. [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4928.0s)]
*  He doesn't talk that much about the assassination attempt. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4932.0s)]
*  He said he was only going to talk about it that one night at the RNC. [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4935.0s)]
*  I think he did it one other time, but he doesn't like talking about it. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4937.0s)]
*  He did to Selena, who lived it with him. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4940.0s)]
*  Selena, welcome back. Great to see you. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4943.0s)]
*  Great to see you. Thanks so much for having me. [[01:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4945.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Congrats on the book. [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4948.0s)]
*  And just what what a scoop. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4950.0s)]
*  I mean, I feel like the reason Selena Zito got this story and was with the president that day and spoke to him for over an hour within 24 hours of it happening is because Selena Zito has made a lifetime out of reporting on events and places and people that few others will. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4953.0s)]
*  The mainstream doesn't. [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4970.0s)]
*  You were in Butler because you knew Butler mattered. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4972.0s)]
*  You were in Pennsylvania because you knew the the back areas of Pennsylvania would determine the next president of the United States in a way. [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4974.0s)]
*  Yes, the mainstream media knew Pennsylvania was important, but you knew the state. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4981.0s)]
*  You knew the towns. [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4985.0s)]
*  You knew the flavor. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4986.0s)]
*  You knew the feeling your families from there. [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4987.0s)]
*  But that's been your M.O. your entire reporting career. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4990.0s)]
*  And I just think like there was in the same way there was divine intervention to save Trump that day. [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4994.0s)]
*  There was something divine about you being steps away and having that front row seat to history. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=4998.0s)]
*  Selena, you're the perfect person to write this book. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5003.0s)]
*  Congrats on the pub. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5006.0s)]
*  And you tell me when you think back on it almost a year later, how do you see it? [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5007.0s)]
*  How do you feel it mattered? [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5013.0s)]
*  Well, first of all, thanks for having me on. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5016.0s)]
*  I feel very honored and to be able to tell this story in a way that I think is very authentic to the people and honors the people of Pennsylvania who were part, you know, they're part of this story, not only that day, but in the days leading up to it and the days after. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5019.0s)]
*  And, you know, when you're a reporter, you don't always expect what you're supposed to do that day to be exactly what happens. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5038.0s)]
*  I wasn't supposed to be standing in the buffer four feet away from the president. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5047.0s)]
*  I wasn't supposed to see the president before he went out there. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5052.0s)]
*  But through a series of like, we're going to do this, Selena, we're not going to do that. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5058.0s)]
*  People will really enjoy having a front row seat to that back and forth about how I ended up there. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5062.0s)]
*  But, you know, I was there for a reason, and I think I was there because I'm supposed to tell this story in a way that is meaningful and nuanced and understands not only Trump, but more importantly, the constituency of people, people that are very rarely seen who placed him into office. [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5069.0s)]
*  As a reporter, I often feel like I straddle two completely different worlds. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5095.0s)]
*  If I go on social media and I watch other or read other journalists and how they were talking about the race that last year, and then I'm on the ground in Pennsylvania and watching something completely different, you know, I think that's part of why I was there and why I ended up being so close. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5101.0s)]
*  When I'll just start like later in the book, just for this first question, you point out that as you wrote into Butler, as you're looking around Butler, Pennsylvania, you actually tried to call attention by to what people were seeing what's happening in the town with the other reporters, the so-called mainstream reporters who refused to look up from their phones. [[01:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5123.0s)]
*  They had zero interest in understanding Butler, Trump supporters, the rally crowd. [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5149.0s)]
*  Really, those people, when I read that piece of the book, I'm like, they were too busy writing orange band bad Trump, Hitler, fascists, right? [[01:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5157.0s)]
*  Like, that's the only narrative they understand the same as they're doing today with respect to what's happening down in Texas. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5164.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5171.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5172.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5173.0s)]
*  So that point you're talking about, it was in Erie, Pennsylvania. [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5174.0s)]
*  I have long argued that Erie, Pennsylvania is the most important county, not just in Pennsylvania, but also in the entire country. [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5176.0s)]
*  As Erie goes, so goes the country in a presidential election. [[01:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5183.0s)]
*  It has been that way for a couple hundred years, right? [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5187.0s)]
*  And we're in Erie. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5190.0s)]
*  JD Vance had been there that day. [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5192.0s)]
*  It was his first visit to Pennsylvania after being named the nominee by President Trump. [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5194.0s)]
*  And he's at this event in this sort of old industrial area. [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5200.0s)]
*  And he gets this massive crowd, right? [[01:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5205.0s)]
*  And there are people lining the streets to see his motorcade. [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5209.0s)]
*  And I'm thinking, you know, this matters. [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5213.0s)]
*  This is huge. [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5216.0s)]
*  This traditionally was a Democrat county. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5217.0s)]
*  If they're coming to see this guy who's even calling, you know, something about cat ladies and there was all kind of weird. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5220.0s)]
*  He's weird. [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5228.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5229.0s)]
*  And I'm pointing out to these journalists because I'm, you know, as a blue collar kid from Western PA, Lake Erie was our beach. [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5230.0s)]
*  Okay. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5239.0s)]
*  That's where we went on vacation. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5240.0s)]
*  So I know Erie really well. [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5242.0s)]
*  I'm pointing out the old GE plan and all these industrial institutions that are gone and trying to show them like that matters, like place matters in this election. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5244.0s)]
*  And I like they're not paying attention to me at all. [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5256.0s)]
*  And it's not about me. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5261.0s)]
*  I was trying to be instructive and they didn't care. [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5263.0s)]
*  They all had their heads down in their phones. [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5267.0s)]
*  And I was so frustrated. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5270.0s)]
*  They probably were writing another childless cat lady article right at that moment. [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5273.0s)]
*  That's weird. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5277.0s)]
*  It couldn't be interrupted. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5278.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5279.0s)]
*  It was about he said something that day. [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5280.0s)]
*  Oh, I know what Jay Van said that day. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5283.0s)]
*  That was the day he said that Harris, he was really angry about Harris saying that she would do nothing different than Joe Biden did when it came to Afghanistan. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5286.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5295.0s)]
*  And and and JD said something about that in strong words. [[01:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5296.0s)]
*  And that's all they wrote about and how terrible he was for framing it that way. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5300.0s)]
*  And I'm like, y'all are missing this race that's going on right in front of you. [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5304.0s)]
*  There are people that are holding up signs and saying, I'm weird, too. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5308.0s)]
*  Nobody else wrote that. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5313.0s)]
*  And you're not getting what's happening. [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5315.0s)]
*  So Trump, a week prior to that, goes to Butler, Pennsylvania. [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5319.0s)]
*  You're there, too. [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5322.0s)]
*  And you write about how there was a joyful crowd like we always saw the Trump rallies, not at all what the media would portray, but like truly joyful celebratory. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5324.0s)]
*  They did not know that Trump was going to win. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5337.0s)]
*  We did not know that. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5339.0s)]
*  It was what we were told by everybody, including me. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5340.0s)]
*  It looked like a very tight, tight race. [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5342.0s)]
*  All the polls suggested tight, tight, tight. [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5344.0s)]
*  But still, they were joyful just to be around him, his messaging. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5346.0s)]
*  They felt seen. [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5349.0s)]
*  They felt heard. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5350.0s)]
*  And then Trump gives the speech. [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5351.0s)]
*  And we've heard this before, but I want you to tell it about how the turning of the head. [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5354.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5359.0s)]
*  And like how unusual it was for him to do that. [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5360.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5364.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5365.0s)]
*  So he goes out. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5366.0s)]
*  If you look at the cover of the book, my daughter actually took that cover. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5368.0s)]
*  And I think that cover is very, very powerful. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5371.0s)]
*  It's symbolic because it shows Trump facing the crowd and the crowd facing back at him. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5374.0s)]
*  That is the transactional relationship that he has with rallygoers. [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5381.0s)]
*  And, Megan, you were in Pittsburgh on the night before you see that. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5386.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5389.0s)]
*  And he never turns his neck away. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5390.0s)]
*  Now, he might turn his body away to face a different side of the rally, different part of the stands, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5394.0s)]
*  but he never turns his head away. [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5400.0s)]
*  Two things happen simultaneously. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5402.0s)]
*  A chart goes down. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5404.0s)]
*  And I remember turning to my daughter and says, what does he think he's Ross Perot? [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5406.0s)]
*  Because he never has a chart. [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5410.0s)]
*  Right. True. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5412.0s)]
*  And then like a split second later, he turns his neck away. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5413.0s)]
*  Again, something he never does. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5417.0s)]
*  Pop, pop, pop, pop. [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5419.0s)]
*  Right over my head. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5421.0s)]
*  I knew exactly what it was. [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5422.0s)]
*  I'm a gun owner. [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5424.0s)]
*  And I knew exactly what what was happening. [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5426.0s)]
*  I saw the blood streak across his face. [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5429.0s)]
*  I saw him. [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5432.0s)]
*  Most importantly, the thing that almost gave me immediate release, [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5433.0s)]
*  little relief was that I saw him get down on his own. [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5437.0s)]
*  And I'm making this mental checklist. [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5442.0s)]
*  I never get down. [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5444.0s)]
*  I'm eventually taken down by a campaign spoke spokesperson [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5445.0s)]
*  because I'm just reporting. Right. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5450.0s)]
*  I have my record. He was trying to protect you. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5453.0s)]
*  Yeah, he was trying to protect me. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5455.0s)]
*  He's a he's a brave young man. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5457.0s)]
*  I will always love him. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5459.0s)]
*  But, you know, he he does not he does not get he's not falling down. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5461.0s)]
*  There are a sea of blue that surround him when the next four shots go off. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5466.0s)]
*  And and I just remember saying, oh, dear God, that podium is not going to protect him. [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5472.0s)]
*  That there's more shots. [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5476.0s)]
*  Please let him be OK. Please let everyone in the stands be OK. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5478.0s)]
*  And I never it never occurred to me to think about myself in that moment. [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5482.0s)]
*  And I'm not saying that like I'm selfless, but there's there's this thing that happens when you're a reporter [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5486.0s)]
*  that you just continue. You have to you have to do your job. [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5492.0s)]
*  And that's what I continue doing. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5496.0s)]
*  And and so, you know, he passes me that they eventually take him past me. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5499.0s)]
*  I'm on I'm like four feet away, four or five feet away. [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5506.0s)]
*  They eventually take him past me. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5509.0s)]
*  And there's some really interesting moments after that in the book. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5512.0s)]
*  But the one thing I thought was so powerful and I'm going to get in so much trouble with my parents for this one. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5515.0s)]
*  Yes, even at sixty five, I worry about getting in trouble with my parents. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5522.0s)]
*  But the next morning, the president calls me. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5526.0s)]
*  I don't know, early. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5530.0s)]
*  And he said, so he said, Salina, this is President Donald Trump. [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5532.0s)]
*  Like, I didn't know it was him. Right. And and he says, are you OK? [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5537.0s)]
*  Is your daughter OK? Is your son son OK? [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5542.0s)]
*  Says them by name, like, I can't even believe he remembers that he's by himself. [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5545.0s)]
*  There's no one with him. So it's not like he has like a little crib sheet. [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5549.0s)]
*  Right. And and he and I and I said, are you bleeping kidding me? [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5553.0s)]
*  You just been shot and you're asking about me. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5558.0s)]
*  And then I'm like, oh, my God, I just scored the president. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5561.0s)]
*  And I got myself really upset. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5564.0s)]
*  He ended up calling me seven times that day. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5567.0s)]
*  We had a very in-depth conversations and people can read it. [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5570.0s)]
*  But I want to go back to the cover of that book and why this moment's important, because I asked him [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5574.0s)]
*  and I asked him, I said, why did you say fight, fight, fight? [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5581.0s)]
*  And I'll never forget this. He goes, well, Selena, I wasn't Donald Trump in that moment. [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5586.0s)]
*  I I was representing the presidency and I have an obligation. [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5590.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to get chills every time I say I just got the chills, too. [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5597.0s)]
*  Yeah, I have an obligation as a former president and maybe potentially president again to show strength, [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5600.0s)]
*  to show people that we are resolved and nothing will hurt us or take us down and we continue on. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5609.0s)]
*  And I have. That's amazing. That that moment. [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5616.0s)]
*  I mean, we we have it here. It is. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5620.0s)]
*  I mean, we've we've talked about the assassination moment. [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5622.0s)]
*  Let's just let's look at the fight, fight, fight moment in South 32. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5625.0s)]
*  Fist up saying fight surrounded by the Secret Service agents. [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5637.0s)]
*  It's it's his incredible combination of like. [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5642.0s)]
*  Yes, he has hubris. Of course, every president does. [[01:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5646.0s)]
*  But but but also understanding how to lead, how to be strong and how to lead what people need in a leader. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5650.0s)]
*  Yeah, we revisited that that question two weeks ago. [[01:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5658.0s)]
*  It'll be it'll be out in my Washington Post story on Friday. [[01:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5663.0s)]
*  Very emotional interview between him and Helen Campatori, the widow of Corey Campatori and myself. [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5667.0s)]
*  And and I asked him again, I said, you know, you told me that he goes, yeah, I did. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5674.0s)]
*  I said, well, because, well, I mean, that's why I'm doing what I'm doing now. [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5681.0s)]
*  That's why I'm going full steam ahead, because I have purpose. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5686.0s)]
*  God's hand was in that moment. [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5690.0s)]
*  And I have an obligation to be the best that I can be for this country. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5693.0s)]
*  And again, I get goosebumps because people have all these different thoughts about who they think President Trump is. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5698.0s)]
*  And as a reporter and trust me, he's gotten mad at me, too, along the way. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5705.0s)]
*  But as a reporter, there is a humanity and empathy in him. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5711.0s)]
*  He always remembers your name, always asked about your children and your grandchildren. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5717.0s)]
*  Was obsessed with your hair, which is fantastic. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5724.0s)]
*  By the way, something funny about Trump, I'm occasionally I do hear from the president in one way, shape or form. [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5726.0s)]
*  And if he calls me, he says the same thing. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5732.0s)]
*  It's your favorite president by far, by far. [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5736.0s)]
*  He's funny. You know, that to me is actually not exactly hubris. [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5743.0s)]
*  It's just funny. It's almost self-deprecating because he's just sort of like, yes, I am. [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5747.0s)]
*  Period. Yes. Yes. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5751.0s)]
*  He's very, very funny. There's a part in the book where he chases me around the green room with hairspray. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5753.0s)]
*  He really wants you to try hairspray because he loves your hair. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5759.0s)]
*  I can't believe you don't need hairspray. Yeah. Mr. President, my hair is big enough. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5762.0s)]
*  I do not need hairspray. [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5766.0s)]
*  And last week or two weeks ago when I was I wrote on Air Force One. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5768.0s)]
*  Now, let me tell you, as a kid that grew up on the wrong side of the tracks, who went to who has been a waitress and worked in a sewage treatment plant and had been a cafeteria lady. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5774.0s)]
*  Right. Like I've not exactly had this life of privilege. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5785.0s)]
*  And to be on Air Force One is like, oh, my God, who am I? [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5788.0s)]
*  But as we're going from Air Force One into the beast, which is the vehicle that the president uses, he asked me if I want to dye a coke. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5792.0s)]
*  And I scrunched my face. I do not have a poker face. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5802.0s)]
*  Obviously, if anybody's watching this, they can see that. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5805.0s)]
*  And he goes, wait, you don't like coke? I'm like, no, I don't like pop because pop. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5808.0s)]
*  And so he couldn't believe I didn't like it because you try to like it. It's the best coke ever. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5814.0s)]
*  It's amazing. It's amazing. He's as healthy as he is at his age, subsisting on McDonald's Diet Coke and Hershey chocolate bars. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5819.0s)]
*  Keep going. Yeah. And so I tried it. No poker face. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5826.0s)]
*  I made a face and goes, I can't believe you don't like coke. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5831.0s)]
*  So but, you know, I think it's so interesting you talk to him seven days, sorry, seven times the day after the shooting and for at least 10 minutes of time. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5836.0s)]
*  To me, that tells me he needed to talk to you like he he must have needed to talk to people who were there, who are rational, who saw it, who had a perspective on it. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5846.0s)]
*  And you write something in the book to the effect of I gave him the time and space to figure it out for himself. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5858.0s)]
*  Like what the sort of the wisdom that would come from what had happened to him, because I'm sure it wasn't instantaneous. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5865.0s)]
*  I'm sure it did take a while. We saw that a little at the RNC, which happened a week later. [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5873.0s)]
*  He still had the bandage on his ear where, you know, he was a little meandering in the speech, but you could see he was openly grappling with like, was I saved? [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5877.0s)]
*  You know, like maybe something extraordinary is happening with me. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5887.0s)]
*  Maybe I actually am. I believe Trump believes in God. [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5891.0s)]
*  I don't think is particularly religious, but I do think that that experience started to reframe his own purpose here for him. [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5894.0s)]
*  Yes. You were part of that in the early, early day. [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5902.0s)]
*  Yeah. And that's why I decided I know other journalists would push him to talk and push him to say things, but I didn't think that was right. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5905.0s)]
*  I knew he was going through something and I thought it was important for him to be able to figure that out while we had that conversation. [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5916.0s)]
*  And there is this has been very humbling for him. [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5924.0s)]
*  The death of Corey has had a huge impact on him. [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5928.0s)]
*  And you'll find that throughout the book. [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5932.0s)]
*  But also purpose and God have really had a spiritual impact on him in a way that I don't think people truly understand, but they can see in the way he is leading his presidency. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5935.0s)]
*  The American dream has changed. [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5950.0s)]
*  Forget the white picket fence. For most Americans, the real dream is getting out of debt. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5954.0s)]
*  If you are feeling the pressure from rising prices, mounting credit card debt, and you're just trying to stay afloat, I want you to know there could be a way out with done with debt. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5958.0s)]
*  They've got one goal. Break you free from debt permanently. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5967.0s)]
*  They're not pushing loans or bankruptcy. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5971.0s)]
*  Instead, they're tough negotiators go straight to your creditors, slashing what you owe, wiping out interest and eliminating penalties. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5973.0s)]
*  And the best part, most clients see more money in their pocket in the first month. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5980.0s)]
*  You've worked too hard to let debt steal your future with done with debt. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5985.0s)]
*  Your dream of being debt free could be possible. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5989.0s)]
*  Visit done with debt dot com and speak with one of their experts. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=5992.0s)]

*  Done with debt dot com. [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6002.0s)]
*  I'm not supposed to be here tonight. [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6004.0s)]
*  Not supposed to be here. [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6007.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6028.0s)]
*  But I'm not. [[01:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6031.0s)]
*  I was there that night. My family was there. [[01:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6034.0s)]
*  It was very moving. You could see a man still trying to still really he was still. [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6037.0s)]
*  I mean, Trump is a human. [[01:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6042.0s)]
*  You know, he has emotions. [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6044.0s)]
*  He has fri altis just like the rest of us, even though he doesn't acknowledge them. [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6046.0s)]
*  There was a picture that made national news the other day on the Daily Mail, catching him with reading glasses on. [[01:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6049.0s)]
*  And they pointed out you never see Trump with reading glasses on. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6054.0s)]
*  He doesn't. You know, he likes to project strength and robustness, which he has. [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6057.0s)]
*  He does. I'm already using reading glasses and I'm much younger than Donald Trump. [[01:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6063.0s)]
*  But that's just just how he's built. [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6068.0s)]
*  So you can see it was an interesting moment, Selena, to watch him starting to come to terms with it. [[01:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6070.0s)]
*  Like, I literally almost lost my life like seven days ago. [[01:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6075.0s)]
*  And then you point out he then he did come to terms with it. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6079.0s)]
*  And here he is sounding more sure at the actual inauguration post the victory. [[01:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6083.0s)]
*  That's SOT 37. [[01:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6088.0s)]
*  Just a few months ago in a beautiful Pennsylvania field, an assassin's bullet ripped through my ear. [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6090.0s)]
*  But I felt then and believe even more so now that my life was saved for a reason. [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6098.0s)]
*  I was saved by God to make America great again. [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6104.0s)]
*  Standing ovation inside the capital of everyone except for the Democrats. [[01:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6109.0s)]
*  How do you think it's affected him as president? [[01:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6124.0s)]
*  Like, what do you see in him that you think is related to this event? [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6126.0s)]
*  He's just going so. So this is technically a lame duck presidency at this point, right? [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6133.0s)]
*  You would never think that he is so full charged and he is so determined to to fix and sort of undo not only what Biden has done, [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6139.0s)]
*  but what has been done before by past presidents, Republicans and Democrats alike. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6154.0s)]
*  And he is he is not putting the brake pedals on. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6159.0s)]
*  And it's very unlike 2017. [[01:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6163.0s)]
*  Twenty seventeen was like, oh, God, now I'm here. [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6167.0s)]
*  And with, you know, these people are all telling me what to do. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6170.0s)]
*  And he's like, I'm doing what I in my gut I know is right. [[01:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6173.0s)]
*  Yeah. Watching his face, Megan, then in that clip you just showed, [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6177.0s)]
*  I remember looking at his face that night and saying, oh, yeah, [[01:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6182.0s)]
*  I know that face. I have that face in the morning right now because I don't know what just happened. [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6188.0s)]
*  And I don't know what I'm supposed to do. [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6194.0s)]
*  But I feel as though I'm called to do something bigger, bigger than self. [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6196.0s)]
*  Right. You know, and not that I do anything big, but it ended up being this book. [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6201.0s)]
*  And I was reluctant initially to do this book. [[01:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6207.0s)]
*  But, you know, I realize it was an important book and it's not just about what happened that day. [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6211.0s)]
*  It's what happened before we find out that President Trump isn't the only president to be shot at in Butler. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6218.0s)]
*  And it makes us very reflective as to how different the country would be had George Washington died that day. [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6228.0s)]
*  And it has to make us think about how reflective we should be about President Trump had died that day. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6235.0s)]
*  There would be steelworkers that wouldn't have a job anymore. [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6240.0s)]
*  There will be a flood of people because because Harris and Biden were both against that that that deal. [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6243.0s)]
*  There would be people still flooding across our border. [[01:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6250.0s)]
*  There there would be people in western North Carolina that never saw any help or hope after those devastating floods that hit that area in September of twenty twenty four. [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6253.0s)]
*  Right. And the continual help from from FEMA. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6267.0s)]
*  There would have been no no no annihilation of the Iran's nuclear capabilities. [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6270.0s)]
*  There would be no Israel and Iran deal. [[01:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6276.0s)]
*  The world would look very different in just the same way that the world would look very, very different had George Washington died in Butler in 1754. [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6279.0s)]
*  We have to think about the way Trump governs now. [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6290.0s)]
*  So not only you point out, yes, this time around, he wanted competent but loyal. [[01:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6293.0s)]
*  You know, first time around, I think he just went for what looked like competent. [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6298.0s)]
*  He didn't factor in loyalty and he paid a price for it this time around. [[01:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6301.0s)]
*  I think, yes, he learned from term one. [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6305.0s)]
*  But also, I think when you've almost been killed, you probably do have a greater appreciation for people who are loyal to you, who you can trust, who are going to have your best interests, [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6308.0s)]
*  your family's best interests and who are going to be totally aligned with your mission. [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6318.0s)]
*  Like now you're determined and you can't have anybody getting in your way. [[01:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6321.0s)]
*  And then there's there's a certain grandiosity about what Trump does. [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6325.0s)]
*  But I it's been magnificent. [[01:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6330.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, Gazira, like what? [[01:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6332.0s)]
*  Mara Gaza. What do you want to what? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6336.0s)]
*  Now, that's probably not going to happen. Let's get real. [[01:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6339.0s)]
*  But what other American president would even think to say, I'll take it on? [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6341.0s)]
*  I actually think I might be able to fix it. [[01:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6346.0s)]
*  Like, it's incredible. [[01:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6348.0s)]
*  And or even like, you know, Greenland says no, but I say yes. [[01:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6350.0s)]
*  Like, it actually might happen or result in some sort of a compromise. [[01:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6355.0s)]
*  You know, peace in the Middle East. [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6359.0s)]
*  I'm going to try to settle the Russia thing in a day. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6361.0s)]
*  You realize you can do that. But he's just taken on everything, things that are politically toxic, that most normal politicians wouldn't want to touch with a 10 foot pole because they don't have to. [[01:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6363.0s)]
*  It's like somebody else's problem. I don't have to solve it. [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6374.0s)]
*  I got my own problems. Trump is like, I think I can fix it. [[01:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6376.0s)]
*  I think I have that solution. I think we can be friends with the new Al Qaeda linked runners of Syria. [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6380.0s)]
*  I think I can renew hope and optimism and great relations with the Saudis. [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6385.0s)]
*  Like, there's nothing he says. Yeah, I can't. [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6390.0s)]
*  You're exactly right. [[01:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6392.0s)]
*  And I think there would have been 70 percent of that after surviving all the lawfare. [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6395.0s)]
*  Right. There would have been an element of him that would be I bow in a China shop and yes, I'm breaking all the China and we're going to get new China. [[01:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6401.0s)]
*  Right. But but you tell you add on the assassination attempt, you add on questioning purpose and aspiration. [[01:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6409.0s)]
*  Right. Part of something bigger than self. [[01:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6421.0s)]
*  And all of a sudden you get the Trump 2025 and he is going to be the most consequential president in not just my lifetime since FDR. [[01:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6424.0s)]
*  Just think about this. He's going to own a space and time that stretches out at least 15 years where he was the dominant figure in American politics. [[01:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6438.0s)]
*  That is unprecedented. And and I don't know that we'll ever see anything like this again in our lifetimes. [[01:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6448.0s)]
*  Right. It was my parents who were children when FDR was was president. [[01:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6455.0s)]
*  But, you know, that was what 70, 80 years ago. [[01:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6460.0s)]
*  It took that long for another president to be that dominant in our country and strong. [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6464.0s)]
*  Yes. He was he was built for this moment. [[01:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6470.0s)]
*  You write and we and it was a good refresher about some of the things that we learned this time last year about how he'd been. [[01:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6475.0s)]
*  He went down and then the Secret Service was all over him and they hit him so hard. [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6481.0s)]
*  I mean, in trying to protect him that they knocked him right out of his shoes. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6485.0s)]
*  I had forgotten that. And you write about how you you heard him. [[01:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6489.0s)]
*  And even in that moment, it's really kind of the explanation, I think, for why he went back up and was able to do the fight because remember, we're all like, I said, what's he doing? [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6493.0s)]
*  I said, what's he doing back up? Get down. [[01:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6503.0s)]
*  Like, I know why he did it. But like, you are also thinking, no, get down. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6505.0s)]
*  You don't know if the threat has been neutralized. [[01:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6509.0s)]
*  But initially he was like, get my damn shoes back. [[01:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6511.0s)]
*  That's another thing like Trump. He didn't want to seem be seen without his shoes. [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6516.0s)]
*  He's conscious of what the American people need. [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6520.0s)]
*  They need to see a strong leader, not somebody walking around in his sock feet, not somebody with the reading glasses all the time. [[01:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6522.0s)]
*  Somebody who says fight, even when he might get shot, he doesn't know for sure it's been neutralized. [[01:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6529.0s)]
*  You saw that all unfold in a second. [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6535.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it's not even just about personal image, which is I think is such an important nuance. [[01:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6537.0s)]
*  Right. Yes, it is about him. [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6543.0s)]
*  But also he has this really granular understanding of the presidency needs to look strong, feel strong, feel robust, feel resolute. [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6546.0s)]
*  That he believes that is his obligation in this position. [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6557.0s)]
*  And that is what he did in that moment. [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6561.0s)]
*  And that's what he does every day. [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6564.0s)]
*  Yeah, it's like all of the seams come together. [[01:49:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6567.0s)]
*  I'm going to show you a video on that in just one second. [[01:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6571.0s)]
*  When you read the book, again, it's called Butler, the Untold Story by Selena Zito. [[01:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6573.0s)]
*  Couple of the things I want to hit on that are very interesting. [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6579.0s)]
*  Thomas Crooks. [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6583.0s)]
*  Why don't we know more? [[01:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6586.0s)]
*  Where are the in-depth pieces about him? [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6588.0s)]
*  We know more about Lee Harvey Oswald than we do about this guy. [[01:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6591.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6595.0s)]
*  Yeah, part of that is, and trust me, it wasn't for a lack of trying on my part. [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6597.0s)]
*  Part of it is unlike most young people, he didn't really leave a social media footprint. [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6601.0s)]
*  There wasn't anything there. [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6607.0s)]
*  He didn't tweet. [[01:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6609.0s)]
*  He didn't have a blog. [[01:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6610.0s)]
*  He didn't have MySpace, right? [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6611.0s)]
*  He didn't have anything. [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6613.0s)]
*  He's a very introverted young man. [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6614.0s)]
*  And seemed to be fine until about six months before and then had a complete mental breakdown. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6616.0s)]
*  But we don't know the details of it. [[01:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6622.0s)]
*  I don't know that he was particularly a political. [[01:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6624.0s)]
*  I don't know if this was because he wanted to get Trump. [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6628.0s)]
*  I think he wanted this attention. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6632.0s)]
*  He craved being this historical figure, not a good historical figure, but a historical so people would never forget his name again. [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6636.0s)]
*  Well, they will. [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6644.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6646.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6648.0s)]
*  I mean, his life was so lonely that when I went over from the Clareton Sportsman Club, when I went over the sports club, I was so happy. [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6650.0s)]
*  I mean, I remember when I went over from the Clareton Sportsman Club when I went over the log of when he went to the gun club, it was every day. [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6660.0s)]
*  But it was also Thanksgiving and Christmas and Valentine's Day, days you're supposed to be with your family or friends or loved ones. [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6670.0s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6677.0s)]
*  So why do you think we don't know more? [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6679.0s)]
*  Because a lot of people think it's because he was being paid by Ukraine or he was Iranian backed, you know, that there's an international conspiracy and it's been hushed up. [[01:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6683.0s)]
*  I mean, I would suggest your book tells a different story and it's something much more practical about why we don't know more. [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6692.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6698.0s)]
*  Well, his family lawyered up. [[01:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6699.0s)]
*  We don't we don't have any access to get any information about him, at least not now. [[01:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6702.0s)]
*  I don't know whenever we will get it. [[01:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6709.0s)]
*  I'm still waiting to hear about the Las Vegas shooter. [[01:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6712.0s)]
*  And and so I don't you know, I pushed as hard as I could until I knew I'm hitting a brick wall and I've got a rest of a book to write. [[01:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6715.0s)]
*  And maybe someone much better investigative journalism can get in that. [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6726.0s)]
*  I couldn't get past the brick wall. [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6731.0s)]
*  I also think it's the point you raised about local news is going away. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6733.0s)]
*  You know, for all of our ripping on how biased the news media is, nine times out of 10, we're talking about the national media. [[01:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6737.0s)]
*  Yes. [[01:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6743.0s)]
*  The local news, they're not all focused on politics. [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6744.0s)]
*  They're mostly not focused on politics. [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6747.0s)]
*  They're mostly focused on crime and education and more local stories. [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6749.0s)]
*  And they're really important. [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6753.0s)]
*  They're important. [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6754.0s)]
*  They're far more important in many ways to the ways we actually live. [[01:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6755.0s)]
*  And they're drying up. [[01:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6758.0s)]
*  This is something I'm against. [[01:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6759.0s)]
*  They're drying up from coast to coast. [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6760.0s)]
*  And this is exactly the kind of story that they would normally have had, you know, every single news organization in town on. [[01:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6762.0s)]
*  But, you know, Pennsylvania and Butler are not immune to these national trends either. [[01:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6769.0s)]
*  Yeah, there's news deserts everywhere and they don't have the facility. [[01:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6774.0s)]
*  They don't have the the the reporters that can do this. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6778.0s)]
*  And so that that is the challenge. [[01:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6782.0s)]
*  Speaking of reporters and the national level anyway, in their cozy relationship with the Democrats, you have very interesting information in this book, [[01:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6785.0s)]
*  Butler, The Untold Story by Selena Zito, about what a bomb the Harris Walls campaign was when they did come to Pennsylvania, [[01:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6795.0s)]
*  which they knew full well was the most important state in the union. [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6806.0s)]
*  They're all important, but the swing states are most important in Pennsylvania, the biggest, most swingy of all. [[01:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6811.0s)]
*  And it was just a very good window into how inept they were, notwithstanding the boatloads of money that were being thrown at them. [[01:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6816.0s)]
*  Could you explain? [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6824.0s)]
*  They they just made that. [[01:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6826.0s)]
*  I mean, she spent an unbelievable amount of time in Pittsburgh and nobody ever saw her. [[01:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6828.0s)]
*  If they did see her, she had an event where the all the events were closed. [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6833.0s)]
*  It was only people that they wanted to come to their events. [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6837.0s)]
*  It wasn't people that they didn't open up for people to be curious for people to see. [[01:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6840.0s)]
*  You members, you're right. [[01:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6846.0s)]
*  Oh, yeah. Yeah. [[01:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6848.0s)]
*  They were all, you know. [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6849.0s)]
*  Yeah. And it wasn't like labor unions. [[01:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6851.0s)]
*  It was a social justice union. [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6853.0s)]
*  And so it was so cautious. [[01:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6855.0s)]
*  It was so poorly run. [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6858.0s)]
*  There were opportunities for her to to to be able to grow a coalition. [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6859.0s)]
*  And none of that was done. [[01:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6867.0s)]
*  Hmm. You know, and then on the other hand, you have Trump out there glad handing with the people nonstop, understand talking their talk. [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6868.0s)]
*  You know, it does does remind me of the story that we kicked off our show today when you weren't here yet. [[01:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6876.0s)]
*  But we just touched on it briefly. [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6882.0s)]
*  What happened with the Venezuelan gang members out in Aurora, Colorado? [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6884.0s)]
*  You know, Trump was touting this story because they're trend to Aragua members and they were committing crime and taking over apartment complexes in Aurora. [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6888.0s)]
*  And the mainstream media dumped on this story just as fast as humanly possible. [[01:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6896.0s)]
*  It's not happening. [[01:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6901.0s)]
*  It's a lie. [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6902.0s)]
*  Over and over. [[01:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6903.0s)]
*  The New York Times. [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6904.0s)]
*  It's a lie. [[01:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6905.0s)]
*  It's a lie. [[01:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6906.0s)]
*  And even now, the New York Times has been forced to admit it's true. [[01:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6907.0s)]
*  They're they are taking over buildings. [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6912.0s)]
*  They are killing and committing violent felonies against Americans out there. [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6915.0s)]
*  But there'll be no apology. [[01:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6920.0s)]
*  There'll be no maya culpa. [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6922.0s)]
*  All these political, political fact, fact checks we saw of Trump after that debate on ABC News where he raised this, they tried to say it's not happening. [[01:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6923.0s)]
*  They're not going to go back and apologize to him, Selena. [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6931.0s)]
*  But that's the way the news operates these days. [[01:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6933.0s)]
*  It's so frustrating as a reporter. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6936.0s)]
*  It really is very frustrating to see how these things are are run, to see the bias in them and to see no accountability when you get the story wrong. [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6939.0s)]
*  If I get a story wrong, I'll be like, I got this wrong. [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6951.0s)]
*  Right. [[01:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6954.0s)]
*  Like I, you know, I miss this. [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6955.0s)]
*  Mostly you miss things. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6957.0s)]
*  And if you can't admit that, then then you're not good at your job. [[01:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6959.0s)]
*  Well, I think that's fair to say about the New York Times on any story in which bias can affect them. [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6964.0s)]
*  It does. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6972.0s)]
*  And they're not reliable. [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6974.0s)]
*  OK, the book again is called Butler, the untold story of the near assassination of Donald Trump and the fight for America's heartland. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6975.0s)]
*  It is by the one and only Selena Zito, who you can trust, unlike all those mainstreamers. [[01:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6983.0s)]
*  Go and get it now. [[01:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6989.0s)]
*  Support her. [[01:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6990.0s)]
*  Let's show the New York Times that they will have to put Selena on the bestseller's list, whether they want to do it or not. [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6991.0s)]
*  Great to see you, my friend. [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6997.0s)]
*  Great reporting. [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=6999.0s)]
*  Thanks, Megan. [[01:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7000.0s)]
*  Thank you. Bye bye. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7001.0s)]
*  All the best. [[01:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7002.0s)]
*  Wow. [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7003.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7004.0s)]
*  I can't believe it's been almost a year. [[01:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7005.0s)]
*  Thanks to all of you for listening and we will see you again tomorrow. [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvTJtyRsxjo&t=7006.0s)]
