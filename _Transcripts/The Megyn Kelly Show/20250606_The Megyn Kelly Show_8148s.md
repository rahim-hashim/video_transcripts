Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Ben Shapiro, host of "The Ben Shapiro Show,” to discuss the ongoing nuclear social media war between Elon Musk and President Trump, what Musk’s real role was in Trump’s 2024 victory, the way the left and the right are reacting to it, the real reason Elon vs. Trump went nuclear related to NASA, how the Big Beautiful Bill is still going to be passed, the leftist late night comedians loving the Mean Girls fight, how the snob Democrats continue to push insane illegal immigration arguments, how some are saying all illegal immigrants should receive free healthcare, and more. Then Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova, hosts of "Red Scare," join to discuss whether Elon Musk flew too close to the sun with Trump, breaking down the feud, the insane leftist socialist who is running for mayor in NYC might actually win, his corny and performative ads, how he would continue to ruin the city, his odd backstory, Jon Hamm’s new Apple show where he snacks on the Eucharist after breaking into a church, how Hollywood continues to bash Catholicism and use it as PR, the reality of fat-shaming vs. staying fit, and more.

# What's Behind the Elon vs. Trump Drama, and Insane Leftist Arguments, with Ben Shapiro and Red Scare
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. It's the story that everyone's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=0.0s)]
*  talking about. I mean, everyone. Elon Musk versus Donald Trump. Let me give you the background on [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4.24s)]
*  it and then I'll give you my take on it. This started when we were on the air yesterday, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=9.68s)]
*  but it escalated quickly after we said goodbye. President Trump writing on True Social that he [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=13.76s)]
*  asked Elon to leave the administration. That's news. His special governmental employee status [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=18.8s)]
*  had expired, but it can be renewed. It goes for 130 days. It could be renewed, renewed, renewed. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=25.6s)]
*  That's what they did with Anita Dunn. In any event, he's now saying he asked Elon to leave [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=29.44s)]
*  because he said he was, quote, wearing thin. Peter Ducey at Fox News reporting this morning [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=34.160000000000004s)]
*  that same news and saying it had been going on for about a month, about a month prior to all this, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=39.04s)]
*  that he'd been, quote, wearing thin and that Musk went, quote, crazy, said Trump, when Trump took [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=43.28s)]
*  away the electric vehicle mandate. Trump then threatening to cancel government contracts [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=49.44s)]
*  that Musk has his companies have with the government. Musk responding by claiming Trump [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=54.879999999999995s)]
*  is in the Epstein files. Have a nice day. G D J T. He wrote the world's richest man. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=61.04s)]
*  That would be Elon next claiming that he was decommissioning space X dragon spacecraft. That [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=68.39999999999999s)]
*  was the one that just rescued those astronauts off of the international space station. And by the way, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=75.36s)]
*  right now it's our only means of getting crew and cargo up to the ISS and we have three [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=80.48s)]
*  astronauts up there right now. So it's kind of like an oh shit moment for them. Like, oh, my ride [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=87.44s)]
*  just got canceled. But then some obscure Twitter account said, why don't you quote, cool down [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=92.4s)]
*  and don't do this. And Elon said, oh, okay, we won't decommission dragon. Now, I mean, [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=99.04s)]
*  obviously, he was just looking for something that this guy did not convince him. He shot off a [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=105.2s)]
*  threat in his anger and regretted it moments thereafter. There's no way Elon's leaving the [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=111.44s)]
*  three American astronauts stranded up there at the ISS over a dispute with Donald Trump. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=116.88000000000001s)]
*  All of this happening after months of the pair praising each other over and over and over and over [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=122.72s)]
*  is rocket company is the only reason we can now send American astronauts into space. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=128.4s)]
*  Come here. Take over. Yes. Take as you can see, I'm not just mag. I'm dark mag. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  Tell you, we have a new star. A star is born. Elon. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=142.0s)]
*  You want to love the double half. But he's the only one that can do that. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=149.04s)]
*  Where were you? Well, this person, they say I wear a lot of hats. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=153.83999999999997s)]
*  Even my hat has a hat. I mean, look, in terms of imagination, I think I have a great imagination. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=161.11999999999998s)]
*  Who else but this guy would design this guy to give him credit, become one of your best friends. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=169.6s)]
*  He's working for free for you. Well, I love the president. I just want to be clear about that. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=174.16s)]
*  I don't care about that. I know. I love the president. I love the president. I think I think [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=178.56s)]
*  President Trump is a good man. And he's, you know, that's the way he said that, you know, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=182.32s)]
*  something nice about it. You can almost if you listen carefully here, Barbara Streisand's the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=188.48s)]
*  way we were running underneath that montage of sound. Memories amid rumors that Musk and Trump [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=194.64s)]
*  would talk over the phone today and put this whole thing to bed. Trump telling multiple reporters he [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=204.56s)]
*  has no interest in speaking with Musk, shrugging off the feud and saying he is totally focused on [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=209.84s)]
*  policy. Let me tell you what I think is happening here. You have two giant egos. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=217.76s)]
*  It's like Godzilla versus King Kong. There's a high entertainment value in watching it happen. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=224.16s)]
*  I know some people are upset by it. I'm not upset by it actually at all. I don't think it hurts [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  anything or anybody on the right. I really don't. I think it's just two massive egos [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=235.68s)]
*  doing battle like brawling. And Trump let Elon go out there and pound the big beautiful bill [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=240.88s)]
*  for a while. And then the criticism got a little sharper and a little sharper. And Trump, you know, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=248.08s)]
*  of course he's going to eventually have enough of that. So he did. He brushed back and said, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=253.68s)]
*  you're just mad about the EV subsidies being taken out. And then Elon went like Defcon one on him and [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=257.92s)]
*  said that he was in the Epstein files, which literally nobody believes because how on earth [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=264.48s)]
*  would there be a Democrat White House that didn't reveal that Trump was, what does it even mean in [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=270.16s)]
*  the Epstein files in some nefarious way? I mean, I'm sure he means more than just in Jeffrey Epstein's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=277.6s)]
*  black book because we knew that Trump and Epstein knew each other. That's not news. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=282.40000000000003s)]
*  So to suggest he's in the files means like what he's a pedophile, he's a pervert. He's like a Prince [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=286.8s)]
*  Andrew who had sex with a 17 year old. Bullshit. There's no way that Biden's administration would [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=293.04s)]
*  have kept that a secret. He was running against Trump. He was running against Trump. So that's not [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=300.40000000000003s)]
*  true. And then Trump said, all right, I'm going to cancel your government contracts back and forth. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  And Elon doesn't really want his SpaceX program and it's helped to NASA to be canceled. So he saw [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=313.76s)]
*  the re- so there's, I don't know, it was kind of bound to happen. We all knew it was going to happen. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=319.44s)]
*  No one's really the worse off. Trump's certainly not the worse off. There was a poll out just this [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=325.2s)]
*  morning, interactive polling showing everybody sided with Trump. All the Republicans have sided [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=329.36s)]
*  with Trump, not with Elon. Trump had like 72% of Republicans saying they're with him. Only 6% said [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=335.84000000000003s)]
*  they're with Elon. Democrats hate them both. So where has this gotten us? Trump's not hurt. The [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  big, beautiful bill will pass. Elon's already unpopular, maybe slightly more unpopular with [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=349.12s)]
*  some today. No government contracts are canceled. Trump's not in the Epstein book in any meaningful [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=355.04s)]
*  way. And we just watched the King Kong guerrilla fight, which was pretty entertaining. That's my [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=361.52s)]
*  take. Ben Shapiro is here with his. He's the Daily Wire co-founder and host of the Ben Shapiro Show, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=368.08s)]
*  and author of the forthcoming book, Lions and Scavengers, the true story of America. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=372.96s)]
*  Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook, and X. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=380.8s)]
*  This administration is working very hard to try and fix this country. But while they're focused [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=387.2s)]
*  on fixing the country, they can't fix your personal finances. That's really up to you. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=392.88s)]
*  That's why thousands of Americans are turning to birch gold. In the past 12 months, the value of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=398.64s)]
*  gold has risen by 30%. Think about that. How's your stock market investment doing? Has it gone up 30% [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=403.68s)]
*  if you made 30% on your money? And demand is strong and it's growing. While reports are that [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=412.56s)]
*  the BRICS nations are actively working to challenge the US dollar as the world's reserve currency. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=418.88s)]
*  That's not great. In other uncertain times, gold has offered peace of mind. And in these uncertain [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=424.24s)]
*  times, it does the same. Birch gold makes it incredibly easy to convert your existing IRA or [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=430.72s)]
*  401k into a tax sheltered IRA backed by physical gold. Or if you prefer, you can buy gold to store [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=436.40000000000003s)]
*  in your own home safe. Just text MK to the number 989898 and birch gold will send you a free info [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=443.6s)]
*  kit on gold. There's no obligation, only useful information. With an A plus rating with the Better [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=450.96s)]
*  Business Bureau and tens of thousands of happy customers, take control of protecting your [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=457.2s)]
*  savings today. Text MK to the number 989898. Ben, welcome back. All right, so dying to hear your [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=461.35999999999996s)]
*  thoughts on it. Well, I mean, I'm pretty much with you. Wildly entertaining, right? It's King Kong [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=468.88s)]
*  versus Godzilla. And watching the two of them smack each other is definitely high on the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=473.84s)]
*  entertainment scale. Do I think it has any real lasting impact on the Republican Party? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=478.88s)]
*  Not really. I think that there was always a sort of awkward alliance between the tech bro right [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=482.96s)]
*  and the blue collar populist right. And I think that this has exposed some of those fishers for [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=487.6s)]
*  sure, because you can see people who are sort of stuck in the middle and feel awkwardly stuck [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=492.24s)]
*  in the middle of that. Do they side with Elon or do they side with Trump? Who's this influencer [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=496.24s)]
*  going to side with? And so there's a lot of sort of entertainment weekly drama happening in the [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=501.36s)]
*  political sphere, and that's entertaining. But as far as sort of the broader coalitional point, [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=505.2s)]
*  is the big, beautiful bill going to pass? The answer is yes. Is SpaceX going to stop providing [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=510.08s)]
*  services to the United States government? The answer is no, there is no substitute for SpaceX [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=514.64s)]
*  for the United States government. Blue Origin isn't ready. There's no real alternative. So with [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=519.04s)]
*  all of that said, has this shakeout? It might shake out in terms of kind of the personalities [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=522.96s)]
*  at play. And if Elon is outside the administration sounding off on particular policy matters, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=528.08s)]
*  President Trump goes by his gut and he also tends to be quite reactive. So if Elon, for example, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=532.64s)]
*  comes out in favor of one particular policy, you could see the president sort of come out in [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=537.36s)]
*  reverse of that policy. Just to spite Elon, you could see more splits inside the Republican [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=541.28s)]
*  Party in congressional elections. Maybe Elon doesn't want to be involved in congressional [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=547.04s)]
*  elections in 2026. And so what you see is less money in those congressional elections from [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=550.3199999999999s)]
*  the Elon part of the aisle. And again, you will see some strains emerge when it comes to, I think, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=556.08s)]
*  particular political figures. The one that comes to mind here the most is the vice president, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=561.68s)]
*  who of course has one foot in Silicon Valley and one foot in blue collar Appalachia and sort of is [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=565.12s)]
*  getting torn down the middle here a little bit, just in terms of who is he loyal to, which side [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=569.92s)]
*  does he like. But in the end, does it really make any large scale difference for the American voter? [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=575.1999999999999s)]
*  Not really. I think it's just more dramatic and entertainment than anything else. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=579.28s)]
*  I think JD Vance is not torn. I mean, he only spent a couple years with Peter Thiel out there [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=583.8399999999999s)]
*  and did not have a positive experience. Nothing against Peter, but just he hated San Francisco. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=588.96s)]
*  He hated being in tech. And his loyalties are obviously to Trump, as are the Republican parties. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=593.44s)]
*  What Elon, I think, is starting to realize is while his money can make a difference, [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=599.6800000000001s)]
*  it definitely can make a couple points of a difference in a certain political race here [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=605.2800000000001s)]
*  or there. Not across the board. We saw it not work in Wisconsin on that Supreme Court election. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=609.9200000000001s)]
*  The real person with influence is Donald Trump. And the person with the party loyalty is Donald [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=616.64s)]
*  Trump. Donald Trump took a bullet for the country and the party. And everybody watched that heroic [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=621.3599999999999s)]
*  moment. He's been through hell and back with these litigations against him and criminal trials against [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=627.04s)]
*  him. He's earned the love and loyalty of the Republican party in particular in a way I don't [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  know that anybody ever will again. I really do. I just feel like he's been through so much. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  It's just there's no if it's between so and so and Donald Trump, Donald Trump is going to win, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=644.24s)]
*  even if they're Elon Musk. The thing about Elon is, I think I speak for many when I say [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=650.3199999999999s)]
*  everybody's grateful to him. The biggest thing he did to influence the election was buy X [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=654.64s)]
*  and restore free speech in America. But you cannot take on Trump politically with the right. You'll [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=658.9599999999999s)]
*  lose. Well, I mean, I think that's true. I do think that there's one other thing that that Elon [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=666.64s)]
*  did that's sort of fascinating. And that is he did, in fact, open Silicon Valley to the idea of [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=671.36s)]
*  publicly expressing support for Trump. And that was not a minor thing in terms of sort of the [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=675.76s)]
*  overall cultural acceptance of President Trump. So what do you want did by being a major tech [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=680.48s)]
*  figure and saying, I'm not only supporting President Trump, I'm going to go campaign for [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=686.24s)]
*  President Trump. And then suddenly you have Zuckerberg saying, you know, that's a brave guy, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=689.76s)]
*  President Trump, after after the Butler attempted assassination. And suddenly you have Sunder [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=693.36s)]
*  Pinchai over at the inauguration, the sort of opening up of the tech universe to the Trump [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=697.6s)]
*  universe has has had some pretty impressive effects inside the Republican Party. But it also, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=703.6800000000001s)]
*  as I say, opened up a bunch of fissures over everything from sort of free trade and tariffs, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=709.0400000000001s)]
*  where tech bros are not in favor of tariffs. They're much more in favor of free trade. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  President Trump obviously is much more in favor of tariffs. And that tension has been playing [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=716.32s)]
*  itself out inside the administration to issues regarding crypto, technological development, AI, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=719.9200000000001s)]
*  all of that sort of stuff is a sort of complicated mix for sure. And Elon brought something to the [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=726.4s)]
*  table beyond his money, I think. And that was, again, this image of this this guy who was for a [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=731.68s)]
*  long time the coolest person in America in the SpaceX guy, Tesla guy, innovator, bringing that [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=737.1999999999999s)]
*  to the table of a Republican Party that might have been perceived three or four years ago as a [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=742.9599999999999s)]
*  slightly older, more rural party. And so I do think that he brought that to the table. And if that [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=747.76s)]
*  starts to fray, you could see a change in the coalition. Let's put it that way for President [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=752.24s)]
*  Trump. I don't think it makes much of a difference for the future of the Republican Party. I think [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=755.92s)]
*  this was always going to happen because when you have a coalition that is formed against the [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=759.04s)]
*  dominant party, which is what happened in twenty twenty four, the Democrats were dominant. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=764.16s)]
*  Republicans were not dominant. Republicans and sort of allied parties put together a workable [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=767.6800000000001s)]
*  coalition against the Democrats. But then you get into power and you have to govern. And this happens [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=773.2s)]
*  with every single administration is that you see battles that start to emerge between the various [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=777.2s)]
*  factions of the administration. And President Trump is unifying in a way no other Republican [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=782.0s)]
*  figure of my lifetime has been. He can sort of float above a lot of those [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=786.56s)]
*  aspects. And because he's non ideological, he can pragmatically pick and choose kind of from the [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=790.32s)]
*  tree of policy in a unique way. But, you know, after President Trump is president, I think you [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=794.56s)]
*  will see a lot of these battles start to resurface. I think they're resurfacing now, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=801.52s)]
*  even while President Trump is president. And that is fascinating. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=804.88s)]
*  So I just want to pick up on what you said about Elon making the Republican Party a bit cooler. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=808.24s)]
*  It had been more rural and maybe not as like hip. I don't agree with that. I love Elon and I really [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=814.9599999999999s)]
*  do believe more than any other American. He's saved free speech in this country. I think on [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=822.48s)]
*  the trans issue, we'd be light years behind where we are right now if it hadn't been for him buying [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=826.48s)]
*  X and being really bold about that whole thing. But I mean, having obviously covered Trump for [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=830.88s)]
*  a long time very closely day to day. I think Donald Trump is the one who made the Republican [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=836.48s)]
*  Party cool again. Trump is the one who, you know, just with his fuck you attitude and his taking on [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=841.04s)]
*  wokeness, he brought Elon over. You know, Elon, he wasn't responsible for building Trump's [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=847.36s)]
*  constituency. It was totally Trump. Elon came. I mean, with all the respect to Elon, he was quite [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=852.64s)]
*  late to the party. We were all celebrating Trump. And he had brought in a lot tons of young people [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=857.76s)]
*  and changed the coalition with black and brown and other Americans. And then Elon seemed to really [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=863.84s)]
*  get on board and respected what happened with Butler and all that. And so like, I just feel like [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=869.0400000000001s)]
*  he was one of the late arrivals. He was more than the Joe Rogan, Theo von Camp, who very late in the [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=874.0s)]
*  game said, I love this guy. But a lot of us were there without those guys for a very long time on [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=878.96s)]
*  President Trump's side and singing his praises. I mean, again, I agree with that. And of course, [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=885.44s)]
*  as soon as President Trump emerged from the first primary in Iowa, I think, you know, some of us [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=890.0s)]
*  were campaigning with him. Some of us were raising money for him and all of us. But I will say that [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=894.4s)]
*  the one area where I do think something happened is there was a permission structure that did not [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=899.4399999999999s)]
*  exist before Elon and some of the tech bros jumped in that said that it was OK to be a high income [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=903.76s)]
*  earner in a blue area and say out loud that you supported President Trump. Three years ago, [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=909.5999999999999s)]
*  if you lived in San Francisco and you supported President Trump, you would probably lose your job. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=914.16s)]
*  And that is no longer the case. Yes. And that is no longer the case in a lot of these blue areas. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=917.92s)]
*  It made it acceptable. Something changed. And it wasn't one thing. I think it was many things. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=922.56s)]
*  I think one of the things was Joe Biden's absolutely abysmal performance as president, [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=926.4799999999999s)]
*  the fact that he was dead. I think part of it is that President Trump ran an actually [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=930.16s)]
*  shockingly disciplined campaign. People forget about how disciplined the campaign actually was [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=934.3199999999999s)]
*  for the vast majority of the campaign. And obviously, the assassination attempt changed [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=938.4799999999999s)]
*  a lot of things about the campaign. There were so many topsy turvy events. But one of the things [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=943.28s)]
*  that I do think Elon should be given credit for is again, the creation of a permission structure [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=946.9599999999999s)]
*  in people who would be considered the tech community or the white collar community to say, [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=952.4799999999999s)]
*  yeah, you know what? I like Trump and I'm going to put on a MAGA hat, for example, [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=958.88s)]
*  which is something that a lot of those people wouldn't have done. They might have behind closed [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=961.5999999999999s)]
*  doors been like, yeah, you know, I like Trump and I'm voting for him. I mean, I know a lot of those [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=964.56s)]
*  people. I know, Megan, you know, a lot of those people, too. But it was really only in the late [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=967.12s)]
*  stages of this election cycle where you started to hear people who are quietly saying that they [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=970.8s)]
*  might support him. I'm going to back up. I'm still not agreeing. I'm still not agreeing. [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=975.36s)]
*  I don't dismiss Elon's role in Trump's victory. I do think he played a role and it's been great [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  to have him on the top on the side of team sanity and paving the way for team sanity. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=986.72s)]
*  I've told the story before, but I had a discussion with a very, very like the top [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=991.52s)]
*  guy in tech who was like, oh, you know, we're starting to come around now on our censorship [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=995.92s)]
*  policies when it comes to the gender debate and the race discussions and the co I was like, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1000.88s)]
*  oh, you're starting to come around on it now. Like, oh, now you're going to stop the censorship. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1006.0s)]
*  And he was like, well, you know, attitudes have changed on it. So like, I'm like, [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1009.92s)]
*  how do you think that happened? How do you think the attitudes changed because [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1014.0s)]
*  Elon Musk had balls and most of the rest of you did not. He had balls to let those discussions [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1018.3199999999999s)]
*  play out. And when they were allowed to play out without forcing our side to have an arm tied [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1025.1200000000001s)]
*  behind its back, we won. So I have, that's the role that I see Elon playing. That's been so [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1031.0400000000002s)]
*  critical in all, in all of this, but Trump, those guys out in Silicon Valley, they bent the knee [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1036.8000000000002s)]
*  after Butler. Everybody saw a superhero emerge on the stage that day and said, holy shit, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1042.8000000000002s)]
*  I need to touch his cape. That's what happened with Mark Zuckerberg. He didn't do it because of [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1050.8s)]
*  Elon. He didn't even like Elon. David Sacks was coming on this program regularly for the two [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1055.52s)]
*  years leading up to the election and was very in on DeSantis, but eventually DeSantis lost. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1060.08s)]
*  And he went with Trump, I think over Ukraine, where he's much more on sort of the JD Vance field on [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1066.08s)]
*  Ukraine. But it wasn't Elon that got David over. If anything, it was maybe David who influenced [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1071.68s)]
*  Elon. That's been my take in watching it unfold. So I just think Elon may have overestimated [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1076.8s)]
*  his own role in the Trump rise and victory. And Trump of all people was not going to seed [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1082.48s)]
*  one inch on the big victory and who was responsible for it. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1089.76s)]
*  David Sacks I mean, I don't disagree with actually a lot of that. And I think the timeline [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1093.44s)]
*  lines up with what you're talking about. The Butler assassination attempt changed an enormous [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1096.96s)]
*  amount and it opened up a door for people like Elon to do that thing. The place where I'm [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1100.56s)]
*  actually most grateful to Elon aside from obviously opening up X is that I do think that [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1104.88s)]
*  what he actually tried to do with Doge was quite heroic to actually give up your life running some [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1108.64s)]
*  of the biggest companies on planet Earth and to take billions of dollars in hit in terms of market [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1114.24s)]
*  cap in order to come in and try to cut the government. Again, I think there was some [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1118.96s)]
*  something naive and ideological about it that I find actually kind of charming because government [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1123.0400000000002s)]
*  just doesn't change that quickly. You can't shift whatever the United States government is, a giant [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1127.5200000000002s)]
*  cruiser on a dime the way that Elon was attempting to do. And I think that a lot of the [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1132.64s)]
*  frustrations that he's expressing are frustrations that some of us have been having with the size and [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1136.88s)]
*  scope of the federal government for legitimately decades. But again, I think that when I've been [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1140.5600000000002s)]
*  breaking it down, I've been trying to break it down politically, business wise, and then in terms [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1145.68s)]
*  of personality. Obviously, politically, I think you have here a battle between somebody who is [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1149.68s)]
*  extremely ideological and almost naive in his ideological commitment to cutting government [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1155.6000000000001s)]
*  versus the pragmatism of President Trump. And obviously, ideologically, I agree with [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1160.8s)]
*  Elon. But when it comes to what actually can get passed and what can be done, [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1164.8799999999999s)]
*  President Trump is just correct about that with the big beautiful bill. Well, when it comes to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1167.9199999999998s)]
*  Trump has never been he has never been the opposite of a spender. He's a spender. He was [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1171.52s)]
*  a spender first term. And he's still literally he literally I mean, this is the thing that [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1176.72s)]
*  is driving me crazy about some of the people who are real fiscal hawks. I'm a fiscal hawk. But [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1180.24s)]
*  President Trump won in 2016 in part because in the primaries, he literally said he would not [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1184.1599999999999s)]
*  touch the entitlement programs. So people who are now frustrated, he won't touch the entitlement [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1188.4s)]
*  programs. He rejected the Tea Party message in 2016. And in 2020, and in 2024. You get a car, [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1191.8400000000001s)]
*  and you get a car, and you get a car philosophy of government. That's just true. That's why a lot of [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1197.3600000000001s)]
*  folks in like the more traditional lane of conservatism didn't want Trump as the nominee. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1202.4s)]
*  They got him anyway, and they decided it was worth it over Kamala Harris, obviously. But yeah, [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1207.2s)]
*  he's not going to be the person to keep the purse super tight like Elon and some others would like. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1211.3600000000001s)]
*  Right, exactly. So the so that battle is playing itself out. And that's that's a normal battle. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1216.64s)]
*  That's the same as the battle between Rand Paul, for example, and the president over the big, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1219.68s)]
*  beautiful bill, where it comes to the personality stuff. You know, this is the sort of stuff where [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1223.44s)]
*  you have two gigantic personalities. I mean, you know, both of them, I know both of them. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1227.44s)]
*  Neither of these guys is a small ego. Neither of them takes insults particularly easily. [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1231.6000000000001s)]
*  They don't really like it very much that the president is a pretty forgiving guy. I mean, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1236.8000000000002s)]
*  there are a lot of people around him who have really gone after him totally over the course [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1240.8000000000002s)]
*  of his career, and he's surrounded by them. I mean, J.D. Vance called him Hitler in 2016. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1244.16s)]
*  Now he's the vice president. Marco Rubio ran against him in 2016. Now he's the secretary of state. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1247.76s)]
*  You and the president have had some run ins. I've had like and the president is OK with all of that. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1252.24s)]
*  So but with that said, in the moment, there is never going to be an insult that passes [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1256.72s)]
*  that he does not slap back at. That's just not how he operates. And Elon is very much [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1260.88s)]
*  the same way. And so the two of them going at each other this way again, I think it would have been [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1264.64s)]
*  shocking if that had not happened at any point here. The thing that set it off is really the [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1269.76s)]
*  question. What actually set this thing off? And I don't think it was the beautiful bill. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1274.16s)]
*  I think the thing that actually set this off. The NASA guy. I think it's the NASA guy. I think [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1277.68s)]
*  the firing of Jared Isaacman at NASA was the thing that really set that off. And that is a tactical [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1282.64s)]
*  mistake by the Office of Personnel Management. It really is. I mean, like the idea that I said, [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1287.36s)]
*  just set it up for the audience because we haven't talked about it yet. Sure. So Jared Isaacman is a [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1292.56s)]
*  billionaire space entrepreneur who was nominated for the NASA administrator while Elon was in the [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1297.2s)]
*  administration. And he's a very close friend of Elon. And Elon, obviously, if I'm going to decide [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1304.0s)]
*  who I want picking the NASA administrator, Elon actually is the person I'm going to ask. He's [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1308.64s)]
*  legitimately. Yeah, he's got some expertise there. Yes. And he's the person who knows what he's [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1312.48s)]
*  doing. And Isaacman, last week, right after Elon left the administration and had started fighting [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1315.76s)]
*  with the president over the big, beautiful bill, right after that, Isaacman, his nomination was [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1322.0s)]
*  withdrawn by President Trump, presumably at the behest of the Office of Personnel Management, [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1326.16s)]
*  which I believe is run by Sergio Gore. And the sort of idea that was put forth was that Isaacman had [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1330.64s)]
*  to be withdrawn because he had Democratic donations. Now, first of all, that would have been first [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1336.0800000000002s)]
*  super easy for them to figure out when he was first nominated, right? He was nominated weeks [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1340.24s)]
*  in advance. It wasn't as though this happened within 24 hours. They knew that all along. What [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1343.68s)]
*  that really is was a way of needling Elon and kind of slapping Elon like he's out the door and he's [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1347.92s)]
*  mouthing off. And so we're going to take your friend and we're going to throw him out of a [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1353.76s)]
*  third story window. And I think Elon reacted very strongly to that. And that I get, I don't agree [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1356.32s)]
*  with the way that Elon went about his sort of revenge tour against the president. And I disagree [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1362.96s)]
*  again with like the Epstein thing, as you say, is pretty ridiculous. I mean, first of all, the idea [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1367.36s)]
*  that Democrats who had access to all the Epstein files would have sat on information that Donald [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1371.84s)]
*  Trump was pedophilically assaulting children on Epstein Island. Can you imagine? Like Joe Biden [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1376.0s)]
*  is sitting there. He's got that info and they don't release it. No way in hell. Somehow President [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1380.88s)]
*  Trump's IRS records are out there. I mean, it's just it's an absurdity. But with that said, [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1384.72s)]
*  you know, the sort of pettiness of that of getting rid of Isaac Mann, who appeared to be at least a [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1388.96s)]
*  competent NASA administrator, just to kind of just kind of slap it at Elon, this kind of stuff, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1394.5600000000002s)]
*  it should be, you know, beneath the administration. And then Elon's response should be beneath Elon. [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1400.64s)]
*  But I guess that we no longer do beneath, right? Yeah, we don't. That's exactly right. Well, [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1405.7600000000002s)]
*  that's where it got. I mean, let's let's be honest. Who was leaving X yesterday afternoon [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1410.24s)]
*  for those three hours? I mean, some of the tweets that people were sending out were [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1415.1200000000001s)]
*  hilarious. It was it was entertaining. And I have to admit, I didn't feel sad. Like a lot of [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1418.32s)]
*  Republicans are like, I'm sad. I'm like, I don't feel sad. This is ridiculous. They're having a [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1423.1200000000001s)]
*  fight. Like they're big egos and big idds behind them. And they'll probably make up. And this is [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1426.4s)]
*  just kind of drama. And sometimes we like drama. I don't know. I do get a little nervous when I'm [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1432.64s)]
*  like. When I'm seeing the left so happy, like the late night comedians last night, I'll give you a [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1436.96s)]
*  taste of how they sounded. If they're happy, I'm not happy. Like I'm not happy about the fight, [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1442.72s)]
*  but I'm just saying I'm not like sad. And all these people are like for Lorne over. It's like, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1448.32s)]
*  all right, grow up. They're having a dispute. It was bound to happen. They'll get past it. [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1452.4s)]
*  As you point out, Trump is extremely forgiving. And I'm sure Elon is too. I mean, Trump's not, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1456.4s)]
*  whatever. Laura Ingram reported last night, she's been told it's irreparable. Nothing is irreparable [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1461.92s)]
*  with Donald Trump. Nothing is irreparable. But here's how the late night losers were making fun [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1466.48s)]
*  of it. Elon gave us a fun one. Time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1472.64s)]
*  files. That's the real reason they have not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT. Oh, oh damn. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1479.3600000000001s)]
*  Oh, oh, oh. Is this Twitter war a cheesy Gordita Crunchwrap supreme? [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1489.04s)]
*  Because it's dripping hot, messy filth and I'm eating up every sloppy bite. [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1498.16s)]
*  Time to drop the really big bomb. Donald Trump is in the Epstein files. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1508.24s)]
*  That is the real reason they've not been made public. Have a nice day, DJT. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1515.76s)]
*  I knew this day would come and yet somehow it's even better than I imagined. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1526.56s)]
*  It's like coming down the stairs on Christmas morning and finding a second tree. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1531.2s)]
*  What does Elon know? What evidence could there possibly be that Trump was in league with Jeffrey [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1536.24s)]
*  Epstein other than this and this? Forget this video that Elon went ahead and posted today. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1541.76s)]
*  Okay, so they're going to shoot that into their veins and that is one reason why we should be [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1551.6s)]
*  glad. They seem to reach détente. I mean, I guess the phone calls off, Ben, but Elon's tone on X [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1556.48s)]
*  last night was much more conciliatory in response to that one guy like, okay, I won't cancel Dragon. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1563.76s)]
*  And then Bill Ackman yet again tried to be the mediator of it and Elon responded favorably to [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1569.84s)]
*  like, all right, yeah, we should stand down. Then Trump was holding an event with a fraternal order [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1574.16s)]
*  of police and was given the chance to comment on it and further bash Elon basically with the press [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1579.84s)]
*  who were asking him questions and he declined to do it. So it does seem like we've down shifted, [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1585.44s)]
*  which is also good. Yeah, that's right. And the big beautiful bill is going to pass and then [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1591.92s)]
*  all of this is going to be kind of in the rear-view mirror because that was Elon's main [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1597.04s)]
*  critique. Again, I think that Elon is going to step away from a lot of the sort of overtly [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1600.1599999999999s)]
*  political stuff. He's already said that he needs to and I think that that's probably right. So this [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1604.72s)]
*  is part of that broader shift away. Of course, the left is happy about this. What's amazing about [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1609.36s)]
*  this is that the left truly has been absolutely prone during the Trump administration. I mean, [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1614.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm amazed at this. Their absolute inability to consolidate around any single point of resistance [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1618.8799999999999s)]
*  means that, of course, they're going to enjoy this in the same way that you would enjoy it or [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1624.24s)]
*  I would enjoy it if President Biden and Alex Soros had suddenly started publicly feuding with [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1628.08s)]
*  one another. It would be wildly enjoyable and it would be really fun. And of course, you'd be [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1633.92s)]
*  following it with bated breath. And I'll admit that watching Elon kind of just randomly tweet crap [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1637.84s)]
*  about Trump and watching Trump slap back at him on his own social media service, it's good writing [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1643.92s)]
*  by God. I mean, I will admit that the writing this season by God I thought was a little weak and then [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1648.24s)]
*  God always sticks the landing like right at the very end. The season finale brings all the threads [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1652.8s)]
*  together. And I will admit that people who are treating this as like, oh my God, it's a tragedy [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1656.96s)]
*  and the rending of clothing and the weeping and the gnashing. Come on, guys. Really? I think these [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1662.0s)]
*  are kids of divorce. It's triggering for them because to most normal people, I think it's just [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1666.72s)]
*  been highly entertaining. Unfortunate, yes, it's not something you'd want if you could choose not [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1673.04s)]
*  to have it, at least as if you're a Trump supporter. But here are some of the fun reactions [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1678.0s)]
*  yesterday. Kanye, his tweet got a lot of attention. Bros, please no with a hug emoji. We love you both [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1682.96s)]
*  so much. Babylon B always for the W. Judge determines Trump will get the nation on weekdays. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1690.16s)]
*  Musk gets every other weekend and holidays. Ex user McGill's. A federal judge just issued an [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1696.96s)]
*  injunction against the Elon Trump breakup. That's right on. And then there's someone named David [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1704.64s)]
*  Burge. He writes, get your entry in now for the new Trump Elon nickname pool. I've got a fiver on [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1711.8400000000001s)]
*  muskrat. That made me laugh out loud. The redheaded libertarian. X is giving me anxiety today. I [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1718.48s)]
*  should probably go unwind with a serial killer documentary. And then this one from Ginny Hogan. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1724.72s)]
*  Today is a huge win for every woman concerned. She acted like a psycho during her last breakup. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1731.6s)]
*  And that leads me to this, this one, Ben, which we, I mean, like everybody was thinking about this [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1739.4399999999998s)]
*  movie as we watched it happened. I'll give you the clip from Mean Girls. So we cut out girls [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1744.6399999999999s)]
*  pictures from the yearbook and then we wrote comments. Trang Pak is a grusky little biatch. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1749.76s)]
*  Still true. Don Schweitzer is a fat virgin. Still half true. Amber de Lusio. She made out with a hot [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1755.6s)]
*  dog. Janice Ian Dyke. I don't know if they've seen it. I can't report that firsthand, but there seems [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1763.6s)]
*  to have been some inspo for it. Yeah. No, there were a bunch of people making comments that this [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1774.08s)]
*  is like the worst thing that could happen during gay pride month is just, just watching the breakup [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1778.32s)]
*  is just terrible. And, you know, like the whole thing is like honestly on a comedic level, [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1782.56s)]
*  if you can't laugh at this, I'm not sure what you can laugh at. I mean, it's inherently hilarious. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1788.72s)]
*  You're too close to politics. Yeah, exactly. And also you take politics too seriously. Okay. [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1793.04s)]
*  First rule of politics watching Gang and I've been doing it for a quarter century at this point. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1798.0s)]
*  First rule. It is never House of Cards. It is always Veep. Always. And this idea that it's like [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1802.08s)]
*  geniuses in the back room and they are coming up with magical plans and it's all 40 chess and [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1807.52s)]
*  underwater upside down hungry, hungry hippos. It just isn't. It just isn't. It's a bunch of [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1811.92s)]
*  big personalities who are fighting over increasingly important things. I mean, like, okay. And you know [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1815.8400000000001s)]
*  what's going to happen at the end of this? Nothing. SpaceX will continue to operate with the United [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1822.5600000000002s)]
*  States government. The big beautiful bill will still pass. Again, like the only fallout that I see is [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1826.5600000000002s)]
*  that, and you can kind of see it in influencer world, the people who really are lamenting, [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  it's like, oh my God, I'm on X and now I love Elon, but I also I'm loyal to Trump and who do I back [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1834.48s)]
*  and how do I manipulate the situation and Elon unfollowing particular people and all this kind [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1839.84s)]
*  of like, here's the deal. If you feel the necessity to sit around wondering what Elon thinks of you [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1844.56s)]
*  or what Trump thinks of you about taking sides, you think too much of yourself. These people are [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1850.56s)]
*  very- Yeah, that's exactly right. They don't care. Like really, no one gives a rat's ass. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1854.6399999999999s)]
*  Seriously. Like get over yourself. These are two big egos with the richest man in the world, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1858.8s)]
*  the most powerful man in the world having a cat fight. And you know what? You have nothing to do [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1863.9199999999998s)]
*  with it. And in the end, if it doesn't matter to the voter, then I don't really care. And I'm [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1868.16s)]
*  just going to enjoy the fireworks a little bit. There's a very Trump supporting X account, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1872.0800000000002s)]
*  but he also loves Elon that goes by the name of cat turd. And somebody tweeted out who gets cat [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1877.0400000000002s)]
*  turd in the divorce. You know, like we have so much that we're going to have to settle here. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1883.0400000000002s)]
*  But the other rule of politics too, you're right, the more than house of cards is there are no real [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1887.2s)]
*  friends in politics. There are no real friends in politics. And anybody who took the old, [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1892.0800000000002s)]
*  we're BFFs and I love Donald Trump as much as a non-gay man can love. It's like, okay, [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1897.84s)]
*  you know, they love each other as much as two people who are in politics. And Elon has been [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1905.4399999999998s)]
*  in politics for the past six months can love each other. That's until the love expires over [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1911.12s)]
*  something like the big, beautiful bill. I don't think the big, beautiful bill is ever at risk [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1917.12s)]
*  of causing Mrs. Dr. Shapiro and Ben Shapiro to break up. It's also not at risk of dividing [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1921.36s)]
*  Doug Brunton yours truly. It's not love and it's not real friendship. It's an ally ship. And it's [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1928.9599999999998s)]
*  there until it doesn't work for one or both parties. That's exactly right. I mean, it's a business [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1934.6399999999999s)]
*  like any other business. And I think Elon knows that. I think, I think Trump knows that. I don't [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1939.9199999999998s)]
*  think either of them is personally affected in any deep and abiding way by any of this. I think the [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1943.52s)]
*  one lesson that should come out of this actually, when it comes to sort of the arguments over the [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1948.64s)]
*  electric vehicle mandate and SpaceX subsidies and all this kind of stuff is actually ideologically, [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1952.5600000000002s)]
*  Elon is right. You know, it'd be awesome if the government were so small that you couldn't use it [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1958.0800000000002s)]
*  as giant grab bag of cash for particular policies. But as we say, I think the overwrought drama and [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1961.2800000000002s)]
*  people, it is fun to watch. I mean, I will admit that watching the exchanges between like Cat Turd [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1969.0400000000002s)]
*  and Alex Jones over who they side with and like Alex Jones literally said to Cat Turd today on on [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1973.44s)]
*  X, I'm not part of your cult. And I'm like, I don't even know what's going on anymore. But you know [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1979.52s)]
*  what? I'm just like sitting back, popcorn meme like, okay, you know what, I'm here for the ride. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1983.52s)]
*  Okay, whatever. We were joking that our, you know, we have this now a morning news update, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1988.48s)]
*  update, podcasts we put out, we were joking that our producers on it last night were like, oh my [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1994.48s)]
*  God, am I like trying to keep up with every iteration as soon as you thought you had it like [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=1998.16s)]
*  done? It wasn't done. There was another iteration coming your way. More of the leftist reaction to [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2002.48s)]
*  this. These are actually kind of laughable and fun. Let's check in on AOC and see what she has to say. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2008.4s)]
*  Any quick reaction on what's going on with Elon Musk and President Trump on Twitter right now? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2014.8s)]
*  Oh man, the girls are fighting, aren't they? I think this breakup we've been seeing a long time [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2018.88s)]
*  coming, but we'll see what the impacts are of it legislatively. [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2024.4s)]
*  Okay, you're so cool referring to them as the girls. She's above it all, Ben. That's what she's [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2032.48s)]
*  trying to telegraph. You see, she's the adult in the room, the one out there who does a preacher [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2037.84s)]
*  accent and she leans into her fake Latina accent. And like she's the adult in the room. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2043.2s)]
*  Yeah, again, like Democrats had a good day yesterday, but it isn't that great a day because [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2050.72s)]
*  their poll numbers still suck. And Donald Trump's poll numbers are stronger than they've been [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2055.2s)]
*  actually for weeks at this point. And so if the best they can do is just enjoy the fireworks the [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2059.12s)]
*  same way you and I are enjoying the fireworks, that doesn't win them any additional votes. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2063.7599999999998s)]
*  It's not as though anyone is going to vote against Republicans because Donald Trump and Elon Musk are [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2066.96s)]
*  having a fight or vote in favor of AOC because there's some drama happening in the White House. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2070.96s)]
*  That's not the way any of this works. That's right. Or vote down to BBB. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2075.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. She has no power. She has no influence. Like 20% of the Democratic Party [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2079.7599999999998s)]
*  thinks she's the thought leader. I think Republicans at this point are probably rooting for her to be [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2084.88s)]
*  the thought leader of the Democratic Party because it means they have no thoughts. But this sort of [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2088.16s)]
*  you know, like, oh my God, the girls are fighting kind of thing. Who thinks that's charming or [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2093.6s)]
*  interesting or fun? No, she's the mature one. Again, the amazing thing, I will never get over [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2098.0s)]
*  the fact that the Democratic Party has been given some actual opportunities if they wanted to attack [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2104.24s)]
*  the Trump administration to do so, but they can't let go of their insane radicalism long enough to [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2108.72s)]
*  do it. It really is like an amazing, incredible thing. They're still out there doing the trans [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2113.92s)]
*  athletes in sports and illegal immigrants need health care routine. And meanwhile, Donald Trump [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2118.32s)]
*  is actually getting things done with executive orders and major legislation on the foreign policy [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2123.36s)]
*  front. You could imagine a world where the Democratic Party was not insane and they actually [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2128.16s)]
*  were able to somehow twist this into a broader narrative, but they just have no capacity to do it. [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2132.2400000000002s)]
*  Oh, Chris Murphy's out there. Okay, he says the following. When 15 million Americans lose their [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2137.44s)]
*  health care and plunge into personal crisis, none of them are going to give a shit. This is his new [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2143.68s)]
*  things to drop swears. He thinks it makes him relatable about a made for clicks Twitter fight [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2147.7599999999998s)]
*  between two billionaires, blah, blah, blah. Okay, get get boys out of girl sports. You disgusting [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2152.7999999999997s)]
*  pervert. I'm sorry, but anybody who enjoys watching that there's something wrong with them. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2158.48s)]
*  There's something wrong with Chris Murphy. No, like take a seat until you know how to protect [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2161.9199999999996s)]
*  12 year old girls. You can be quiet. No one wants to hear your opinion about anything. [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2166.8799999999997s)]
*  And then I'll give you this one from my old pal over the New York Times Lulu Garcia Navarro. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2171.44s)]
*  She's she's not really my pal, but she interviewed me and I actually liked her. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2176.56s)]
*  But she's a leftist and saying leftist things about the Trump Elon fight. Here's what she said on CNN. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2180.0s)]
*  I have so many thoughts about this. So, you know, I think this is bad for Musk. I am. If you look at [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2187.36s)]
*  the history around the world of authoritarians breaking up with their oligarch buddies, those [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2198.56s)]
*  oligarch buddies don't end up in a good place. They either end up impoverished, imprisoned or dead. [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2203.44s)]
*  I'm not saying that that's going to happen to Elon Musk here, but the power is with the government. [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2209.2799999999997s)]
*  You saw Donald Trump immediately say, All right, we're going to take away your, you know, contracts. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2215.92s)]
*  Impoverished, imprisoned or dead. I'm not saying that's what is going to happen, but that's typically [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2221.84s)]
*  what would happen in this kind of a fight. Everybody needs to calm the F down. Seriously, [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2230.56s)]
*  just calm the F down. And it's not just her, by the way. Like I know Steve Bannon is just enjoying [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2235.92s)]
*  himself wildly. And Steve's like Steve is having like Steve's orgasmic over this because Steve for [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2240.56s)]
*  Can I play some can just hold that thought for forgive me because we have a little bit of that. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2246.48s)]
*  And here's let's play the audience. What we're talking about. Sock for from Bannon last night, [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2250.4s)]
*  President Trump should be taking immediately. I think when he threatens to take one of the big [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2254.64s)]
*  programs out of SpaceX, President Trump tonight should sign an executive order calling for the [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2258.4s)]
*  Defense to Production Act to be called in SpaceX and seize SpaceX tonight before midnight. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2266.48s)]
*  And he said that Trump should deport Elon, who Steve is convinced lied about the facts [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2273.92s)]
*  in order to get his citizen application approved. Steve is so thirsty to be in the White House. He's [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2279.68s)]
*  so thirsty. And listen, again, Steve and I don't get along. I agree with some of the things Steve [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2286.7999999999997s)]
*  says and he's brilliant. And Elon, he don't get along. Oh, well, he hates Elon. I mean, like really hates Elon. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2292.64s)]
*  Yeah, hates him. And so from the day that Elon had influence with Trump, he's been waiting for this [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2298.08s)]
*  moment to kind of insert himself back into the narrative. But I love that the way that Steve does [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2302.3999999999996s)]
*  that is always by taking the most outrageous possible position. We should put him in jail and [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2306.88s)]
*  then we should slay him by execution the next morning. By firing. Seize his company. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2310.48s)]
*  We should nationalize all of SpaceX and Tesla just for good measure. Just to f with them. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2316.32s)]
*  We should take X and we should reverse merge it into truth social. Like, come on, really, Steve, [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2320.4s)]
*  really? Like, OK, I get it. I get it. Stop being so thirsty. President Trump will eventually return [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2327.44s)]
*  your phone calls. Like, really? It was fun. All right. So over on Team Sanity, that's that's AOC. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2332.0s)]
*  That's what she would tell you. The Dems are or Chris Murphy that they're they're now Team Sanity. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2340.72s)]
*  They're having debates about the immigration problem that include terms like undocumented citizens. [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2345.04s)]
*  It is let that sink in undocumented citizens, a term that was actually dropped on CNN last night. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2353.92s)]
*  Listen to it here. Scott Jennings is involved. Bakari Sellers is involved. And then Kat Abu-Gazela, [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2360.3999999999996s)]
*  a Democrat Illinois congressional candidate on free health care for illegals. Watch. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2367.04s)]
*  Everyone deserves health care. Even illegals? Every single person in the world deserves. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2372.4799999999996s)]
*  Just for the record, as a candidate, you're for illegal aliens getting Medicaid. I think everyone [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2377.04s)]
*  in the world deserves health care. That's a yes. That's a yes. Can I start my logic training? [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2380.8799999999997s)]
*  Are you for it or not? My logic training starts with the fact that I don't want to I don't want [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2384.4799999999996s)]
*  to kick 11 million people off. Do you want illegal aliens on or not? Do I want to first of all, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2388.96s)]
*  do I want undocumented citizens to have health care? The answer is yes. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2394.48s)]
*  Oh, God, that is that is not a thing, Ben. No, it is not. In fact, you need to have your documents [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2399.84s)]
*  to be a citizen. And that is that is oxymoronic. I mean, it's it is amazing. This is on the moronic. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2408.24s)]
*  They literally cannot just let go of their far left priors and it's going to sink them. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2416.48s)]
*  It truly is. Again, if you are strategizing this out, if you're a Democrat, what you'd be [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2421.6s)]
*  strategizing out right now is something where you say, look, the economy could be soaring right now. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2426.24s)]
*  Instead, the economy is sort of wavering right now. And that's because of the tariff war or that's [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2430.0s)]
*  because of the cozy relationship between business and Trump and all of their people who are getting [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2435.2s)]
*  rich while the American workers being left behind. You could you could try to trot something out like [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2440.3199999999997s)]
*  that, but they can't do it. Instead, they're arguing over their undocumented citizens, which [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2444.64s)]
*  again makes literally zero sense, literally none. It's like saying felonious innocence. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2448.96s)]
*  I mean, that's not how it works. They do it. Trotting that out. And that's your pitch. This is [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2454.7999999999997s)]
*  your big pitch for getting back in the game. This is this is it. This is your thing. When you see [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2460.4s)]
*  the numbers like the polls that show the American public is so overwhelming in favor of, yes, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2464.56s)]
*  deporting all not not just the criminal illegals, they're all criminal illegals, but the extra [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2468.7999999999997s)]
*  criminals like who have committed murders and rapes and child molestation, but all of them, [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2473.52s)]
*  all of them. So here's a little bit more from that same debate is it descended into [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2478.0s)]
*  being about slavery. OK, watch. Scott, do you think that your family was born here? [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2482.08s)]
*  You weren't born here, Scott. I was born in. First of all, where did your family come from? [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2487.36s)]
*  My family wasn't born here. Our country is built on immigration, period. What kind? Period. What [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2491.52s)]
*  kind? Oh, first of all, before we go to commercial, what kind? What kind of [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2498.08s)]
*  immigration was I brought here? You're already in the hole. You sure you want to stop thinking? [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2502.48s)]
*  Because it was slavery. That's not immigration. Come on. Well, come on. What? There's a lot to be [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2505.36s)]
*  said. Hold on. Hold on. But you just can't say come on when somebody's like my family was brought here [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2510.4s)]
*  in chains. The answer is not come on. We're going to. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2516.16s)]
*  What? I says this is what the left always does when you have them against the wall. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2520.64s)]
*  They play the race card. That's their favorite thing to do. Or it could be the identity card, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2525.36s)]
*  it being Pride Month. That's a favorite for the month of June. But he he was trying to make the [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2529.6800000000003s)]
*  point we were not built on illegal immigration. The country was in a very different position [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2534.6400000000003s)]
*  because that's what the left always wants to say. We're built on immigration, built on immigration. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2538.8s)]
*  We weren't importing against the law, against U.S. policy, a bunch of criminals from Venezuela. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2543.2000000000003s)]
*  That's not how the United States was built. Right. And again, it seems kind of insulting [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2550.0800000000004s)]
*  the descendants of slaves to compare people who were literally brought here in chains against [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2555.44s)]
*  their will to people who are voluntarily illegally crossing the border and then receiving government [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2558.96s)]
*  benefits. That doesn't seem like the same thing to me at all, actually. It's a bizarre argument [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2563.68s)]
*  for certain. But again, just demonstrates that the Democrats, they cannot get out of their own way. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2570.24s)]
*  They cannot get out of their own way. They're so ideologically tied to this intersectional view [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2573.68s)]
*  of what politics has to be that and hoping that there's some deus ex machina that basically saves [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2577.68s)]
*  I think that's really what's happening partially with this, Elon Trump fight and them hoping this [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2582.64s)]
*  is the deus ex machina. This is going to be the event from the outside, the exogenous shock [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2586.96s)]
*  that somehow is going to wake Americans up to the fact that Trump is crazy and Elon is crazy and the [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2591.36s)]
*  entire Republican Party is so crazy. And then they'll like move back into our category. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2595.52s)]
*  Guys, whatever is going on between Elon and Trump in half as crazy as the proposition that boys are [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2599.36s)]
*  girls and America ought not have a southern border. Right on. By the way, Trump tweeted out the other [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2603.6s)]
*  day that Joe Biden died in 2020 and that this version of him is like fake. So if that like [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2608.16s)]
*  that didn't really convince anybody that that was a day ending and why in the current political era. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2614.72s)]
*  So no one's going to believe Trump's crazy. He says crazy things to get a rise out of people [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2622.3999999999996s)]
*  to entertain us. But that they haven't been able to sell that thus far. Here is the other piece of [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2626.8799999999997s)]
*  the Democrat problem. They're elitist snobs and all these policies, they're desperate. And we see [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2632.3199999999997s)]
*  this with some of the Chamber of Commerce Republicans too. They're desperate to keep these [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2637.12s)]
*  illegals here because they really do want them to mow their lawns. That's how they see it. It's like [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2640.48s)]
*  they always say, who's going to mow your lawn? Who's going to take care of your garden? [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2647.44s)]
*  If we don't have illegals here. And now we have this nutcase, videos from Vermont Daily Chronicle, [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2651.44s)]
*  Democratic representative, Becca Balint, and an appearance the other day, putting an even [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2656.96s)]
*  more interesting spin on it in Sat 9. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2662.8s)]
*  Oh my God, Ben. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2692.8s)]
*  That's a take. That's a take. Gotta have some people here legally so they can wipe some asses. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2700.6400000000003s)]
*  That's a take. I mean, I assume that Biden family has enough money that they can hire people who [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2706.4s)]
*  are legal to wipe the ex-presidents ass. But that is like, this is, I love that if a Republican ever [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2711.1200000000003s)]
*  said that about illegal immigrants, who would immediately be the most racist thing you ever [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2718.0800000000004s)]
*  heard? And Democrats just kind of prop that stuff out there as though it's totally normal. [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2720.8s)]
*  And then everybody just kind of goes about their business. It really is an amazing thing. So we've [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2725.6800000000003s)]
*  heard in the last 10 minutes that illegal immigrants are akin to slaves and also that [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2729.84s)]
*  illegal immigrants must be here to wipe the butts of Americans. And that's somehow, wait, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2734.96s)]
*  were the, like our party is the racist party? I'm really concerned about how Becca Balint, [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2743.28s)]
*  does she not know how to wipe her ass? Because I don't know how she made it to this point [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2748.56s)]
*  in adulthood without that skill. To be fair, she's in Congress. That's that, [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2752.0s)]
*  I'm not going to go there. That is quite possible. A significant percentage of Congress does not know [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2756.16s)]
*  how to wipe their own ass. But here's the big question. Who has a dumber general collection? [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2760.72s)]
*  If you average the IQ, which group would be dumber? Members of Congress or members of media? [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2766.32s)]
*  Oh God. Wow. I know. You with your IQ, that's a tough one to answer. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2772.32s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't know the, I mean, I believe that zero, that you can't go below it in terms [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2778.7200000000003s)]
*  of IQ. So now you're asking me to compare zero to this, like comparing infinity to infinity. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2784.88s)]
*  Like the number is equivalent. I'm not sure that. We're in negatives. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2789.44s)]
*  Yes. Okay. Well, listen, this might put you over the edge. I'm going to try. Hold on a second. [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2792.96s)]
*  There's so many to choose from here that I've got teed up for you. Here is Christiane Amampour, [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2797.84s)]
*  who, well, I'll just let the soundbite speak for itself. Stop 19. [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2804.08s)]
*  When I went to Harvard to give this speech and it was just a few days ago last week, [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2808.64s)]
*  I must say, I was afraid I'm a foreigner. I don't have a green card. I'm not an American citizen. [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2814.32s)]
*  I'm fairly prominent. And I literally prepared to go to America as if I was going to North Korea. [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2819.92s)]
*  I took a burner phone, Jamie. Imagine that. And I was really afraid I'd even talk to the [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2828.0s)]
*  CNN security person because of this. I've heard that many, including British citizens, [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2834.24s)]
*  have been stopped at the border and questioned for hours and hours. It was scary. Luckily, Jamie, [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2840.32s)]
*  I was welcomed. I mean, the immigration officer at Boston, where I came in, could not have been nicer. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2847.2s)]
*  Christiane Amampour, she's worried she's going to get hunted down in the street for being [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2858.48s)]
*  a British citizen. Yeah. And she's the international reporter. I mean, she should [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2862.64s)]
*  try going to many of the countries that she covers and see how she's treated there. But by the way, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2866.88s)]
*  I'm going to go full Steve Bannon here. We totally should have arrested and deported her. [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2871.84s)]
*  Why the hell not? I mean, he's not wrong about everything. He's not wrong about everything. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2875.92s)]
*  I mean, by the way, she thought she was going to be treated badly at Harvard. At Harvard? Really? [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2879.92s)]
*  Okay, I went to the law school over there. Christiane Amampour, basically, they have a [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2885.04s)]
*  statue of her at the Harvard School of International Relations at the Kennedy School of Government. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2888.08s)]
*  Like, what absolute horrifying. She was scared. I'm sure she was deeply fearful. I'm sure it was [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2892.4s)]
*  like traveling into Syria or something. I got another one for you. We deserve this fun today, [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2898.0s)]
*  Ben Shapiro. We deserve it. We work hard for a living. We do this every day. Some days are [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2902.32s)]
*  leaner than others, but today is an abundance of riches. I give you Whoopi Goldberg on Maryland [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2906.4s)]
*  Governor Wes Moore. He is a black man who many thought, well, still think could be the Democrat [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2913.36s)]
*  nominee, although officially he said he's not interested. But listen to this. [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2920.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, you have someone like Wes Moore, who is a perfect candidate. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2924.08s)]
*  And people are saying, well, he, you know, you can't elect a black man. Why not? [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2929.28s)]
*  Oh, hell yeah. Well, we did it twice. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2933.6800000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm just, but I'm saying. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2935.36s)]
*  And what I like about Wes Moore, for example, he thinks outside of the box. [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2939.44s)]
*  People are saying you can't elect a black man. Literally no sane person is saying that. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2943.36s)]
*  Well, I mean, we did twice. So, I mean, that's kind of weird. And then they tried to have us [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2950.8s)]
*  elect a black lady after their candidate died. So yeah. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2956.1600000000003s)]
*  And we did elect that black lady twice as our vice president. Well, once as our vice president [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2959.76s)]
*  and once as a US Senator. Right. That is true to our great and everlasting shame and discredit. [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=2964.0s)]

*  of the Elon Trump Mean Girls dust up? I was begging and pleading with my friends in the group [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3168.8s)]
*  chat this morning to give me like a summary of the bill. The bill sounds good. Overall, I'm sure with [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3175.76s)]
*  like bill big bills like that. There's always some filler. I think that he flew too close to the sun. [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3183.1200000000003s)]
*  He like overestimated his power. Yeah. Because I think like he is a guy who, you know, he we have [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3188.8s)]
*  to be grateful to Elon because he did buy Twitter. He was a top donor to the Trump campaign. I think [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3196.24s)]
*  he really moved wouldn't have won without him. Yeah. I really play with fire. Well, that was the [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3202.9599999999996s)]
*  crazy part because I think he really did, for example, move the needle and getting a lot of [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3207.4399999999996s)]
*  the other tech moguls like Bezos and Zuckerberg to come around to the right more. But when he's [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3210.9599999999996s)]
*  talking when he's like going on the computer and talking about that Trump should exercise a little [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3218.24s)]
*  bit more gratitude. He sounds like an ungrateful immigrant. Right. He's right. He said so so [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3224.24s)]
*  ungrateful or something. Yeah. Yeah. Which was he seems like a scorned lover. Yeah. You're you're [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3228.56s)]
*  at risk of seeming like a bitter ex. Yeah. I mean, there's part of me because I have a little bit of [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3233.68s)]
*  a paranoid streak that thinks it's all a little bit of theater and KFAB perhaps that explore. What [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3238.48s)]
*  do you mean? KFAB? What is that? Like from wrestling where they like are kind of stunting. Okay. But [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3244.56s)]
*  they all everyone knows that it's fake. Trump's always doing a little bit of that. Yeah. I mean, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3249.44s)]
*  I don't know if I feel like Elon, he's erratic. Very much so. And so I feel like he probably did [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3254.4s)]
*  feel attacked when they yanked his NASA nominee. He didn't like that. He reportedly almost came to [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3263.28s)]
*  blows with Scott Besson over who was going to head up the IRS. Elon wanted that whistleblower. [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3268.2400000000002s)]
*  He's a good man. Gary Shapley, who was one of the ones who blew the whistle on how they were [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3275.68s)]
*  slow rolling the investigation into Hunter Biden and that the Joe Biden DOJ was not letting him and [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3280.56s)]
*  his team of investigators actually figure out what Hunter did in time for a criminal case to be [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3286.88s)]
*  brought. So he's a heroic man, in my view. And Elon reportedly was behind him as the head of IRS, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3292.48s)]
*  but Scott Besson didn't want him. He wanted as Scott Besson is at Treasury, obviously, the IRS is [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3300.16s)]
*  under his purview, ultimately, and he wanted his own guy. And reportedly, they almost came to actual [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3306.16s)]
*  blows in the White House. So I think Elon is he's got an explosive temper. Yeah. And he was pissed [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3312.3199999999997s)]
*  that his NASA proposal guy who was well on his way to getting chosen and confirmed got yanked [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3321.12s)]
*  because OMB decided it wasn't the right guy and the guy was actually a Democrat. Ben Shapiro and [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3327.68s)]
*  I were talking about it a little bit. I think he learned and appreciate that. I think Elon genuinely [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3333.04s)]
*  does hate the big, beautiful bill. Yeah, he wants a slim bill. He said slim, slim and beautiful. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3336.3199999999997s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I don't think it's really like about deficit spending. Cheers. [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3343.2799999999997s)]
*  And the doubt is about deficits. We're not for him. Like people are saying it's about the NASA [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3350.72s)]
*  appointee, the EV mandates and so on and so forth. I think that he just really miscalculated [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3355.44s)]
*  his role in the administration, his place in the organization, his place in the cosmos because [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3362.16s)]
*  he's obviously a very smart guy who's a little bit autistic and retarded. And I think he's made the [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3369.44s)]
*  classic error where he thinks because he's had like, you know, some not some but a great deal of [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3376.32s)]
*  success and has a lot of expertise in certain particular fields that this kind of translates [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3382.16s)]
*  to some greater wisdom or omniscience across the board. Well, and especially when you're talking [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3389.6s)]
*  about politics, it's its own animal in the same way Trump should not spend six months at, you know, [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3395.2s)]
*  SpaceX and try to advise Elon on how to make Rockets. Like Elon is on thin ice spending six [[00:56:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3402.3199999999997s)]
*  months in politics trying to tell Trump how you get legislation through what can be done. I mean, [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3408.56s)]
*  the whole thing is always so ugly and disgusting and a turn off. That's politics. Well, Bannon's [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3413.52s)]
*  probably feeling pretty vindicated. Bannon's feeling really happy because he's been harping [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3421.12s)]
*  about the tech oligarchs. Yeah, Batya Ungar Sargon. Same. She's been she writes now for the [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3425.7599999999998s)]
*  Free Press, but she's a Democrat who's a Trump voter and very focused on the working class. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3431.44s)]
*  And she's not an Elon fan. There's this guy Dave Marcus, who used to come on this show, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3437.12s)]
*  but then he got hired for Fox by Fox. So now he can't come on. But he's he's skeptical about [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3441.04s)]
*  Elon. A lot of guys who are really like in touch with the working class, and I would include all [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3445.92s)]
*  three I just said, have been very skeptical of Elon. And thinking that this whole thing is about [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3449.68s)]
*  Elon pushing Elon's interest, not this fight, but his whole alliance. I don't believe that. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3455.04s)]
*  Yeah, he seems like autistic enough that he believes he believes about in some like greater [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3460.24s)]
*  principle or ideal. I don't think it's strictly about his. He's also calculated enough that he's [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3465.84s)]
*  not going to do something that's against his interest. Right. Except for having this huge [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3471.52s)]
*  crash out from. Well, or getting political in the first place was dangerous just because look what [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3476.6400000000003s)]
*  happened to Tesla. But the truth is, you know, Elon, I saw him last September, September of 2024, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3482.2400000000002s)]
*  at the All In Summit out in California. And his big issue was, we're going broke, we're going [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3490.64s)]
*  bankrupt, and that we have to find ways to save within this federal government, or we're going to [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3498.24s)]
*  go bankrupt. And you know, the politician attitude is kick the can down the road until we are bankrupt. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3503.68s)]
*  It's really someone else's problem. It's like sustainably unsustainable forever and ever until [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3510.3199999999997s)]
*  it's not and obviously like with this bill, as a friend of mine pointed out, [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3515.52s)]
*  trillions of dollars. Yes, 37 trillion 10 years, you said. And it's going to raise it 3 trillion [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3518.8s)]
*  more over the course of 10 years. Unless unless GDP spurs like it gets spurred by the tax cuts, [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3525.6s)]
*  and it goes up proportionally. I mean, it's obviously the the spending cuts will not be [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3531.04s)]
*  enough to offset the tax cuts, as I understand it. Is this bill getting passed? Yes, first place it [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3537.04s)]
*  is. Okay. Yep, it's going through. But Trump is banking on like what happened in 2017 is Trump [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3543.36s)]
*  lowered that corporate tax rate, like by double digits, he lowered taxes across the economic [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3548.7200000000003s)]
*  spectrum, the poor who barely pay taxes to begin with, all the way up to the uber wealthy all got [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3555.28s)]
*  a tax cut. And the economy got chugging. I mean, it was great. Before COVID hit, it was great. [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3560.6400000000003s)]
*  And he's banking on the same thing happening now he doesn't listen to it is a left leaning CBO [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3567.2000000000003s)]
*  congressional budget office that scores how much will be added to the deficit. And they don't really [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3571.84s)]
*  bake in the American worker engine of like, this is going to make people hire truly if if I get to [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3577.36s)]
*  keep the tax cuts I got in 2017 by the way net net my taxes went up because in the tri state region, [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3584.2400000000002s)]
*  we had the salt deduction taken away. It was whatever fine. But I will hire I'd be more [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3591.1200000000003s)]
*  likely to hire than than I would defy her like if they jack my taxes up, I'm not going to take the [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3595.92s)]
*  hit. I'm probably just not going to hire an additional body. That makes sense. And with the [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=3601.28s)]

*  I don't either. I don't either. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4282.56s)]
*  This guy is the worst. I'm so shocked. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4283.84s)]
*  Cuomo is a criminal. And I mean, I believe because of what he did to the nursing homes. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4285.92s)]
*  And you've got Eric Adams, who at least is starting to see the light and has at least a background as [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4290.72s)]
*  a cop. And then you've got this lunatic like this guy frees the rent. Like you say, like what [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4295.92s)]
*  portion of New Yorkers have rent subsidization? Like most people are paying through the nose. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4300.72s)]
*  I actually, I do. [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4305.280000000001s)]
*  You do? [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4306.320000000001s)]
*  I do. [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4306.64s)]
*  So why don't you look at rents? [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4307.12s)]
*  Rent stabilization is a lot of New Yorkers actually have. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4309.04s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4312.96s)]
*  Bigot, I never had that even in my lowest earning days. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4313.76s)]
*  And you might have. You might have not owned your rights. Technically, if you live in a building [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4318.08s)]
*  that's more than six units that was built before 1970 or something, they can't raise your rent [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4321.92s)]
*  more than 2% on a year lease, 5% on a two year lease. [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4327.36s)]
*  No, I should not have that. When I first moved to New York, I moved downtown. This is [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4330.72s)]
*  1997. Okay. I was a very young lawyer and I moved to New York and this is, you know, [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4337.2s)]
*  I used to go hang out in the World Trade Center and get my coffee and read the paper over there. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4343.68s)]
*  That's how long ago this was. And I was right next to Trinity Church, which is where Alexander [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4347.44s)]
*  Hamilton is buried. And it was down in the financial district, which now has had some [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4352.48s)]
*  more development, but at the time was absolutely barren. You know, just complete concrete jungle. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4356.32s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4361.04s)]
*  I'll never forget moving in there because it was so stark and not warm, just cold, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4362.32s)]
*  white concrete everywhere. And I was 26 and I had one of those moments that you have in life where [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4368.96s)]
*  my phone wasn't on, my electricity wasn't on, you know, nothing worked yet. Like everybody had been [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4377.36s)]
*  supposed to, they were supposed to have arrived that day to turn it all on and they didn't. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4383.2s)]
*  So it was dark. I had my boxes and I had concrete jungle around me. And I walked to a hotel, [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4387.6s)]
*  the Millennium Hotel down there. I'm trying to remember now. And I called my mom on a payphone. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4395.28s)]
*  Okay. Like cell phones just started on 95. And I called my mom crying. Like I felt so scared and [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4400.96s)]
*  alone and like, what have I done? I don't know if it's a good idea. And my mom was so great. She [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4408.72s)]
*  said, you need to get some family pictures up. You need to tomorrow. First thing, figure out where [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4413.2s)]
*  your grocery store is, figure out where your dry cleaner is smart. Like take a walk around the block, [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4418.639999999999s)]
*  familiarize yourself with your new neighborhood, take a deep breath and welcome to adulthood. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4424.24s)]
*  It was great. You know, it's like, so anyway, I don't know why I'm telling you this story, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4429.92s)]
*  but that was my life in downtown New York. And it definitely was not rent subsidized. And sadly, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4432.639999999999s)]
*  after the World Trade Center went down in 9 11, one of the planes engines was found on top of my [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4437.36s)]
*  old building. That's how close it was. Thank God I had left. I had left in 2000 right before. So it's [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4445.12s)]
*  like by divine right order. I wasn't down there at the time. Were you guys living in New York back [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4453.36s)]
*  then? You were young. No, you were children. We were, we were, I was in high school and Tasha was [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4457.839999999999s)]
*  probably in elementary school. Yeah, these are the moments in kindergarten. Very long in the two. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4462.4s)]
*  No, but that like the 9 11 thing too, it just crazy that, you know, New York City experienced [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4468.16s)]
*  9 11. And now we have this DSA candidate who's like panning to the camera and saying I'm a [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4474.639999999999s)]
*  progressive Muslim immigrant. His whole provenance is very sketchy. He's launched this like ostensibly [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4479.2s)]
*  grassroots campaign with his funding that he gets as a secret intelligence asset. I'm sure his [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4484.96s)]
*  parents, he only became a citizen, as you mentioned in 2018, didn't seem to care much about [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4491.6s)]
*  citizenship up until then. His parents are like these kind of global citizen types. His mother is [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4498.8s)]
*  a, you know, it's a female filmmaker Friday. She's a famous filmmaker. His father is a academic who [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4504.08s)]
*  has like cushy sinecures at Columbia and the University of Uganda. Naturally study his specialty [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4511.52s)]
*  is Africana studies and colonialism. He, I think, you know, their attitude as my friend, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4518.48s)]
*  Ina Steffman pointed out, out was that, um, citizenship is kind of a minor administrative [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4527.04s)]
*  matter, a trifle. And I, that's kind of the attitude that he held until recently, as she says, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4533.679999999999s)]
*  up until the point that he decided he wanted a position of power in the United States. [[01:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4538.959999999999s)]
*  Does he have a chance? I haven't fallen. Well, he has a chance because I've hated on him so [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4543.44s)]
*  much that the leftists are going to come out and drove. So if he wins my bad, no, he's falling. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4548.24s)]
*  AOC endorsed him. Yes. That's scary. That's reason enough to vote against him. Well, he's like AOC [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4553.84s)]
*  deja vu. I mean, it takes me back to 2018 when we got in trouble because we were critical of the AOC [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4559.28s)]
*  like campaign ad where she's switching from sneakers to heels on the subway and bragging [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4567.92s)]
*  about being like a barista or bartender or whatever. And you could tell that it's like [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4573.6s)]
*  totally fake Astro turfed. I really can't believe that anybody is falling for DSA candidates in [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4577.6s)]
*  2020. I know neither can I. It's so ridiculous. Especially after like the day after 10 seven, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4584.320000000001s)]
*  they were in the middle of Times Square chanting. It's all Israel's fault. Like, okay, this is kind [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4588.8s)]
*  of the end. I think they were outside my apartment because I live by the Egyptian embassy. They were [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4593.52s)]
*  writing piss reel on the sidewalk. October 8. Wow. Ben Shapiro back in here. Yeah. Well, what he's [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4597.92s)]
*  saying, I'm sure you would not be a fan of the DSA. I can't believe they still exist. All right, [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4604.96s)]
*  let's shift gears because there's a lot more to go over. John Hamm is resurrecting his, he's having [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4609.36s)]
*  a renaissance of sorts in his career. Like he kind of went silent after mad men for many years. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4618.0s)]
*  By the way, whatever happened to Anthony or not Anthony, Andrew Matthew wiener, Matthew wiener. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4622.88s)]
*  He was the genius behind mad men. Oh, yeah. He wrote it. He was the show runner. And then he kind [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4629.92s)]
*  of just like, I went away. He's just counting his money. That's how John Hamm became famous, [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4634.72s)]
*  mad men. And he was brilliant as Don Draper. And now he's back in this friends and neighbors. Have [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4640.32s)]
*  you seen it at all? No. All right. We just started watching it, Doug and I. And it's very [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4646.08s)]
*  interesting. He's like a down on his luck financial trader guy. I don't remember what area of finance [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4651.84s)]
*  he was in. But on the first episode, he loses his job and you find out he lost his marriage, [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4658.24s)]
*  because his wife cheated on him, Amanda Pete. And then he I mean, spoiler alert, but you learned [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4664.16s)]
*  it in the first episode, he becomes a thief. So he has the advantage of living in this very [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4671.28s)]
*  rich community and knowing all these rich people because he was one like yesterday. [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4676.08s)]
*  So they don't expect him at all. And he knows when they're all at the local benefit for the [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4680.32s)]
*  children. And he uses those nights to go into his friends homes and starts burgling them [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4685.4400000000005s)]
*  and stealing watches, etc. And then finds a fence, a fence for the for the stolen goods. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4691.92s)]
*  Well, apparently, we're a little behind Doug and I are only on episode three, I think, or four. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4697.52s)]
*  But in episode six, he and Amanda Pete, I don't know whether this is a throwback doesn't matter. [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4701.6s)]
*  But he and Amanda Pete, his, his ex wife, go into a church and steal the Eucharist and start [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4707.76s)]
*  snacking on it, which I have to say, even as somebody I am Catholic, and I am observant, [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4717.4400000000005s)]
*  we go to church every week, I just had my two eldest kids confirmed is fucking bullshit. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4723.280000000001s)]
*  Okay, I say that as a Catholic. Here's a scene in sat 34. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4730.4800000000005s)]
*  We don't know what's upside down. It's in. You just give it a [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4735.76s)]
*  in the lock into Jesus's house. [[01:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4745.12s)]
*  This is a church. So I was a person to be very respectful. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4754.72s)]
*  You're going to hell. Tell me something I don't know. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4766.400000000001s)]
*  Crackers. Oh my god, they have wafers here. They're snacking on them like triscuits. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4772.72s)]
*  Are we sure it's a Catholic church? Yes. They put jelly on them. [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4779.68s)]
*  She's also showing shoulders. [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4790.56s)]
*  Yes, the least of their problems. I know as a non Catholic, I take offense to that. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4792.72s)]
*  This is disgusting. I mean, I'm also Catholic practicing, but I'm not so scandalized. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4804.32s)]
*  You don't care. I mean, you're rarely scandalized. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4811.84s)]
*  Mm hmm. Sort of. I guess. Yeah, maybe. But with that, it's like, Hollywood is so secularized [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4814.88s)]
*  and hostile to Christianity and then Catholicism, especially because it's the main one. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4823.679999999999s)]
*  I was gonna say if that's true, they're just so secularized. Where is the film on [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4829.759999999999s)]
*  showing somebody drawing the so called Prophet Muhammad? [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4833.679999999999s)]
*  We're gonna make it. I'll help bankroll it. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4836.719999999999s)]
*  We'll be dead by 2026. That's the difference between Islam and Christianity. [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4840.56s)]
*  Catholics are easier targets. Yeah. Because of their own scandals and perceived hypocrisies. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4844.96s)]
*  And Catholicism, you know, through some fault of its own, has a lot of like, [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4852.16s)]
*  cache. And it's like a sexy bashing priests is like, don't leave your daughter or your son alone [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4858.96s)]
*  with them. I'd say, unfortunately, I think they did this on purpose to generate some kind of [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4864.8s)]
*  viral outrage or whatever. They were like, let's do some, what would be something, you know, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4870.8s)]
*  I can imagine the writers doing with their like, let's do something. Jewish guys in the writers. [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4875.68s)]
*  I'm not a diehard Catholic. I don't know scripture. Like I'm not one of those people. I listen to like [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4883.360000000001s)]
*  my pal, John Rich, talk about the Bible and I'm just I sit in awe just learning. But I am a believer [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4888.08s)]
*  and I'm a, I'm a Catholic. And I have to say like, that is the most sacrosanct thing they could take [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4896.48s)]
*  to bash. And having just been through my two kids, like my son should have been confirmed a year [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4903.28s)]
*  earlier, we just slept on the job. So he and his little sister, who's a year younger got confirmed [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4908.72s)]
*  at the same time. They as part of confirmation, they made the kids watch one of those videos about [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4914.24s)]
*  how sacrosanct the communion wafer is and how they genuinely believe it is the body of Jesus Christ. [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4921.28s)]
*  And about how our former Pope Pope Francis came from this diocese in Argentina where they did [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4930.5599999999995s)]
*  experience a miracle. They found a communion wafer on the floor of the church and somebody brought [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4939.2s)]
*  it to the church or to the priest to say, somebody must have dropped this. And there's a whole [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4944.96s)]
*  protocol they're supposed to go through when that happens. You have to like lock it up or whatever. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4949.84s)]
*  And they did that. And the thing was bloodied after a couple of days. They called in an outside [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4954.0s)]
*  agency. They tested it. They found actual like flesh DNA. You can believe or not believe that's, [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4960.4s)]
*  but I'm just saying for Catholics, we believe that that's the actual body of Jesus Christ. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4967.12s)]
*  And fuck you for using it for your PR. It's a sacrament. It's yeah, it's whole. It's absolutely. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4972.64s)]
*  But I think like people in entertainment understand that they have like plausible [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4979.4400000000005s)]
*  deniability because they can say, well, this is art. It's supposed to entertain you, titillate [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4982.240000000001s)]
*  you, make you think whatever it is safe. It's like the left loves to practice like safe racism [[01:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4987.04s)]
*  against Italians and Irish who happen to make up the bulk of the Catholics in the United States. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4993.36s)]
*  Right. Like probably arise. My people on both sides. Yeah. Well, I mean, well, charitably, [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=4998.4s)]
*  I'll say also maybe on the next episode, they get struck down by God. Oh, no, no, I think they do. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5003.2s)]
*  Yeah. Have you been watching? No, no, I'm just saying like, maybe they'll learn a hard lesson. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5009.12s)]
*  Who's on national review was, and he's very Catholic. He's a bunch of other Catholic than [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5013.679999999999s)]
*  I am. Maybe you too, but I don't know. But he's very devout. And he was saying something bad, [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5017.679999999999s)]
*  something very bad does happen to the characters. And so, yeah, I do think maybe there's divine [[01:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5022.4s)]
*  right. That's in service of a of a plot. I'm a little tipsy, so I'm just going to circle back to [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5027.36s)]
*  Zoran Mamdani for a minute because it just occurred to me that his parents gave him the name, [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5033.92s)]
*  the middle name Kwame, which has nothing to do with his heritage on either side to prime him [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5039.92s)]
*  for a life in politics, which is so much more sinister than any of this. That's what we should [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5044.799999999999s)]
*  really be exercised about. Yeah. Well, Maureen Callahan, who's got a show within the MK Media [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5050.96s)]
*  Network, opened her podcast, which has been a total hit, going off on Jon Hamm. And I was shocked [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5055.92s)]
*  because I loved Mad Men, Mad Men. And I loved Jon Hamm, like most people who enjoyed that show. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5063.12s)]
*  And she revealed this dark history of the guy where she found the police report where he [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5071.04s)]
*  absolutely hazed to the point of alleged criminality a kid in college, [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5078.88s)]
*  in like a fraternity. Yes, to where the kid had a broken spine and was like tortured by him, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5085.92s)]
*  allegedly, according to this police report. And if one word of it is true, the guy's a sociopath. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5094.16s)]
*  I was shocked. He's a male actor. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5100.64s)]
*  Shocked. Well, I can't like it was. But if you watch the show, you can sort of see [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5103.12s)]
*  playing the absolute asshole comes very easily to this guy. Yeah, maybe Don Draper wasn't so [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5110.08s)]
*  far out of his range. Maybe he's a great actor. He's just playing himself. Have you ever been [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5116.08s)]
*  across from somebody like that? You know, you were across from Greg. He was so good. What's his real [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5120.24s)]
*  name? Nick Braun. Yeah, in succession. He seems like a genuinely nice guy. Oh, yeah, he is. He's [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5124.32s)]
*  wonderful. I feel like he couldn't play that level of asshole the way John Hamm can. I wonder. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5129.2s)]
*  Well, he's in that movie Cat Person. Do you remember that story? I actually haven't seen it. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5136.0s)]
*  There was a story in The New Yorker that's about like a problematic age gap relationship. Yeah, [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5139.5199999999995s)]
*  they ended up making a movie. But yeah, how many years is too many? For us? I don't know. [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5144.48s)]
*  Well, we're on the topic. Yeah. What do you think? I mean, it's just a number. I think it more it [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5150.639999999999s)]
*  just depends. It's you know, if you're 50 and they're 70. But if you're 10, it's already, [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5156.16s)]
*  it's not even a moral question. It's a practical one, especially if you want kids. [[01:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5164.8s)]
*  Yeah, I think it just doesn't really just Yeah, I don't know. Like, I was surprised when I [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5170.08s)]
*  interviewed Caroline Levitt that she had a husband who is 30 years older than she is. I think she's [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5174.88s)]
*  27. And he's Wow, he's 56. Yeah. So how did they meet? I can't remember. She did tell me. I think [[01:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5180.32s)]
*  when she was running, she ran for office ran for Congress. And she met him then. But they fell in [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5188.4s)]
*  love. Now she's got a young baby. And it's working. I like when I kind of go by the woman, she seems [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5193.92s)]
*  like she's got her head on her shoulders. Right. So for whatever reason, who knows, you know, like, [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5199.04s)]
*  we all have weird things in our past that make us that drive our decision making. If it works, [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5204.0s)]
*  it works. Yeah, so far, it seems to be working for her. Yeah. All right, standby. We've got to [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5208.4s)]
*  take a break. And we're going to sip on these martinis some more. And then we'll pick it back [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5212.719999999999s)]

*  Valdoni. I'm very into this whole lawsuit because it's like completely self-destructive of her. I [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5336.88s)]
*  don't know if she's doing this because she has a self-destructive streak or because she just didn't [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5344.0s)]
*  anticipate the backlash she was going to be getting by making these claims, but they, in my opinion, [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5348.48s)]
*  have fallen apart claim by claim. Well, months since she made them. I don't know. Correct me. [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5353.44s)]
*  All this started because she was kind of being a bitch on the promotional tour. Yep. She, her [[01:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5359.92s)]
*  public conduct wasn't excellent. And so then she tried to deflect by implicating. Well, people [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5366.0s)]
*  noticed that she had unfollowed him and that he wasn't in any of the cast pictures. Meanwhile, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5374.96s)]
*  he's the co-star. They're equals in this movie. What is the movie? It's about domestic abuse. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5380.0s)]
*  And so he's the abuser and she's the abused. So it's like, it ends with us. Life imitates our. [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5384.88s)]
*  Well, yeah, that's what she would say. Yeah. And he's the director and it was his film. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5391.76s)]
*  He directed it. Yeah. He's wailing on her in the film. Right. Okay. He optioned the book. He got [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5396.24s)]
*  Blake Lively to star in it. And then things went south when she claimed she'd been me too on the [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5402.64s)]
*  set and they had to bring in, oh, Josh's dad is going to write a note about that. He doesn't. [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5407.52s)]
*  And it just spilled her martini on herself. So we're getting to that point of the program. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5412.96s)]
*  Anyway, so they've been now she filed an HR complaint with the California like Human [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5418.88s)]
*  Rights Council and leaked it to the New York Times. This is my memory. So double check me [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5425.2s)]
*  because I too am drinking the martini. But leaked it to the girls. You're basing yourself. I'm [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5430.96s)]
*  really not. Well, it's we only have like 10 more minutes of show. We got to get on it. Yeah. And [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5435.36s)]
*  he filed a defamation lawsuit against the New York Times. Then she after that filed the claim [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5441.92s)]
*  against him saying you harassed me. Then he counterclaimed against her saying you've been [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5447.44s)]
*  defaming me. These are lies. And now what we saw this week was just as represented by my lawyer, [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5451.839999999999s)]
*  Brian Friedman, who is who you want. If you know, he's an M effort in the best sense. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5458.48s)]
*  So she filed a claim against him a counterclaim for intentional infliction of emotional distress. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5466.879999999999s)]
*  And these are pretty notorious as bullshit claims in the law. And his lawyers, understandably, [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5474.0s)]
*  did what every defendant receiving one of these claims does, which is file a motion to compel her [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5482.08s)]
*  to turn over her medical records. So we could see the distress. Okay, you want us to pay you for [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5486.88s)]
*  your distress? What is it? What did you say to your psychiatrist? What, what expenditures have you had [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5493.36s)]
*  and like trying to fix it? Like a jury's gonna have to figure this out more entitled to see it. [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5499.12s)]
*  And she ran into court and said, Nevermind, I want to withdraw that claim. Okay. Okay. So either [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5503.76s)]
*  she just doesn't want us to see her medical records, like what she's been saying to her shrink, [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5511.76s)]
*  or the claims. Or the I think it's a former I think she doesn't want us to see the medical records. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5516.0s)]
*  God only knows what's in there. But he I mean, her her made adversary in life now has a legal [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5522.08s)]
*  right to see the records, which is a nightmare for her. But you shouldn't have filed that claim. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5526.72s)]
*  Any lawyer would have told her, This is a dangerous claim, because you're going to have to [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5530.96s)]
*  back all these claims up about how poorly you know, you've been affected, how terribly been [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5534.88s)]
*  affected by him. So she goes into the court and says, I want to dismiss those claims without [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5539.6s)]
*  prejudice, so that I can refile them all the way up to trial if I decide to. Can you explain that [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5545.280000000001s)]
*  you're the lawyer? It just means that when you dismiss it without prejudice, you can always [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5551.4400000000005s)]
*  refile. There's no downside to you. You pull your claim. It doesn't reflect poorly on you [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5555.04s)]
*  for having done that. Well, it might. But yeah, basically trying to like hedge your bets so that [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5560.08s)]
*  now she could go to a psychiatrist and be like, boo hoo. Okay, here are my records, right? Like [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5565.2s)]
*  between now and next March, which is when the trial schedule for she could spend every day in [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5570.4s)]
*  with a shrink being like, Justin's ruined my life. And then maybe she'd refile and be willing to [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5575.04s)]
*  turn over her records then I have no idea what's up this woman's sleeve. She's clearly in my opinion, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5580.8s)]
*  very devious and not trustworthy. So she asked the court if she could dismiss with prejudice [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5585.04s)]
*  and the court said no. This judge Lewis Lyman wrote citing here from variety and Tatiana Siegel [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5590.08s)]
*  on June 3, wrote that that day Baldoni's motion to compel these materials denied based on plaintiff's [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5600.08s)]
*  representation that the claims will be withdrawn. Blake Lively's request that because the parties [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5608.64s)]
*  have agreed to dismiss her causes of action on this front, the court should exercise its authority [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5613.52s)]
*  to dismiss these claims without prejudice is also denied. The parties must stipulate [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5619.52s)]
*  as to whether the dismissal is with or without prejudice. And the court says if the claims are [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5627.04s)]
*  not dismissed, the court will stop her from offering any evidence of her emotional distress. [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5633.52s)]
*  So she's not allowed to say she's had all this emotional distress and then not turn over these [[01:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5637.44s)]
*  records so that they can dispute it. So she just got majorly F'd. She's not going to she wanted to [[01:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5642.16s)]
*  proceed with this claim without offering any backup for it. And when his team said, let's see the [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5648.5599999999995s)]
*  proof, she pulled the claim, tried to keep the threat over them. And the judge said that is not [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5654.4s)]
*  going to happen. You're pulling the claim with prejudice, meaning you cannot refile it or your [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5659.839999999999s)]
*  claim stays and you turn over the records your choice. So well, she's really operating. I think [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5666.08s)]
*  she's just clearly operating on like a older me to model where those sorts of things wouldn't have [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5672.16s)]
*  been rejected or people would have taken them at face value or someone could have had a, you know, [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5678.4s)]
*  trial in the media that was then implicated them. I guess that's what she was trying to do to give [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5683.36s)]
*  him a trial in the media. I remember when I first caught wind of the story and fully understand what [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5689.28s)]
*  was happening and still don't understand it. I was like, oh, it's like two egomaniacs fighting, [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5693.52s)]
*  but I guess it's her really trying to smear him to ruin his life. I mean, she's like after he had [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5698.88s)]
*  the grace to put her in a movie. I know. And if you read the emails between them and the texts, [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5704.4800000000005s)]
*  this guy bent over, it was Blake Lively. Nobody really knew who Justin Baldoni was bent over [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5710.080000000001s)]
*  backwards as you expect to make her happy, to like make her feel good about her weird fashion [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5715.120000000001s)]
*  choices and her, you know, she was a little larger because she just had a baby. He was so nice to her [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5721.44s)]
*  about it, you know, like, but now in her lawsuit, she paints him as being a complete jerk. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5727.599999999999s)]
*  Create it up. Yeah. Yeah. That's what you get. Man, fellas, no good deed goes unpunished. [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5733.2s)]
*  Honestly. Well, on the subject of physicality, I want to ask you about this. It's in the cut, [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5740.08s)]
*  which is part of New York magazine, and they are taking aim at this woman named Liv Schmidt, [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5747.28s)]
*  who's a 23 year old model in New York who encourages their followers to quote, live the skinny girl [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5754.24s)]
*  lifestyle, skinny with an eye at the end of it by following her weight loss advice. [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5760.4s)]
*  They talk about this young, this 37 year old teacher named Emma, who broke up with her [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5766.08s)]
*  boyfriend. She, she stumbled on this woman's Tik Tok. Schmidt had more than 600,000 followers. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5770.24s)]
*  She's very beautiful. And it looks kind of like facetune Julia Fox. She's hot. They're, [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5775.52s)]
*  they're all facetuned. But New York cut is pointing out that in one video, she mocks women who wear [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5781.52s)]
*  sundresses to hide their puffy face and bloated bodies. And she wants to the Tik Tok for the [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5788.400000000001s)]
*  caption, girls be 300 pounds saying I'm a snack. No Megatron. You're the f in vending machine. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5793.52s)]
*  And they're taking aim at her for fat shaming. And they don't quite understand why she has so [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5800.0s)]
*  many followers who sign up for her DMS and her chat groups when they're trying to lose weight, [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5804.88s)]
*  like this gal Emma was, or stay thin. And talking about like her advice, they say they write about [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5811.28s)]
*  how she gives recipes, workout videos, diaries of everything she eats in a day. Members post [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5818.24s)]
*  their step counts, their meal plans and their before and after photos. And this gal Emma writes [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5824.56s)]
*  about how suddenly she felt weak and exhausted all the time. She was on the treadmill and she [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5829.44s)]
*  had to get off after a minute lightheaded and drenched in sweat. She wasn't quite doing that [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5836.32s)]
*  well and following the weight loss tips and that she, I guess many people feel like it's an [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5841.2s)]
*  unattainable like goal. The number, these number of steps and these low calorie diets and they [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5848.639999999999s)]
*  experience hair loss and dizziness. And is this really just encouraging anorexia? I've got my own [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5854.0s)]
*  thoughts on it, but I'm more interested in your takes. Well, what's your take? Well, the eating [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5859.12s)]
*  disorder community is one of the biggest female communities online and it's existed since the [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5863.5199999999995s)]
*  early days of the internet and continues to. So I don't know why Liv Schmidt is getting really [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5870.4s)]
*  talkative or like a culture that exists online around dieting. And she doesn't seem like she's [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5875.84s)]
*  even like, you know, where they're competitive tragically. And there are certain. Yeah, [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5884.0s)]
*  she's there are. And they combine like female vanity with like male autism because they're so [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5890.48s)]
*  obsessive about maintaining the low weight and like calorie counting. And it's not even like [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5896.32s)]
*  fun or cool. Yeah, it's like a cry for help. But in Liv Schmidt's case, that doesn't seem to be the [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5903.36s)]
*  case. I don't see what differentiates her from. I mean, there's so many lifestyle influencers. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5908.24s)]
*  Yeah. Well, my own take on it is somewhat jaded because when I was on NBC, I talked to this woman [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5914.0s)]
*  who was like incredibly fit. She just gave birth to three kids and she was basically like, [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5920.24s)]
*  what's your excuse if you don't look amazing? Because she just had three kids and she looked [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5924.24s)]
*  incredible. And this woman was talking about how she kind of regretted the message because [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5929.36s)]
*  she got a bunch of blowback. And she was just trying to say you can do it. She did it in artfully. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5933.84s)]
*  And I said to her when I was in law school, I used to say because I live with my mom and my [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5939.68s)]
*  stepfather for the last year. I'm like, if you see me get up to go back into that kitchen, please call [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5945.12s)]
*  me fat ass or say something negative to me to keep me out of there. And then it was Meghan McCain, [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5949.92s)]
*  frankly, but many others ginned up a backlash against me for like fat shaming. And I regret to [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5955.04s)]
*  tell you that I then went on the air and like apologized for it. Like, okay, I know. And now [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5961.92s)]
*  with the benefit of like some years between that episode and today, I'm like, you know what? Fuck [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5967.36s)]
*  those people who shamed me. That's how I stayed thin and I look good. And I don't judge people [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5971.6s)]
*  who don't go that course, but fuck those people who judged me. It helped me stay in shape and stay [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5977.84s)]
*  healthy. And by the way, not for nothing, but my the reason I had a stepfather who's now passed [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5982.72s)]
*  is because my actual father died of a heart attack at age 45. So it actually is really important to [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5988.8s)]
*  stay thin and watch your weight. I'm sick of people like, and you're just like, my dad died [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5994.96s)]
*  of a heart attack at 52 because he has diabetes, heart disease, the whole nine yards. So just way [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=5999.92s)]
*  more health risks to being overweight than there are to being underweight. Right. That's just the [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6005.12s)]
*  truth. It's the truth. Yeah. Like, okay, you lose some hair and develop osteoporosis. [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6009.6s)]
*  You're not going to have a heart attack. Though there's a cure to osteoporosis, [[01:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6015.36s)]
*  and yet we haven't figured out how to cure heart attacks. But I think people like, okay, [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6018.799999999999s)]
*  I'll put it this way. I think that people like Megan McCain, let's say who, by the way, I'm a big [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6023.759999999999s)]
*  Megan McCain truther. I think she's one of the most beautiful girls out there. She's just a little [[01:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6028.16s)]
*  heavy, but she has great bone structure. Like that's being a truther, a truther of baby people. [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6032.4s)]
*  Hey, people hate when I say that, but she is cute. I think people who are like overweight and [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6036.4s)]
*  struggle with their weight are jealous of people who are willing to have the discipline [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6044.32s)]
*  and the vanity to go through with it. That's really what it comes down. You're being hurt and [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6048.4s)]
*  shame. Yeah. And to just take accountability for your own. Yeah. Yeah. People when we first [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6054.4s)]
*  started the podcast, that was one of the first points of criticism leveraged against us was that [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6059.2s)]
*  we were fat. We would know that we were fat phobic that we made this far disparaging remarks, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6064.32s)]
*  people or whatever. And how did you handle it? We doubled down. Yeah. Why did I even ask? [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6069.52s)]
*  But here's what's so annoying about it. Like I come from a long line of fat people. My mother [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6078.24s)]
*  loves it when I say this, but I do. My Nana, her mom was obese. Yeah. She lived 101 by the way. [[01:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6084.08s)]
*  She's like crazy. My mom was always overweight. She's now on the thinner side, but she's 83. [[01:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6091.4400000000005s)]
*  My sister was morbidly obese and had a gastric bypass. Yeah. Wow. So like I have a long line of [[01:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6098.4800000000005s)]
*  heavy people who I love. You're kind of into this or compensating. Well, no, no, I just feel like I [[01:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6107.12s)]
*  will not be fucking shamed out of my opinion. Obviously I have nothing against overweight [[01:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6112.32s)]
*  people. You know, they're the people I've loved most of my life, but I also had my dad die very [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6116.24s)]
*  young on me at a young age. I'm like, I'm just not going to let this happen to me. I'm going to make [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6122.08s)]
*  different choices so that I can live. That's how I feel. And I also am much more vain than my Nana [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6126.48s)]
*  was or my mom. Well, that's what it comes down to. It's like some of us are more, more vain than [[01:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6133.36s)]
*  the others. And I think people really resent that because they see vanity as like a very grave sin. [[01:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6139.2s)]
*  And it's really not compared to all the other ones. Yeah. I mean, we all have, like, I don't [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6144.32s)]
*  see anything wrong with vanity because if it helps you stay thin, which is healthy, it's fine. I mean, [[01:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6148.719999999999s)]
*  all things, like it's good in moderation. Like I think if the vanity takes over your life and [[01:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6156.16s)]
*  makes it impossible for you to take care of your children or something like that. [[01:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6161.04s)]
*  You become a cat woman with the right. Yeah. I have seen this one, like Instagram influencer around [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6165.6s)]
*  who clearly has advanced anorexia and she somehow managed to give birth to children and she, [[01:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6171.84s)]
*  my God, they're like kind of involved in her like brand and that I find that upsetting. Yeah. [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6176.72s)]
*  That's it's all a separate mental. But we've like crossed over from this point of like, [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6184.4s)]
*  we used to bully fat people like when I was growing up in the 70s and that was wrong. [[01:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6189.36s)]
*  Yeah. I remember instances like that with my mom that upset me like or mean about her. And [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6192.48s)]
*  I hated that she's such a good, funny, amazing person. So I would never be that person. In no [[01:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6199.12s)]
*  way would I bully somebody who because eating is difficult to control for a lot of people. [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6204.799999999999s)]
*  Bullying and other things to make a statement of fact. And I feel like amongst like with my [[01:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6209.04s)]
*  influence, my family and like my other Russian friends, I feel like it is OK to just say, [[01:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6214.16s)]
*  hey, you're fat. I'm telling you that you're fat because I love you. [[01:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6219.68s)]
*  And I don't want you to be fat because you're going to get sick. Would you say that to your [[01:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6224.08s)]
*  friend? Some of them. Yeah. Have you said that to anyone? Eugene. Would you say to Anna? If she got [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6227.5199999999995s)]
*  fat, maybe if she got fat on my toes, you need that. Well, that's the thing now. Like, [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6236.16s)]
*  we have a daughter, don't you? A son. OK, so it's less a little less complicated. It's much better [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6244.72s)]
*  because he's naturally really skinny and his father. Well, you have to think about this stuff [[01:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6249.5199999999995s)]
*  when you have a daughter because you don't want to give her a complex. You don't want to give her a [[01:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6254.32s)]
*  complex. You definitely don't want to encourage an eating disorder, but you want to be honest [[01:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6258.32s)]
*  about like if you sit down and have a bag of Doritos at 12 o'clock at night, especially as [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6262.4s)]
*  you start to age, you will pay for it. Like, yeah, I mean, people are very nasty to me specifically [[01:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6269.2s)]
*  and they'll say like, it's a good thing she has a son, not a daughter, because if she had a daughter, [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6275.12s)]
*  she would really like ruin her life and her self-esteem. But that's like just not true. I [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6278.799999999999s)]
*  would much like I don't inflict my like political and ideological convictions on my child. I would [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6282.879999999999s)]
*  never ruin their perception of themselves because of my own like hang ups or whatever. But [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6290.48s)]
*  yeah, I think like you just have to as a parent, you just have to lead by example. It's not like [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6300.0s)]
*  the advice or the discipline you give them. It's how you live your life that really counts. That's [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6303.839999999999s)]
*  right. Well, I like what's the point of this whole piece in New York in the in the in the cut? I think [[01:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6308.32s)]
*  it's to, you know, under the auspices of taking like a fair and balanced look at this woman's [[01:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6315.2s)]
*  product. What they're really trying to do is shame her for being too quick to participate in shaming [[01:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6320.08s)]
*  young girls who are fat or like shaming fatness in general. Well, now it seems especially like [[01:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6326.96s)]
*  poorly timed because with Ozempic and stuff, like people who are formerly body positive like Adele [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6333.28s)]
*  probably some other they all go if they when they can they do they lose their way. Yeah, [[01:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6340.400000000001s)]

*  used to joke that if they really wanted to push those COVID vaccines on people, they would put [[01:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6367.6s)]
*  some Ozempic. He would have been rushing. I'll take the 25th shot. It's fine. I don't know. I [[01:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6370.88s)]
*  just feel like there's another element to this, to be honest, and it is attractive people have [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6380.240000000001s)]
*  their polls like there are studies that show they do better in society. They get they're quicker to [[01:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6389.120000000001s)]
*  get jobs. They're quicker to get promotions. And that can be like it doesn't mean you have to be [[01:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6394.08s)]
*  like born winning the genetic lottery, but it means it's better to stay put together. Like [[01:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6399.6s)]
*  put a little makeup on like a little cover up, like do your hair, buy a nice outfit, tuck in [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6406.24s)]
*  your shirt, like have good posture, walk in there looking put together. And if you can keep your [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6411.12s)]
*  weight at a healthy level, it will help. It's not to say you can't be trusted. And while that if [[01:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6418.56s)]
*  you're an overweight person, again, my own mom is. There's plenty of like fat geniuses who exude [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6426.160000000001s)]

*  She's so funny. But I was saying like, what I would like for my kids is that they keep it within [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6442.240000000001s)]
*  certain lines so that they stay well, they're perceived well, and they feel well. Yeah. I mean, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6447.52s)]
*  that's the health is really the biggest. But the left is still in a different place of like trying [[01:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6452.96s)]
*  to shame people out of saying that. What do you do to stay fun? I don't eat much. There you go. [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6457.6s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a low grade calorie restriction, which nobody wants to talk about. The best thing [[01:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6464.240000000001s)]
*  that happened to me was I have my like my primary care physician is is like a fattest, [[01:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6471.92s)]
*  is very against weight gain. So I'd go in there and I would have put on two pounds and he'd be like, [[01:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6479.68s)]
*  he'd yell it on two pounds. I was like, that's like water weight from like a Monday to a Thursday. [[01:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6485.52s)]
*  And he's like, Do you know how many two pounds adds up to be over 10 years, [[01:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6490.4800000000005s)]
*  you'll never lose 20 pounds, then you're fat. I know he's like really against gaining weight. [[01:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6494.08s)]
*  And it's not because he cares what I look like. It's because he shows me the chart every time I [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6500.96s)]
*  go in there of the number of diseases that go up your risk for all of them as you gain. Well, [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6505.12s)]
*  I think that's a lot of three out of four of my grandparents lived into their 90s. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6510.56s)]
*  And they were always like, in relatively good shape. And my father's generation, like the boomer [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6516.08s)]
*  generation really wasn't. And there's a bunch of like, political reasons for that with regards to [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6524.56s)]
*  the Soviet Union. But a lot of it is just like, keeping like, they were starving. They were [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6530.64s)]
*  starving. They were alive during any fee. And what do you guys do? Because you're both thin? [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6535.68s)]
*  Like, how do you stay thin? I do weight training. That helps if you build muscle. I do weight training [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6540.320000000001s)]

*  and like, eat moderately. Like I eat what I want. I do Pilates occasionally and weight chain and I [[01:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6551.12s)]
*  I don't like I'm not like a live to eat person anyway. So I do eat three meals a day. [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6558.5599999999995s)]
*  No, that's what my fattest doctor said. When I was 46. He goes when you're 50, you're not going to be [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6566.16s)]
*  able to eat at all anymore. I was like, well, we'll get it all in now. No more eating. I was like, [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6572.48s)]
*  what am I going to do? And he said, oh, mad, which stands for one meal a day. Oh, you know, I [[01:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6578.96s)]
*  do that. I heard that intermittent fasting and stuff like that is really bad for women specifically. [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6584.48s)]
*  It's still I have heard that but I do do it but I don't do it quite as radically as I used to. [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6589.759999999999s)]
*  I stop eating around 8pm. That's good. And then I usually have breakfast at 10am. So I'm on a 14 hour. [[01:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6594.08s)]
*  And I like that. And I read Dr. Dale Bredesen's book on the end of Alzheimer's. He's been on the [[01:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6602.48s)]
*  show. I'm very paranoid about getting all. Oh, yeah. And your family? No, but I'm just paranoid [[01:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6607.5199999999995s)]
*  about it. Like I like Sandra Doe O'Connor got it on the Supreme Court. Like anybody can get it. [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6612.48s)]
*  Yeah, you get this. It's terrible. Yeah. Just because you got to do the crossword. [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6616.959999999999s)]

*  everything in my power. No, it's good. But it's like that famous line that I keep quoting from [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6626.5599999999995s)]
*  John Cassavetes, husbands. And he's like, it's not the smoking or drinking that'll kill you. [[01:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6633.5199999999995s)]
*  It's the stress. Like if you stress out about things like you should have like a martini [[01:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6638.4s)]
*  every now and then. I don't stress and I do have the martini. So I'm not sure I have this. [[01:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6642.48s)]
*  You'll be you'll be fine. I think so, too. I feel like not being a stressed out person [[01:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6648.719999999999s)]
*  is well, it also makes you thinner because stress is like cortisol and gives you the midsection. [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6653.759999999999s)]
*  Well, that's the one downside of drinking is you go out drinking. Yeah, like not now in the middle [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6660.4s)]
*  of the day. But if we were to go out tonight, Friday night, and then wake up tomorrow hung over, [[01:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6664.4s)]
*  we'd all eat too much. Yeah, that's the biggest danger. No, it's the psyche. [[01:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6669.28s)]
*  So I don't know, they say like the the best exercise pushing yourself away from the table. [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6674.08s)]

*  came on and told me you should be eating grass fed, which I didn't even think of in my yogurt. [[01:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6693.599999999999s)]

*  salad with a little protein in it. And like two tablespoons worth of dressing that doesn't have [[01:52:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6726.24s)]
*  seed oil in it. And then at dinner, I have a protein and a vegetable. Yeah, and that's really [[01:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6731.679999999999s)]

*  you find the episode where we had our friends come on to talk about seed oils? And it was like [[01:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6886.4800000000005s)]
*  life changing. I was like, Oh, my God, what am I? What have I been doing? These seed oils, I'm [[01:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6893.36s)]
*  convinced are really bad. And give you bad fat. That's true. But harder to get rid of. It's hard [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6897.28s)]
*  to say because like, we're like Russians. So we, I think, just a lot of seed oil. Well, [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6904.56s)]
*  because we eat like sprouts and stuff. Wait, so you're backing seed oil? No, no, no, no, I [[01:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6910.080000000001s)]
*  agree with you guys. But like, I do fundamentally just I don't think it's as bad. I was very I [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6915.280000000001s)]
*  talked to a nutritionist at one point. And I told her I said something about seed oils. And she was [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6921.4400000000005s)]
*  like, What are you talking about? I was like, I was like, I was like, well, they cause inflammation. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6926.240000000001s)]
*  She was like, Are you worried about inflammation? Isn't every woman at this point? Well, at this [[01:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6930.8s)]
*  point, I was pretty underweight. And she was like, you need to you could be inflamed. She was like, [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6936.24s)]
*  you should just eat and not worry about. She's like, Don't worry about the peanut butter. They [[01:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6939.68s)]
*  were saying, by the way, I love peanut butter. Sometimes I'll have like an Ezekiel toast or just [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6945.84s)]
*  I'm into sourdough now. I started eating bread. Did you see that? Who did? When it's called Joe, [[01:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6951.2s)]
*  I've got a lot of issues with her. Well, but yes, but you know what? I respect her eating plan. [[01:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6957.84s)]
*  Like I love that she shares it with us. I have to say, she's weird. And I've got some objections to [[01:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6964.64s)]
*  this woman. But I like that she shares her eating plan and what she's learned. You can take it or [[01:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6969.84s)]
*  leave it. But like, I take that any day over these. I just drink a lot of water. Right? Yes. Liars. [[01:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6975.52s)]
*  Yeah. Bullshit artist. Does she still smoke a cigarette once a week or whatever? She's [[01:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6981.52s)]
*  I hope so. I saw her at one of my favorite New York City restaurants. Elio's. By the way, if you [[01:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6985.68s)]
*  need a place to go in New York, don't blow it up. I know there's that. But it's amazing. It's great. [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6992.56s)]
*  It's Italian and it's so good. Yeah. Upper East and the pasta. That's what you need to get. It's [[01:56:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=6997.92s)]

*  let me ask you this. Doug, does he he's just naturally thin because he's a guy or does he [[01:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7010.16s)]
*  try? He watches it. So Doug has a sweet tooth. That's his biggest risk. But he always says he's [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7015.76s)]
*  lived his life by if you put on a few pounds, cut a meal out or cut a meal in half. I'm like, [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7022.0s)]
*  that is the simplest. And it works that easy. Right. So he doesn't really do a ton of snacking. [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7029.68s)]
*  That's key. Snacking is kind of the devil. Snacking is the ball. Yeah, [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7036.8s)]
*  love snacking. It's it's like do something else. Drink a glass of water, go for a walk, call a [[01:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7041.4400000000005s)]

*  In a good way. He's like spelt. Yeah. I know they're amazing. I'm very jealous of men. I look at my [[01:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7060.16s)]
*  son. He has perfect eyebrows and eyelashes that I would pay good money for. And I'm just I literally [[01:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7065.6s)]
*  showed my lash extension girl a photo of my husband's eyes. He has like, are you getting the [[01:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7070.400000000001s)]
*  fake lashes on there? I have fake ones on now. So my but my concern I had those for a while when I [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7077.52s)]

*  No, you can't because if you're fair, it just looks weird and kind of trans. [[01:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7100.88s)]
*  I put my my makeup on heavily, you know, obviously for the show. Do you do your own makeup? Yeah. [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7105.36s)]

*  really understand why I was so interested in him. But I always really liked him. And he always made [[02:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7310.48s)]
*  me feel really like good. Your age, apropos. He's a little older, but like two years. I just did this [[02:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7316.32s)]
*  long interview with Jordan Peterson, which was actually really interesting. How's he doing? [[02:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7321.759999999999s)]
*  Better. Like health wise, he's better. It was a very interesting interview, I have to tell you. [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7327.839999999999s)]
*  Like it was one of the most interesting interviews I've ever given. Is it live now? Yeah, it's out [[02:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7334.5599999999995s)]

*  And when he came on the most recent time, we had a great hour and a half where he said all of his [[02:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7346.64s)]
*  things and I loved it. And when it ended, he said something like, you're very useful. [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7351.68s)]
*  What does that mean? It amused me. Well, I think Jordan's very focused and in a good way on what's [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7358.08s)]
*  happening to young men in our culture. And I think Jordan didn't know if I was like, [[02:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7366.64s)]
*  a raging feminist who was kind of the enemy. Or blood coming out of her. Well, like whether I [[02:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7373.360000000001s)]
*  was like this sort of like, I hate men kind of gal, he just didn't know me very well. [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7381.360000000001s)]
*  And so I think he was kind of like, checking it out. And when we talked on my show, he heard [[02:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7387.76s)]
*  enough to like satisfy himself that I wasn't a threat to what he stands for. That was my own [[02:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7393.44s)]
*  take. Then he invited me to go on his show. And he had a lot of negative things to say about like, [[02:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7399.28s)]
*  some women, which I didn't totally reject. Like, we're not perfect. And we haven't had a [[02:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7406.96s)]
*  uniformly perfect role in society and history and formation of humanity, etc. [[02:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7412.24s)]
*  But I we were it was an it was like there was some tension there because I think I'm more bullish on [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7419.4400000000005s)]
*  women than he is. Right. So I wanted to give him his valid points. But I also felt somewhat [[02:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7425.12s)]
*  defensive of our sex. I didn't want us to be grouped and disparaged as a group. [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7430.88s)]
*  Yeah. Well, in his like critiques of or like his mentorship of men, he's addressing inadequacy, [[02:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7435.68s)]
*  inadequacy that I feel like men, because they can't, they don't have as much to offer as they [[02:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7443.92s)]
*  used to. Women don't have the incentives to be as like, what do you mean? Because they're all [[02:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7451.52s)]
*  they're all like rendered? Well, they're all on either side has the incentive to commit to [[02:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7456.080000000001s)]
*  the other side, obviously. And I don't women not also, yeah, they don't want to be like the docile [[02:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7461.52s)]
*  kind of like, I don't know, Petersonian model of femininity, because men are not able to rise [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7468.08s)]
*  the occasion to like, well, let me ask you, let me ask you, because he said to me, he and his wife [[02:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7475.68s)]
*  are coming up with like, guidelines for young women on who and he raises a good point, it was [[02:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7481.04s)]
*  a legit point on how so many go career, and then realize too late, holy shit, totally forgot to [[02:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7487.76s)]
*  nurture relationships. Now I'm 38. Yeah, with no romantic prospects. And my eggs are not great. [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7495.44s)]
*  And I'm F'd, like, yeah, the available men don't necessarily, you know, who want kids, they're not [[02:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7503.5199999999995s)]
*  like, let me find a 38 year old, they're more like, let me find a 28 year old. And so that's real, [[02:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7510.24s)]
*  like, that was a legit dynamic that he was pointing out. And he was saying, like, we're trying to come [[02:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7515.759999999999s)]
*  up with these like guidelines for young women and like, consider doing it this way, because you've [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7519.36s)]
*  been misled by third wave feminists into thinking you can have it all and you can have it all at the [[02:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7523.2s)]
*  same time. And I just thought that was a very interesting proposition. And I think what they [[02:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7528.24s)]
*  were leaning toward, though he hadn't finalized it was like, do get married, do have kids in your [[02:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7533.92s)]
*  20s, and maybe push the career off until the 30s, where you will be able to generate something and [[02:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7538.72s)]
*  get something going. But like, you can't necessarily generate fresh young eggs. We're out here promoting [[02:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7545.36s)]
*  teen pregnancy. That's down across the board. I don't disagree exactly. But it's you. That was [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7551.12s)]
*  what when women were like, you know, trapped in traditionalist marriages where they didn't have [[02:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7558.64s)]
*  income. That's why it was so hard for them to leave because they it's not so easy to just start a career. [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7562.88s)]
*  So what would you say to him? [[02:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7569.84s)]
*  Um, yeah, that there's just has to well, it's just the, it's the dual income household is [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7572.4800000000005s)]
*  the real the realism of that's reality for most young people. So yes, you should have a job, [[02:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7580.4800000000005s)]
*  you should find a way to have some income. But you shouldn't like devote your life maybe to being [[02:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7587.280000000001s)]
*  the most successful in the field if what you want is a family and you just have to be honest with [[02:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7594.64s)]
*  yourself. It's hard to identify what you want in life and whether you want a family. I think [[02:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7600.0s)]
*  people young people struggle with that. Yeah, because we're all so brainwashed to kind of be [[02:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7606.24s)]
*  anti-natalist not want children because it's like an infringement upon our ambitions, our lifestyle, [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7611.92s)]
*  that sort of thing. And the PR around it has gotten so negative when it should be so positive. [[02:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7618.08s)]
*  Yeah. And I think like all the dating discourse that you see on the internet is profoundly like [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7624.32s)]
*  toxic and unsound because it's like reactive and retarded. And basically there's no way to [[02:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7627.84s)]
*  game the system. It is a crapshoot. It is unclear whether you will meet the person who's right for [[02:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7633.68s)]
*  you. That's just like what everybody has to reckon with. Well, he was raising a good point. [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7638.0s)]
*  Yeah, was that I'm going to botch this, but he was basically saying if you look at the averages of [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7642.32s)]
*  like a number of dating relationships, the average person will have they're relatively few. He said [[02:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7648.16s)]
*  it's like maybe five. Yeah, that makes sense. Each relationship is like a year or two. Yeah. [[02:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7654.64s)]
*  Plus the recovery time, right? Plus the time it takes to meet somebody new. Yeah. He's not wrong. [[02:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7661.12s)]
*  So you build that into the process from like 20 forward. Then you are looking at like age 30, [[02:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7666.64s)]
*  by age 30, those have happened. Yeah. I was like, God, this is really stark. But then there are [[02:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7672.8s)]
*  situations like mine where I did marry somebody age 30 and I divorced that person at age 35. [[02:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7679.28s)]
*  And later in my 35th year, I moved out from Dan in February of 2006. And I met Doug in July of 2006. [[02:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7685.04s)]
*  Can happen, but everybody always looks at me and they're like, Oh, that's extraordinary. [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7692.8s)]
*  It's like one in a million. Your career is one in a million. And I don't I'm more of the abundance [[02:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7696.96s)]
*  mindset that we discussed earlier. I'm like, it's not one in a million. You can manifest it [[02:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7701.599999999999s)]
*  for yourself too. And then when I say that people call me like a fourth wave feminist, [[02:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7705.68s)]
*  like you're just a conservative feminist. I'm like, no, I'm an optimist. Yeah. Power of positive [[02:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7710.72s)]
*  thinking. Yeah. Yeah. Retain, maintain hope. Yeah. That's how I feel. I go like, it will happen for [[02:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7715.76s)]
*  you if you make it happen for you. If you believe it can happen. And then you like you have to [[02:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7721.4400000000005s)]
*  manifest it. I know that sounds nuts. But I believe in it. And but you have to also be willing to make [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7725.92s)]
*  sacrifices like we were talking about this recently that so much of the like dating market [[02:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7731.2s)]
*  conversation is so problematic because so many people men and women like overvalue them. [[02:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7737.599999999999s)]
*  What can you do for me versus what can I do for you? Yeah, this is what Jordan would say too. [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7745.44s)]
*  I mean, it's a lot of women are like, he's not good enough. Right. What are you? What are you? [[02:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7750.32s)]
*  What are you bringing to the table? And it's like, it's unfathomable for me to go into a relationship [[02:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7755.28s)]
*  thinking like, what what can he do for me? Can he pay my bills? Can he like make me feel good [[02:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7760.32s)]
*  about myself? Like, that's the wrong narcissistic way of going about it. You have to ask yourself [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7764.88s)]
*  whether you're willing to love another person. And of course, they have to be in on the game [[02:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7772.96s)]
*  to as to be a mutual thing. But it's outrageous that people I mean, you should expect a baseline [[02:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7777.2s)]
*  of like positive treatment and like love and care and affection. But people expect so much from [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7782.5599999999995s)]
*  another person without giving anything in return. Well, that's the thing. Now that's that's it right [[02:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7788.4s)]
*  there. Yeah. Like, I've taken heat for saying, you know, I want to be a working woman, which I am. [[02:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7793.12s)]
*  But I still want Doug to open my door for me. Yeah. And I want him to do all the gentlemanly [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7800.96s)]
*  things that he does for me. And people say like, Oh, what is that? You know, like, what is so what [[02:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7805.759999999999s)]
*  what are you committing to? But my own feeling is there's nothing incongruous with those two goals. [[02:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7809.92s)]
*  I also am a working woman, but feel like I have primary responsibility generally for the housework. [[02:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7815.12s)]
*  We haven't made I'm not gonna I'm not trying to fool anybody. But like, as between me and Doug, [[02:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7822.48s)]
*  I'm more likely you manage the household. Yes, I am. And I'm more likely to like, I mean, I take [[02:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7827.76s)]
*  care of all like, yeah, presents and birthdays, like celebrations, like I know that's in like, [[02:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7832.64s)]
*  that's what are the dinner plans like, that's generally women's work. And I'm fine with that. [[02:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7837.12s)]
*  I don't I don't mind that I enjoy it. Like, I love taking care of him in that way. And there are [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7841.68s)]
*  other ways to like, I would have fun with right, like, you know, we have this sort of a typical [[02:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7846.4800000000005s)]
*  on paper relations, just just given my success in broadcasting, right? I like being more [[02:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7852.08s)]
*  traditionalist in some ways, I don't think it is incongruous. No, not at all. I think there's no [[02:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7858.16s)]
*  problem in setting out those honest truths, which are your life will be happier if you have a partner [[02:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7863.12s)]
*  and children, I just think that's just true. And people should be told that and then they should [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7870.08s)]
*  be told the realities of fertility. Because those are realities that you know, can be potentially [[02:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7874.64s)]
*  meddled with, but there's no guarantee. And if you cannot, if you're one of the people who cannot [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7880.32s)]
*  meddle with it, and you miss your window, it will be a lifelong regret that will be unsolvable and [[02:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7885.28s)]
*  will be like a deep source of pain, an ongoing deep source of pain. So it's not something that [[02:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7890.16s)]
*  you could easily brush off. And so all those truths need to be shared while at the same time [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7896.16s)]
*  pricing and sharing the fullness of the rewards of motherhood with young women, which isn't done. [[02:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7900.72s)]
*  We should all go on Jordan the next time together. That would be fun. [[02:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7907.599999999999s)]
*  Hey, hey, hey, hey. You guys should go on with him. I actually want to make that happen. [[02:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7910.639999999999s)]
*  We've been trying to get him on our show. Oh, well, I'll not like that. [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7914.08s)]
*  Yeah, he would really enjoy this. He loves intellectuals. [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7918.8s)]
*  But he I taught I don't know if I should say this in loud, but I know like his assistant or [[02:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7921.92s)]
*  probably I don't know what this guy does for him. But he mentioned that like, they just have very [[02:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7929.36s)]
*  like hard quotas for like viewership or something like that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. [[02:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7933.599999999999s)]
*  So that makes sense. Like very bottlenecked. Yeah. Oh, yeah. But you know, did you see his debate? [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7939.44s)]
*  Which one? He went on that Jubilee. Oh, they asked me to go on Jubilee. Oh, don't do it. [[02:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7945.04s)]
*  I said, I don't do it. You're way better than that. I just feel like this is not my jam. [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7951.28s)]
*  Well, they had him debating as a Christian debating 20 atheists. Oh, no. But then one of the [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7957.5199999999995s)]
*  Christians or atheists asked him point blank if he was a Christian and he wouldn't say that he was. [[02:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7964.88s)]
*  What? He changed the title of the YouTube video to like non-atheist. That's actually quite clever. [[02:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7970.719999999999s)]
*  That kid made news. Yeah. He was a little annoying and trollish, but he got his point across. [[02:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7979.52s)]
*  So Jordan's not a Christian. He wouldn't identify as a Christian, at least. Yeah. Even in the [[02:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7986.16s)]
*  purposes of this debate where he was a sci-o agent. Yeah. Yeah. Well, that's actually really [[02:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7992.16s)]
*  interesting. Now that makes me want to watch it. But I just thought like, why do I want to debate [[02:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=7996.72s)]
*  a bunch of possible know nothings on my core issues? About what? Did they even give you a [[02:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8001.6s)]
*  suggestion? They let it be up to me. But I was like, I. Lazy. Plus, I'm not like, [[02:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8006.88s)]
*  I'm not that person in the culture. I'm not like a culture warrior. I have thoughts, [[02:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8012.56s)]
*  but I'm more about facilitating conversations than being like a main debater and killer of other [[02:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8016.96s)]
*  people's points. I'd be more likely to be like, oh, that's actually really interesting. Go on. [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8022.400000000001s)]
*  You know, then being like, you're wrong. You suck. So I don't think I'm right for that show. But [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8027.68s)]
*  now it's my kids. It's fun. Have you? Have you been on it? I mean, I won't. [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8033.84s)]
*  I might go on. He goes on it. OK. And Charlie Kirk goes on it. And Jordan. Like these are, [[02:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8041.4400000000005s)]
*  you know, they're combative. I know people think I'm combative, but I'm not exactly combative like [[02:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8047.76s)]
*  that. I'm only combative when you stumble upon one of my core issues, which tend to be just natural [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8052.16s)]
*  truths and you're lying about them. Yeah. You're not you're not trying to own people. No, not at [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8057.360000000001s)]
*  all. And they are because they're dudes. No, I'm a learned adult. I don't know at all. You know, [[02:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8061.92s)]
*  anyway, it's so much fun. I don't even know what it's 230. We've been here forever. We got to go. [[02:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8068.32s)]
*  You're not getting paid extra for this. I'm not getting paid at all. I don't get paid. [[02:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8074.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's been a pleasure. You guys. Thank you so much for being here. So fun. The ladies [[02:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8078.0s)]
*  of Red Scare, everybody. Only one team like this. Such a pleasure. Thanks for joining us tomorrow. [[02:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8083.92s)]
*  Well, tomorrow we're off because it's Saturday. It says tomorrow. T's ahead to guess this week. [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8089.92s)]
*  We have nobody. But we have Charlie Kirk coming on Monday. And in the meantime, I hope you have [[02:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8094.4s)]
*  a great, great weekend. Go ahead and download the Megyn Kelly show on Apple, Pandora, Spotify, [[02:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8098.48s)]
*  or Stitcher. I mean, honestly, I got to be honest. Maybe you should download on Spotify because we [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8103.5199999999995s)]
*  got completely F'd over by Apple about a week ago where they didn't download the show. We have no [[02:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8107.599999999999s)]
*  idea why they didn't download the show. People who listen to the show on Apple had to go like [[02:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8113.44s)]
*  nine hours waiting for it to appear. No one would talk to us. At least Spotify talks to us. [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B1wVwjUkvAg&t=8117.84s)]
