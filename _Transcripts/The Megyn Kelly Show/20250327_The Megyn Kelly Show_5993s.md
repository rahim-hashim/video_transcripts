# Absurd Signalgate Spin, NPR Exec Grilled, and Biggest Media Hacks in America, with Ruthless Podcast
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Oh, they're still on freaking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Signalgate everywhere. Would you like move on? It's not going away. The Democrats are so excited. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5.36s)]
*  They've got something juicy that makes the Trump administration look bad to talk about. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=13.76s)]
*  And for some reason, the Trump administration does keep talking about it, which I like, [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=17.36s)]
*  just stop. There's, it's pointless. You have so many good things you can talk about that don't [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=22.080000000000002s)]
*  involve this egg on the face situation. But they all are. So we will too, to some extent. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=26.24s)]
*  Way more delicious is what happened on the Hill yesterday with NPR and PBS. My God, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=34.48s)]
*  if you listen to the AM update this morning, that's our new morning show with just the news [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=40.239999999999995s)]
*  headlines, which I think you'll like. My friend Donna, you know, she listens to the show every [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=43.92s)]
*  day. My closest friend from law school, she says, you're starting to get spicy or your personality [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=50.32s)]
*  starting to come through more in the day. First off, we started out Walter Cronkite like with our [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=54.88s)]
*  delivery. Now we're, we're getting a little looser. In any event, I think you'll like it. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=58.72s)]
*  We talked about some of the soundbites. We played some of the soundbites and oh my God, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=62.96s)]
*  we have so many more. It was so fun. It's wonderful to see these left-wing hacks get called out [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=66.4s)]
*  explicitly for their left-wing hackism. And we'll do more of that here. Plus it's March Madness, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  which means it's hack madness too. Speaking of hacks, it's hack madness. What do I mean? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=79.28s)]
*  Well, what media hacks are performing well in their ruthless brackets? There's only one group [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=84.56s)]
*  of fellas that have the answer to that. And they are Josh Holmes, Michael Duncan, John Ashbrook, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=91.60000000000001s)]
*  and comfortably smug, the hosts of the ruthless podcasts or variety program. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=97.44s)]
*  That's a ticking time bomb. But here's the good news. You have the power to take control naturally [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=114.88s)]
*  with 120 Life. 120 Life is a blend of great tasting super fruit juices that can actually [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=120.24000000000001s)]

*  Thanks for having us. I love, love, love the NPR story so much. And I hate, hate, hate the Signal [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=171.36s)]
*  story. Not because it makes the Trump administration look bad. I'm happy to talk [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=178.64000000000001s)]
*  about stuff that makes the Trump administration. I don't care. I'm obviously a Trump supporter. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=181.84s)]
*  Still, the news is the news. But this one's just so pointless. No one's saying anything new. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=186.56s)]
*  We're going back and forth arguing about whether it was war plans or attack plans. And is Mike [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=192.8s)]
*  Walsh more culpable because he appears to have added Jeffrey Goldberg to the thread? Or is it [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=199.28s)]
*  Pete Hegseth who released? Was it classified information or is it not classified? Because [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=203.6s)]
*  as defense secretary, he's declassifying it by sharing. I don't care. The Houthis are dead, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=209.36s)]
*  which we're really happy. The average person is like, dead Houthis, cool. And probably should [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=216.16s)]
*  take it off Signal for the next one and get rid of the nasty reporter. Don't you think that's how [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=222.16s)]
*  most normal people are reacting to this? 100%. No question about it. I mean, we did our entire show [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=227.92s)]
*  basically on this today. And look, the upshot of this thing is that every administration makes [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=233.83999999999997s)]
*  some kind of mistake. The previous administration, their mistake cost their team Marines their lives. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=239.67999999999998s)]
*  This administration added a reporter to a text chain and then, and then happened to run a flawless [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=245.51999999999998s)]
*  mission against the Houthis, which was a 17 month in the making problem where they had 175 [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=252.64s)]
*  separate attacks on US Navy personnel. While the Biden administration did absolutely nothing, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=260.64s)]
*  Donald Trump's in office all of eight weeks, boom, taken care of Suez Canal reopened, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=265.84s)]
*  an Iran funded terror operation destroyed. Okay, you know, like in the matter of scandal, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=271.2s)]
*  where does this rank? I mean, for me, overwhelming success. Now granted, they shouldn't have any [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=278.08s)]
*  external communication with the heads of national security apparatus that includes a reporter. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=285.84s)]
*  They know that they acknowledge as much literally the day after. It did not mean it. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=290.15999999999997s)]
*  Right. And the president, in fact, took it straight on. He said, here's the way [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=295.84s)]
*  that I would prefer we handle this. And he talked about the lead ceilings and lead walls, [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  basically describing the situation room. And that should make perfectly clear to anybody going [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=304.64s)]
*  forward. The way the president sees this, it was a screw up. He's standing by his people because, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=310.47999999999996s)]
*  oh, by the way, they executed a perfect mission, which was the whole point of this. And by the way, [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=315.84s)]
*  an afterthought in the media. Yeah. But but ultimately, yeah, I mean, that's why you stand [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=320.88s)]
*  by your national security folks clearly a screw up, but we'll do things differently and move on. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=326.32s)]
*  Story's done as far as I'm concerned. Yeah, right. I know it's like they want to scalp. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=330.88000000000005s)]
*  And, you know, yesterday, with all due respect to Dave Portnoy, they actually raised Dave Portnoy's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=336.88000000000005s)]
*  name at the White House press briefing. Some reporter was like, well, Dave Portnoy, even Dave [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=343.12s)]
*  Portnoy was laughing about the fact that they took his commentary and elevated it to the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=348.48s)]
*  presidential level. Like, well, what do you have to I mean, Dave Portnoy is calling for someone to get [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  fired. He wants Mike Walsall to be fired. What are you like? What are we doing? If Dave Portnoy [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=356.64s)]
*  tells me not to go to a certain place for pizza, I'm very interested. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=363.52s)]
*  If he has something interesting to say about sports about which I know nothing, I'm interested. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=367.84s)]
*  His social commentary is fun. But whether someone needs to get fired over Signalgate, I'm out. And [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=372.8s)]
*  I certainly would never be so dumb as to raise that with the White House, which I think Portnoy [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=379.2s)]
*  agrees with me on. Yeah. I mean, I think that pretty much gives away the whole game of what [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=384.96s)]
*  is exactly happening right now with our media. You've got the establishment media that's in that [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=390.71999999999997s)]
*  White House briefing room. And they're concerned with Dave Portnoy's thoughts on what happened [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=396.23999999999995s)]
*  here. Only because it runs against Trump. They don't care about it. They don't care about actual [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=401.59999999999997s)]
*  news. They don't care about what Americans got from that story, which is, oh, wow, terrorists [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=406.24s)]
*  got blown up. Terrific. They're trying to make this some process, gossipy, juicy story when [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=410.48s)]
*  there's nothing there to discuss. They're like, well, Dave Portnoy said this. It's like, maybe [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=416.72s)]
*  you're a little bit way too online here. You're using your time in the White House press briefing [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  room to talk about Dave Portnoy's thoughts. I know. And Portnoy is a heck of a showman. He's a [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=424.56s)]
*  heck of a showman. But he's no showman compared to Donald Trump. And that's my recommendation of the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=429.44s)]
*  Trump administration is change the conversation. You just arrested one of these top gang leaders [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  of MS-13 in Virginia. I don't know, bring them into the briefing room. You know, we can dissect [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=439.84s)]
*  all of his tattoos. We can ask Robert Costa, do you think this guy is a gang member of MS-13? He [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=444.96s)]
*  is an MS-13 in calligraphy on his chest. Dave Portnoy, is this or is this not MS-13? They're [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  trying, but that won't do it because that's good news for the Trump administration. And the left [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  wing media that's driving this story won't go along with it. But what's been remarkable to me, [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=463.59999999999997s)]
*  because if you search all the news sites, and obviously that's my job, they're all still on it, [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=467.6s)]
*  everyone. I mean, everything online, all the print papers completely on Signalgate. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=474.56s)]
*  And so are all of the more establishment Republican media outlets, right? Like the [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=479.28000000000003s)]
*  Wall Street Journal's all over it. National Review's got like four pieces up on how somebody needs to [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=486.0s)]
*  get fired and how terrible this is. I mean, I love National Review, but they're really turning into [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  never Trumpers. Like they're starting to read much more like The Dispatch and they should watch it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=496.88s)]
*  I love those guys, but they need to rein that in a bit because it's all Trump bashing. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=502.24s)]
*  So, but my takeaway is the people who wanted, and it's in particular about Hegseth, Hegseth to have [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=507.28s)]
*  nothing to do with the Pentagon, and we're totally against his elevation to that post, are the loudest [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=515.84s)]
*  critics in this scandal. They think there's blood in the water. They're trying to change the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=522.48s)]
*  conversation from Mike Walls to Pete Hegseth, even though, and I don't think either one should be [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=527.2s)]
*  fired, but even though it was Mike Walls who added this Jeffrey Goldberg to the Atlantic, [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=532.08s)]
*  Pete Hegseth didn't do that. Pete Hegseth trusted the National Security Advisor that this was an [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=537.04s)]
*  appropriate place to have this conversation and that he who had created the group, Walls, [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=543.52s)]
*  had screened everyone appropriately. That was Pete's sin, right? And then had a frank conversation [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=547.76s)]
*  about the plans as was obviously requested by Mike Walls and the others who were on there, [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=553.52s)]
*  including the Vice President. But I really think it's all these people who hated Pete [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=559.8399999999999s)]
*  who will not let this die because they think they can get a scalp. And I'm here to tell you, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=564.7199999999999s)]
*  it's not gettable. He's not getting fired. You're going to have to cry harder. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=569.28s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's right. Yeah, no, I think that's exactly right. You look back at what did [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=572.72s)]
*  Joe Biden do when it comes to the Houthi terrorists? He took them off the terrorist list. What did Pete [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=577.76s)]
*  Hegseth do? He killed them. And so this is exactly what people voted for. They wanted action out of [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=582.5600000000001s)]
*  this president's. What Trump told people he was going to do. He came in and he started acting. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=587.9200000000001s)]
*  And I mean, we talk about the mainstream media and you're saying that they don't want the [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=592.88s)]
*  conversation to go away. Well, the one guy who's going away is this top leader at MS 13. Another [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=596.64s)]
*  action that the president has taken. We talked about it a second ago. But like this guy is acting [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  every single day in a way that voters wanted. And that's why his approval rating and the right [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=608.16s)]
*  track number that everybody follows is so high. I don't know if you saw this poll from Marist just [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=613.76s)]
*  this week. It showed that the right track number is higher than it's been in 20 years. And Democrats [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=618.56s)]
*  are scammed or scrambling. And when you say Democrats, you have to include the mainstream [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=625.2s)]
*  media in that group of people. They're also scrambling, trying to figure out what they can [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=630.96s)]
*  do to get out from under Trump's popularity and just incredible start in these first two months. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=636.08s)]
*  I think it's also worth a little trip down memory lane when we're talking about the press here. And [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=641.36s)]
*  you're right. They're trying to get a scalp, whether it's Pete or Waltz or whatever they ask [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=647.0400000000001s)]
*  incessantly about whether or not one of them are going to get fired. How many of those same [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=650.8s)]
*  journalists talked about Afghanistan withdrawal in the same way? Who is going to get fired? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=655.28s)]
*  Of course, nobody got fired. Right. And it costs 13 Marines their lives. But also the story was [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  sort of a process story about, well, Trump wanted to get out of Afghanistan, too. Everybody wanted [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=667.28s)]
*  to do this thing and move on. And you look at some of the Democrats like Chuck Schumer, we had the [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=672.0s)]
*  highlighted on our show. He had exactly one thing on all of X over the last five years that [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=676.16s)]
*  contained the word Afghanistan, where there was no call for an investigation. There was no discussion [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=682.88s)]
*  about what went wrong. He condemned terror. Right. And now he's saying that every single American's [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=689.04s)]
*  life is at risk because of an operation that happened 10 days ago, which was a resounding [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=694.88s)]
*  success. Like this doesn't, it strains credibility. Yeah. Yep. 100%. And so now you've got Jeffrey [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=701.52s)]
*  Goldberg moving into saintly status of the Atlantic, this complete left wing hack who has never seen [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=708.0799999999999s)]
*  Republican catnip that he hasn't sniffed and rolled around in and peddled to his viewers as real, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=716.8s)]
*  right? From Russiagate to the fawning piece he did on Mark Milley for like holding the line [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=723.04s)]
*  against this dictatorial Trump, the guy who was going to tell the Chinese if we were going to [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=731.12s)]
*  unleash an attack on them. Which by the way, no one was even planning. Only Mark Milley's head [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=735.92s)]
*  was Trump going to go attack the Chinese. We didn't attack the Chinese. Trump didn't give the order [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=741.68s)]
*  to go attack the Chinese, but Mark Milley decided to take it upon himself to in a treasonous [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=746.24s)]
*  communication, tell his counterpart in China, if we are going to drop any bombs on you, I will give [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=751.04s)]
*  you the heads up. That's crazy. Which is totally, I mean, insubordinate is another statement, but [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=756.16s)]
*  he's a patriot in the eyes of the Atlantic. Okay. So Jeffrey Goldberg goes out there like, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=761.52s)]
*  I'm the dignified one here. Okay. They added me because I'm important. Obviously I'm in everybody's [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=768.16s)]
*  phone, not mine. Mike Walz is even saying not in his. No, I have to say to be honest, that sounds [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=773.12s)]
*  like bullshit to me. He does, I mean, I don't know how he'd get added from Mike Walz's phone if he [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=779.12s)]
*  weren't in there. Walz in a very awkward exchange with Laura Ingram seemed to be trying to say, [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=784.0s)]
*  it'd be like if I texted you something Holmes and said, Hey, you know, great having you on the show [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=790.4s)]
*  today. Doug, my husband wanted to send you something. And like I CC Doug on the communication. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=797.04s)]
*  You know how like I added him in. So you didn't have Doug in the community in your contacts, [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=804.32s)]
*  but like sometimes your phone would recognize, Oh, this is Doug, right? Like it might say [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=810.16s)]
*  at a future point, if you're searching for a Doug, it might pull that up because there is some AI on [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=817.4399999999999s)]
*  your phone that does that for you. He seemed to be suggesting Goldberg was part of a different [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=821.92s)]
*  conversation he had with somebody. And that's somehow how I have no idea. Okay. Yeah. Back to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=826.48s)]
*  my main point, all these thoughts. So Goldberg goes out there and he's like, I didn't, I didn't [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=831.52s)]
*  want to do any of it. I'm so sad that they're making me do this, but I feel, you know, an [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=836.48s)]
*  obligation to tell you how insecure, unsecure these comms are and that I had war plans. And he [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=840.88s)]
*  went all over the news media on Tuesday saying, I'm not, I'm not going to release the stuff they [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=849.44s)]
*  texted about the war plans because it's too incendiary. It's really, it's going to compromise [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=855.6800000000001s)]
*  our military. So that I won't do. And here's a little bit of how he sounded on Tuesday. Watch [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=861.2s)]
*  that too. The last thing I want is to see American lives endangered in any way. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=865.84s)]
*  Let me, which is why you didn't include it. And Jeffrey, you rightly didn't publish, of course, [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=872.0s)]
*  the details of everything you saw in that exchange. So I don't expect you to repeat them here. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  I don't want to go into details because I don't think it's responsible to put out operational [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=880.5600000000001s)]
*  issues. And as much as I enjoy national security investigative reporting, I don't, I don't need [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=886.32s)]
*  strike plans two hours before a launch. That's not, that should not be coming into my phone. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=892.8s)]
*  I mean, I take this stuff very, very seriously. The White House press secretary said you're lying. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=898.9599999999999s)]
*  I said there are no war plans there. I've said there's no classified information. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=903.3599999999999s)]
*  So the obvious question is, shouldn't you now demonstrate it? Shouldn't you publish the text? [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=907.28s)]
*  No, because they're wrong. I have a pretty, I have a pretty clear standards [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=912.56s)]
*  in my own behavior of what I consider information that I consider to be in the public interest. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=917.4399999999999s)]
*  Even if it's technically classified or not, I'm, I'm sticking to my principles here. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=922.72s)]
*  Sticking to his principles. Okay. So just for the record, this is, that was him and the messaging [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=928.8000000000001s)]
*  up and down television on Tuesday for whatever it's worth. This, this is what I said on Tuesday. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=933.36s)]
*  I, by the way, I think we're T minus like 72 hours before Jeffrey Goldberg releases it anyway, [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=938.32s)]
*  with maybe a couple of things redacted, but I, I don't think he's going to stay in this. Like I, [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=943.44s)]
*  I'm above it all and I won't release it. He just, I don't think he can help himself. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=948.4s)]
*  And I was a hundred percent right. Except for the redacting part. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=953.52s)]
*  24 hours later. Yeah. You were exactly right. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=956.72s)]
*  So he releases it all virtually at 99.99% has been released. I think he withheld the one name [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=959.6800000000001s)]
*  of the one guy. But the whole, all the, I wouldn't be responsible. I take this stuff very, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=966.0s)]
*  very seriously. No, I shouldn't publish it. Be wrong. I have clear standards out the window. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=971.0400000000001s)]
*  Not a single redaction. Read it all. Please click on the Atlantic. [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=976.64s)]
*  It's, it's the kind of turn that would make Nancy Kerrigan wish she could do it. I mean, [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=981.6s)]
*  it was a full double axle, triple toe loop. The guy in 24 hours was so esteemed and he's never [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=985.84s)]
*  going to do it because of principle. And then he's like, you know what? Yeah, let's get some more [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=992.48s)]
*  publicity. Also a special hats off to your researchers, Megan, who had to sift through [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=997.36s)]
*  Tim Miller and MSNBC and all of that. I mean, that's enough to give somebody brain damage. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1001.84s)]
*  You're some kind of a cop reward for something like that. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1006.96s)]
*  Hazard pay. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1010.72s)]
*  It was just, it's unbelievable. So this guy's been turned into some sort of a hero and pick your [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1013.76s)]
*  poison. I mean, if you are pro Europe, you're blaming this all on JD Vance. Like he said [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1020.08s)]
*  terrible things about our best friends, but how they needed to take care of this. If you are anti [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1026.56s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, you're saying he needs to get fired. A lot of the sort of pro more neo Connie guys, [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1032.1599999999999s)]
*  much prefer Tim Walls. I mean, sorry, not Tim Walls, Mike Walls. So there's like different [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1037.9199999999998s)]
*  constituencies coming out. And Mike, Mike Walls with Laura Ingraham claimed he will get to the [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1043.6799999999998s)]
*  bottom of it, which I believe we will. And he said he's brought in a special helper to do that. Take [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1050.48s)]
*  a listen here. It's not three. It's embarrassing. Yes. We're going to get to the bottom of it. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1056.48s)]
*  I just talked to Elon on the way here. We've got the best technical minds looking at how this [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1062.3999999999999s)]
*  happened, but I can tell you, I could tell you for 100%. I don't know this guy. I know him by his [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1066.8799999999999s)]
*  horrible reputation and he really is the bottom scum of journalists. And I know him in the sense [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1074.1599999999999s)]
*  that he hates the president, but I don't text him. He wasn't on my phone. And we're going to figure [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1079.84s)]
*  out how this happened. Okay. I don't, I mean, I guess it's good to have Elon and his tech bros, [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1084.6399999999999s)]
*  right? Way in, but like they need to stop going on shows and talking about it. Do they? Am I wrong? [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1093.04s)]
*  Just stop it. So I don't know. Like Elon flies rockets to Mars. He might be a little overqualified [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1100.72s)]
*  for this job, but I love how Elon is now like generic IT guy for the entire government. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1106.08s)]
*  Like his shirt says. It's like the way you guys treat me around here. Like the internet goes out [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1112.0s)]
*  and you're like Duncan the router. Did you plug it in? Did you take the plug out? That's it. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1116.48s)]
*  That's like when I married Doug, he was running an internet security software firm. Like they [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1126.16s)]
*  would protect against hackers, that kind of thing. And my mom would call up and be like, [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1132.48s)]
*  my browser disappeared. Where's my browser? [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1136.8799999999999s)]
*  My email is running slow. Elon, everything's going to junk. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1142.56s)]
*  Okay. But here, here is the most offensive, absurd take of all someone I've never heard of. You guys [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1148.0s)]
*  are in the biz. So you might have a Democrat representative of Texas. What's going on with [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  Texas? We got Jasmine Crockett. We got this loser, Jimmy Gomez, who had this take on it at a hearing [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1161.2s)]
*  with the CIA director and others. But this exchange is with CIA director, John Radcliffe. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1169.2s)]
*  Cliff, to your knowledge, do you know whether Pete Hegseth had been drinking [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1174.24s)]
*  before he leaked classified information? You're an idiot. I don't have any knowledge of [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1179.28s)]
*  secretary Hegseth's personal habits. Director Radcliffe. Same question. Yes or no. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1184.32s)]
*  No, I'm going to answer that. I think that's an offensive line of questioning. The answer is no. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1191.04s)]
*  I find it interesting that you want to... Hey, I yield back. This is my time. Director. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1196.0s)]
*  You asked me a question. Do you want an answer? No, listen. It's a yes or no. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1200.0s)]
*  You don't want to focus on the good work that the CIA is doing, that the intelligence community... [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1202.32s)]
*  Director, I reclaim my time. I have huge respect for the CIA, huge respect for [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1207.1200000000001s)]
*  men and women in uniform. But this was a question that's on the top of minds of every American. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1213.1200000000001s)]
*  Right? He stood in front of a podium and Europe holding a drink. So of course, we want to know if [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  his performance was compromised. Was his performance compromised because of a successful strike? [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1228.4799999999998s)]
*  I yield back. Mr. I bring my... You want to know... You want to talk about accepting responsibility? [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1234.7199999999998s)]

*  Americans safer? You want to focus on... I reclaim my time. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1243.52s)]
*  Unbelievable. By the way, apologies to Texas. He's of course actually from California. Can you [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1248.24s)]
*  believe the nerve of this guy? No. I can. I can. Democrats are in such bad shapes. Ashbrooke [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1254.4s)]
*  mentioned it earlier, but their right now favorability rating is the worst it's been in [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1262.48s)]
*  over a generation. President Trump's favorability rating is the highest it has ever been. It's [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1267.52s)]
*  higher than it was on election day. The Democrats are trying to manufacture anything. This is beyond [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1272.48s)]
*  grasping at straws. They see that they are falling into a pit and they're trying to grab [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1278.0s)]
*  anything they can. Anything that they think will let them get some kind of traction. Because since [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1282.8s)]
*  election day, they've been just getting steamrolled nonstop. Americans could not be more thrilled [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1287.76s)]
*  seeing criminals, illegals getting deported out of this country. The media doesn't want to talk [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1292.08s)]
*  about egg prices. Egg prices have halved in the past month. The story that they were trying to [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1297.1200000000001s)]
*  push that, oh my God, Biden killed all these chickens and now Trump's caused the egg prices [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1301.28s)]
*  to go up. Everything that they've tried to get Trump on has failed. This is going to go down in [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1304.8799999999999s)]
*  the same line. They're going to try to make a story out of this and I completely agree with you. The [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1309.92s)]
*  Trump administration should ignore this. Talk about the MS-13 guy you just arrested today and move on. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1313.84s)]
*  Keep putting up W's for the American people. This guy, Jimmy Gomez, according to a radio host in [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1318.48s)]
*  South Carolina, Brett Winterbull, was before he entered electoral politics, a labor organizer. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1327.28s)]
*  He was organizing labor. At the time, Pete Hegseth had a backpack on and a gun slung around his [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1334.8799999999999s)]
*  shoulder and was killing bad guys for us in Iraq and Afghanistan and down at Gitmo, dealing with [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1343.44s)]
*  the worst of the worst. So that's how Pete spent his formative adult years while Jimmy was a mini [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1348.24s)]
*  Barack Obama trying to organize, in his case, labor. But he wants to besmirch Pete as a drunk [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1354.48s)]
*  because he says, we saw him with a drink in his hand. What an absolute fucker. That is based on [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1362.4s)]
*  Pete standing up in front of a room full of people at a public event in which he was addressing, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1370.16s)]
*  I can't remember what the, what was the event you guys? Was this the NATO summit? Yes. Yeah, [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1375.68s)]
*  it was in Belgium. It might've been that I can't, anyway, look, he's saying this is him drinking [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1383.2s)]
*  booze. This idiot, Matt Iglesias said, I assume this is the trick of the light. And he's not [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1389.6000000000001s)]
*  actually throwing back bourbon on camera, but it's interesting that the water looks brown. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1395.6000000000001s)]
*  Meanwhile, it would've taken him 10 seconds to Google video from the event where it makes very [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1401.76s)]
*  clear the water was clear, like all water is, and that it was just a lighting trick. But now it [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1406.72s)]
*  winds up in a congressional hearing as like he's been, this is so disgusting how they use this stuff [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1412.72s)]
*  to absolutely smear honest, hardworking men. But it's also a perfect vignette into the larger [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1420.8s)]
*  problem that Democrats have when Smug was talking about their approval rating and what it is that [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1428.4s)]
*  they're talking about this knee jerk opposition to hugely popular things that president Trump is [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1432.56s)]
*  doing. Think about Jimmy's information flow, right? Think about the information that comes to him on [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1437.28s)]
*  a day-to-day basis to one conclude that that was in fact bourbon and two, that it's on the top of [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1444.8799999999999s)]
*  minds of everyone he's talking to. Think about the information that has to go into that man's head [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1451.6799999999998s)]
*  in order to conclude those two things in a congressional hearing and not feel [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1458.08s)]
*  entirely humiliated by the question in the first place. These people are wrecked. Their brain is [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1462.24s)]
*  just broken. It's so deeply offensive that you would get up there and actually suggest, and only [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1468.24s)]
*  in Congress can you get away with this because you've got a liability shield from defamation. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1475.04s)]
*  Actually basically call him a drunk. Say like, was he drunk when he was tweeting this shit? [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1479.4399999999998s)]
*  But if not for nothing, there's zero about the actual text that suggests in any way, [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1485.44s)]
*  shape or form that anyone was impaired while having this discussion. It's absolutely defamatory, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1490.72s)]
*  but they get away with it. To pick up on the point you just made, Smug, everyone's favorite pollster, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1497.52s)]
*  or at least poll analyst, Harry Enton was over on CNN doing a bit on what you just said on Trump's [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1503.68s)]
*  approval, and here's a bit of it. Isn't that favorable rating right now comes in at minus four [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1510.8s)]
*  points? Compare that to where he was when he won in November of 2024 when he was at minus seven [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1514.56s)]
*  points or March of 2017 when he was at minus 10 points. So when you compare Trump against himself, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1519.9199999999998s)]
*  he's actually closer to the apex than he is to the bottom of the trough. And of course, [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1526.32s)]
*  that's so important because Donald Trump historically speaking has had his numbers [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1530.72s)]
*  underestimated. So let's take a look at the percentage of the country who say that we're [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1535.04s)]
*  on the right track. It's actually a very high percentage when you compare it to some historical [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1539.12s)]
*  numbers. What are you talking about? According to Maris, 45% say that we're on the right track. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1542.9599999999998s)]
*  That's the second highest that Maris has measured since 2009. How about NBC News? 44%. That's the [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1546.7199999999998s)]
*  highest since 2004. The bottom line is the percentage of Americans who say we're on the [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1552.4799999999998s)]
*  right track is through the roof. His body movements are so great. They make the hits, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1557.52s)]
*  don't they? He's like, through the roof. And he's like, it's so high, it's down low. And [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1563.84s)]
*  it's out the window. He's very entertaining to watch. [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1569.76s)]
*  No, a little theater goes a long way. Particularly on CNN, it makes the rest of the stuff go down a [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1575.84s)]
*  little easier. Well, it really does. And he did that on a morning show on CNN. And so what I like [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1580.0s)]
*  to think about is what your typical CNN viewer did for the rest of the day after learning that [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1584.6399999999999s)]
*  information. Speaking of bourbon. Their day did not start off on the right foot when they found out [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1589.28s)]
*  that Donald Trump, the guy they hate so much, is actually very, very popular. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1593.76s)]
*  Yeah, they're not feeling about Harry the way the rest of us are. He's from the Bronx, which is [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1597.76s)]
*  another thing. I love the New York City accent. I love it. But Brooklyn, Bronx, it's utterly [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1601.68s)]
*  charming to me. Okay, enough of that. Signalgate will go away. No one will be fired and we'll be [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1607.28s)]
*  fine. However- We are fine. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1613.2s)]
*  I don't know if NPR is going to be okay. I think NPR is about to lose its taxpayer funding. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1616.56s)]
*  Based on what I saw yesterday. I think it's going to, based on what Trump tweeted [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1623.28s)]
*  and what we saw yesterday. It was so great to watch this woman, Catherine Maher. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1627.68s)]
*  Speaking of smug, smug, right? She was so smug. She was like oozing contempt and superiority [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1636.72s)]
*  and trying to be like, thank you so much for raising a thank you. Thanks for giving me the [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1646.8s)]
*  opportunity to respond to that. Now, let me lie for two minutes about how it never happened. [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1650.88s)]
*  I appreciate you giving me the chance to lie about how I never did the controversial thing. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1655.5200000000002s)]
*  I'm very grateful to you for bringing up. And then these congressmen just kept hitting her with, [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1658.8000000000002s)]
*  oh, you never did it? Oh, well, here's you saying you did it. And the best, I mean, there's so many [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1664.0800000000002s)]
*  good ones to choose from, but we might as well just kick it off with my new favorite congressman. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1668.5600000000002s)]
*  He is from Texas. He's Brandon Gill. He's married to Dinesh D'Souza's daughter. I didn't know any of [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1673.76s)]
*  this. He is a cold stone, stone cold assassin in that congressional seats. Watch him. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1681.52s)]
*  Do you believe that America is addicted to white supremacy? [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1691.36s)]
*  I believe that I tweeted that. And as I've said earlier, I believe much of my thinking has [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1695.44s)]
*  evolved over the last half decade. Do you believe that America believes in black plunder and white [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1700.0s)]
*  democracy? I don't believe that, sir. You tweeted that in reference to a book you were reading [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1704.8s)]
*  at the time, apparently the case for reparations. I don't think I've ever read that book, sir. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1712.0s)]
*  You tweeted about it. You said you took a day off to fully read the case for reparations. You put [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1717.12s)]
*  that on Twitter in January of 2020. I apologize. I don't recall that I did. Okay. No, I'd no doubt [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1723.44s)]
*  your tweet there is correct, but I don't recall that. Okay. Do you believe that white people [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1730.48s)]
*  inherently feel superior to other races? I do not. You tweeted something to that effect. You said, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1735.76s)]
*  I grew up feeling superior. How white of me. Why did you tweet that? I think I was probably [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1742.32s)]
*  reflecting on what it was to be, to grow up in an environment where I had lots of advantages. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1748.08s)]
*  It sounds like you're saying that white people feel superior. I don't believe that anybody [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1754.32s)]
*  feels that way, sir. I was just reflecting on my own experiences. Do you think the white people [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1759.28s)]
*  should pay reparations? I have never said that, sir. Yes, you did. You said it in January of 2020. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1763.12s)]
*  You tweeted, yes, the North, yes, all of us, yes, America, yes, our original collective sin and [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1769.52s)]
*  unpaid debt, yes, reparations, yes, on this day. I don't believe that was a reference to fiscal [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1775.28s)]
*  reparations, sir. What kind of reparations was it a reference to? I think it was just a reference [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1780.3999999999999s)]
*  to the idea that we all owe much to the people who came before us. Oh my God. I love him so much. I [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1784.96s)]
*  need to know him. He's got to come on this show. I have to tell him how much I deeply admire him. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1792.08s)]
*  He's an absolute rock star. So he was elected class president for the incoming freshmen and [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1797.68s)]
*  for good reason. It's because of that. He showed up and he wanted to be the tip of the spear. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1802.08s)]
*  He doesn't take any garbage. I mean, every time you see the left try to come up with some dirty [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1806.72s)]
*  trick to go after president Trump, to go after Republicans or like this, try to rob taxpayers [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1811.52s)]
*  like NPR has been doing pushing their fake hoaxes. He holds them accountable. That's what you want [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1815.52s)]
*  from a member of Congress. He's off to a phenomenal start and you love to see it. You want to see this [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1820.32s)]
*  is the people that we are sending to Congress. What I love most about it, Smug, is you can tell [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1824.72s)]
*  he's enjoying it. Oh, his big smile. He's getting a crack in the smile as he's going back. He's like, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1829.2s)]
*  oh, I got a receipt for that one too. You know, that's what the cadence of it is fantastic. He's [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1833.84s)]
*  like, oh, but do you have, there's a, there's a tweet about it. Yes, you did. Yes, you did. His, [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1838.48s)]
*  his lack of emotionality is what made it so good. He was just like, you did. You said that you did [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1846.08s)]
*  tweet that here's the exact tweet you did. You said you read that book. You said you took the [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1853.2s)]
*  whole day off and spent the day reading that book. And here's the thing that's so great about it is, [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1858.48s)]
*  you know, so which, which is the lie? Were you lying when you said that you read these [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1863.92s)]
*  woke, annoying books time and time again to try to pander to left wingers who you think are your [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1869.04s)]
*  fans? Was that a lie? Or are you lying today under oath when you're looking at me saying you never [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1876.3200000000002s)]
*  read these books? Because like, not only did you take the time to lie to all these people, if you [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1882.48s)]
*  didn't read these books, but like you actually tweeted it in front of, I don't know how many [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1887.1200000000001s)]
*  followers followers she has probably hundreds of thousands. So like the virtue signaling that she [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1891.52s)]
*  felt was important to do to be like, I'm a leftist, just like all of you. And I'm reading all your [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1897.28s)]
*  favorite insane books, like, which is worse if those were lies and she was just pandering or if [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1902.4s)]
*  she really did that shit and then just lied under oath to Congress. [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1909.76s)]
*  I think it's pretty clear that she lied under oath to Congress. I mean, look at the organization [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1914.16s)]
*  that she's running. I mean, this is not somebody who's faking leftism. You had a deep commitment [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1917.68s)]
*  to it over a period of time that like, I don't know if you just flip on the radio, turn on, [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1922.24s)]
*  I mean, that's what it is, folks. That's what it is. There's no secrets there. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1926.88s)]
*  Remember the Ted talk she gave? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1930.3200000000002s)]
*  Do we think she read the case for reparations? I don't think she read the case for reparations. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1931.04s)]
*  Go ahead, Ashbrook. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1934.48s)]
*  Remember the Ted talk she gave where she was trying to explain why truth doesn't matter, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1936.16s)]
*  why leftist ideals are more important than truth? [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1941.44s)]
*  Oh, God. Yeah, that like objectivity gets in the way. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1944.48s)]
*  White men are. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1948.0s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1949.28s)]
*  Yeah. What I loved most about that exchange is like we all had this buddy in college who would [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1950.64s)]
*  black out so much and then the next day you'd have to walk him through his evening. [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1954.96s)]
*  And he'd be like, oh no. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1961.28s)]
*  That doesn't sound like me at all. I'd never do that. [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1963.44s)]
*  The end of it is like, all right, who do I need to do apologies? [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1967.52s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1969.84s)]
*  Thank God that guy was never subjected to my new favorite representative. [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1974.6399999999999s)]
*  Although it probably went down exactly like that with his buddies. [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1979.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1982.3999999999999s)]
*  It was like, yes, he did. [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1982.56s)]
*  They used a picture of it. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1983.76s)]
*  You tweeted about it. [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1985.76s)]
*  I didn't know you were standing on the bar. [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1986.72s)]
*  Yeah, you did. Here's more. First of all, I'll go back to the congressional hearing, [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1991.6s)]
*  but I will give you a little bit for old time's sake of Catherine Mars, [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1995.04s)]
*  Ted talk that you referenced in 2022. This is before she became the head of MPR. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=1999.52s)]
*  This is the stuff that got her the job. Watch. [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2005.76s)]
*  That perhaps for our most tricky disagreements, seeking the truth and [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2009.6s)]
*  seeking to convince others of the truth might not be the right place to start. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2015.84s)]
*  In fact, our reference for the truth might be a distraction that's getting in the way [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2022.08s)]
*  of finding common ground and getting things done is because the truth of the matter is very often [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2029.52s)]
*  for many people what happens when we merge facts about the world with our beliefs about the world. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2036.56s)]
*  So we all have different truths. [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2043.4399999999998s)]
*  What? [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2046.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2046.6599999999999s)]
*  Yikes. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2047.1599999999999s)]
*  This is not extemporanea. She practiced that speech 37,000 times in front of the mirror [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2047.8200000000002s)]
*  so she could deliver it with that cadence and the in fact folks with that hushed tone. [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2054.86s)]
*  It's like the worst HR person in corporate America showed up in your office and they're [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2061.98s)]
*  telling you why you have to shut your computer down. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2067.1s)]
*  I mean, she's like, she's the embodiment of the problem. [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2070.46s)]
*  Seminars. Go ahead, Smug. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2073.1800000000003s)]
*  She's the embodiment of the whole problem the left has now found itself in. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2075.34s)]
*  They've been completely siloed off from the majority of people. [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2079.02s)]
*  The way she talks, she's doing a Ted Talk with such self-importance and explaining to people, [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2082.86s)]
*  here's the thing, there's lots of truths. [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2088.86s)]
*  You know, I run NPR, it's not important for me to give objective facts. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2091.58s)]
*  We're talking about, we need to get across the message that we want people to believe. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2095.74s)]
*  Public radio. [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2100.46s)]
*  I'm not surprised at all that she has no memory of tweeting any of those things because people [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2102.3799999999997s)]
*  like this, life is theater for these people and they're just acting. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2106.7799999999997s)]
*  When you're an actor, sometimes you forget your lines. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2112.2999999999997s)]
*  Here's some more from Catherine Mayer over the years. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2115.66s)]
*  Again, this is just over the past few years. [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2118.62s)]
*  Again, before she was made CEO, but I would suggest to you, [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2121.02s)]
*  this is why they made her CEO in January of 2024. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2124.7s)]
*  Okay, on looting. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2128.94s)]
*  I mean, sure, looting is counterproductive, but it's hard to be mad about protests not [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2131.9s)]
*  prioritizing the private property of a system of oppression founded on treating people's [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2135.9s)]
*  ancestors as private property. [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2142.14s)]
*  On whiteness. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2144.46s)]
*  I know that hysteric white woman voice. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2145.9s)]
*  I was taught to do it. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2149.5s)]
*  I've done it. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2151.18s)]
*  It's a disturbing recognition. [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2152.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, I don't recall ever using it to deliberately expose another person to [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2154.46s)]
*  immediate physical harm on my own cognizance. [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2158.3s)]
*  It's not impossible. [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2161.7400000000002s)]
*  That is whiteness. [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2163.26s)]
*  She's got a rant about too many white men in business class and in the lounge. [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2165.98s)]
*  She's annoyed with seeing all the white people like herself and the guys, [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2171.1800000000003s)]
*  especially with the penises. [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2174.7000000000003s)]
*  She gets upset. [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2176.2200000000003s)]
*  I mean, there's you name it. [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2177.6600000000003s)]
*  There's a tweet for it. [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2179.34s)]
*  Catherine Mayer absolutely hates white people. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2180.3s)]
*  But realistically, she doesn't. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2183.1s)]
*  I think she's just faking. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2185.58s)]
*  She's been faking for a long time, like all these other Upper West Side women who are [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2187.02s)]
*  the wokeness that you can be and who are being reflected in these polls as the only [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2191.5s)]
*  thing still propping up the Democratic Party. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2197.1s)]
*  Right? [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2199.2599999999998s)]
*  It's these woke white women like Catherine Maher. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2199.5s)]
*  Meanwhile, black people are like, would you stop that shit for the love of God? [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2203.66s)]
*  I have a fantastic idea for her. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2210.2999999999997s)]
*  Since she's so concerned about reparations and everything and BLM. [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2213.18s)]
*  We're tearing up BLM Plaza here in Washington, D.C. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2216.54s)]
*  16th Street is going to be restored to its former glory. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2219.26s)]
*  But NPR has some fantastic real estate here in our nation's capital, [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2222.78s)]
*  a beautiful building in the heart of the city. [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2226.7000000000003s)]
*  I think we take off the words NPR and we put BLM. [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2228.7000000000003s)]
*  And we can just have everybody go there too. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2232.7000000000003s)]
*  I mean, we can just make it like basically housing for everybody. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2234.7000000000003s)]
*  That'd be a great service to the community. [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2241.02s)]
*  Maybe she'd be interested in that. [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2243.1800000000003s)]
*  I was sort of with her though. [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2244.7000000000003s)]
*  When you were talking, Megan, you were talking about the people that she cloisters herself [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2246.7000000000003s)]
*  around and the white women, the wine mom essentially. [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2250.6200000000003s)]
*  She was like, oh, I know that voice. [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2254.5400000000004s)]
*  I was kind of with her on that. [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2256.78s)]
*  That's pretty much it. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2260.94s)]
*  That's exactly what annoys all of us. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2261.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2264.86s)]
*  But I mean, it's like, I've been that voice. [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2265.5800000000004s)]
*  Okay. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2267.5800000000004s)]
*  What do you mean? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2268.3s)]
*  What specifically did you do? [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2268.94s)]
*  I want to know exactly. [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2270.3s)]
*  Get into more. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2271.1800000000003s)]
*  That would have been a good follow-up. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2271.98s)]
*  Like what exactly you said you did this. [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2273.34s)]
*  Could you walk us through how and when you use the white woman voice and said all the [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2275.34s)]
*  things that you were taught? [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2281.18s)]
*  Who taught you that it's a disturbing recognition? [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2282.94s)]
*  And you're suggesting you did use it to deliberately expose another person to immediate physical harm. [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2286.22s)]
*  You might've done that. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2292.22s)]
*  Who? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2293.1s)]
*  Who got hurt? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2293.66s)]
*  Why'd you do that? [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2294.54s)]
*  That is fucking racist. [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2295.42s)]
*  That's actually really upsetting. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2296.62s)]
*  Like you should not be the head of NPR or any other news organization. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2298.78s)]
*  I remember one time she used that voice and said, you're fired to a guy named Uri Berliner, [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2302.14s)]
*  who had the temerity to say, maybe at NPR we should have another Republican or two. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2306.86s)]
*  Maybe it shouldn't be 1000 libs and Democrats. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2311.82s)]
*  Deep track. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2316.94s)]
*  Good hit. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2317.66s)]
*  That's all. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2318.22s)]
*  Here's a little bit more. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2318.78s)]
*  Let's go to representative Tim Burchett. [[00:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2319.66s)]
*  This was one of the best. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2321.82s)]
*  Side eight. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2323.02s)]
*  Why did you call president Trump a fascist and a deranged racist sociopath in 2020? [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2325.1s)]
*  Congressman, I appreciate the opportunity to address this. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2331.3399999999997s)]
*  I regret those tweets. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2333.98s)]
*  I would not tweet them again today. [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2335.18s)]
*  They represented a time where I was reflecting on something that I believe that the president [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2337.18s)]
*  had said rather than who he is. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2341.8199999999997s)]
*  I don't presume that anyone is a racist. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2343.66s)]
*  You don't believe anyone is a racist. [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2346.62s)]
*  I don't start by presuming anyone is a racist, sir. [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2348.2999999999997s)]
*  But thank you so much for asking me because I love that. [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2352.2999999999997s)]
*  Why did you call him a racist, fascist sociopath? [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2355.18s)]
*  I regret that. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2359.5s)]
*  I regret that. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2362.7000000000003s)]
*  Volsha, she doesn't regret that at all. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2363.5s)]
*  She totally stands by every word of that. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2365.7400000000002s)]
*  Thank you so much for the opportunity to address all these past comments. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2369.1s)]
*  I can't thank you enough. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2373.42s)]
*  I think the most important thing for everyone to take away from all this is you're paying her. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2375.82s)]
*  Your money is going to her against your will. [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2381.66s)]
*  And that has to stop. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2386.7000000000003s)]
*  It has to stop immediately. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2387.82s)]
*  This hearing was so important because everyone should have to see. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2389.34s)]
*  This is what Doge is doing. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2394.06s)]
*  They're getting vilified. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2395.42s)]
*  They're getting attacked, terrorized across the country [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2396.38s)]
*  because they're bringing garbage like this to light. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2399.26s)]
*  There's no reason hardworking people who go to work day in, day out are paying that woman's salary. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2402.6200000000003s)]
*  That's completely unfair. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2408.38s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2409.42s)]
*  Yeah, it's supposed to be public information. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2410.1400000000003s)]
*  It's there to try to get people educated on what's going on in their government, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2411.9s)]
*  in their communities, and everything else. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2415.1800000000003s)]
*  In reality, what it is, is a poison that's going into communities. [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2417.02s)]
*  When you have viewpoints like this, it's not a surprise that the derivation of that is DEI [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2421.5s)]
*  that goes on above all the education system problems that we've seen pop up over the last few years. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2426.54s)]
*  I mean, what they're doing is quite literally tearing communities apart. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2431.98s)]
*  100%. [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2436.14s)]
*  Well, so here's the thing. [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2437.66s)]
*  She later tried to claim, oh, there's a strong firewall between me and the news division. [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2439.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't run editorial on the head of NPR, but trust me. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2445.42s)]
*  I'm just the CEO. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2448.1400000000003s)]
*  But even so, whatever, the whole organization is full of rot. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2449.98s)]
*  It's up and down to the studs. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2455.5s)]
*  It's full of rot and hatred for Republicans and an aversion to the truth if that truth [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2458.46s)]
*  reflects negatively on Democrats or positively on Republicans. [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2465.1000000000004s)]
*  And that's where the real problem is with NPR. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2468.86s)]
*  It's not so much, I mean, she's fun to make fun of. [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2470.78s)]
*  But the real problem is that this really is media matters with a different moniker. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2473.18s)]
*  That's how far left they are. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2479.34s)]
*  And getting to how biased they are in their coverage, which again, we're paying for, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2481.2599999999998s)]
*  is really getting to the heart of the matter. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2487.1s)]
*  That's what Jim Jordan tried to do in the following exchange, Sat.12. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2488.62s)]
*  He wrote on the Trump Russia story, he wrote, [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2493.5s)]
*  At NPR, we hitched our wagon to Trump's most visible antagonist, [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2497.42s)]
*  Representative Adam Schiff. [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2502.38s)]
*  He said they interviewed him 25 times. [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2503.9s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2505.5s)]
*  I was not there at the time, but those numbers sound accurate. [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2506.7000000000003s)]
*  Those sound accurate. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2509.1800000000003s)]
*  But then he said when the Mueller report came out, he said, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2510.54s)]
*  Russiagate faded from our programming. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2513.34s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2515.9s)]
*  Again, I was not there at the time. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2516.86s)]
*  I'm not, I couldn't say. [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2518.06s)]
*  You couldn't say? [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2519.82s)]
*  I was not at NPR at the time. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2520.7000000000003s)]
*  You didn't prepare for that? [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2522.1400000000003s)]
*  You knew we were going to ask you about this guy, didn't you? [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2523.02s)]
*  It's come up like 6,000 times already in the hearing. [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2524.86s)]
*  I just couldn't say whether it faded from our coverage, sir. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2527.58s)]
*  How about this story? [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2530.78s)]
*  October 2020, New York Post had the Hunter Biden laptop story. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2531.9s)]
*  And one of those editors, I guess one of those 87 Democrat editors, [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2535.98s)]
*  said this, we don't want to waste our time on stories that are not really stories. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2541.58s)]
*  We don't want to waste the listeners and readers' times on stories [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2545.5s)]
*  that are just pure distractions. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2548.6200000000003s)]
*  Was that a pure distraction story? [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2550.1400000000003s)]
*  Our current editorial leadership believes that that was a mistake, as do I. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2552.22s)]
*  Yeah, the whole country knows that was a mistake. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2556.2999999999997s)]
*  Mr. Berliner said we became fervent members of the team Natural Origin, [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2558.62s)]
*  even declaring that the lab leak was debunked by scientists. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2562.9399999999996s)]
*  Is there a question there? [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2565.8199999999997s)]
*  There is. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2566.7s)]
*  You guys were 0 for 3. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2567.5s)]
*  On the three of the biggest stories in the last five years, you guys were 0 for 3. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2568.7799999999997s)]
*  And yet you maintain that NPR is not biased? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2573.74s)]
*  Congressman, I do not believe we are politically biased. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2577.8199999999997s)]
*  No, we are a nonpartisan organization. [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2580.2999999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2582.54s)]
*  Russiagate, Hunter laptop, and COVID. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2584.46s)]
*  I mean, he exposed her. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2588.2200000000003s)]
*  And he's exactly right. [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2590.2200000000003s)]
*  The mistakes only go in one direction. [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2591.1800000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2593.98s)]
*  Well, I'm also reminded that none of this would be happening if not for a two-seat [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2594.7000000000003s)]
*  majority in the House of Representatives. [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2600.3s)]
*  None of those questions would be asked in the first place. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2601.9s)]
*  She would have no regrets about any of that at all. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2603.98s)]
*  I mean, it's one of the things that we tell our listeners, [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2606.78s)]
*  and I know you tell your viewers and listeners as well, is you can't sort of relax and hope [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2609.26s)]
*  that everything is going to work out all right. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2614.7000000000003s)]
*  Because but for two seats in the House of Representatives across this country, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2616.78s)]
*  none of those questions would even be asked, much less contemplated by a woman who's clearly [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2622.46s)]
*  got an agenda to run national public airwaves as she sees fit and as she sees fit is off the [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2626.38s)]
*  left-hand side of the map. [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2633.0200000000004s)]
*  So true. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2635.5s)]
*  They did a great job yesterday of exposing just how left they are. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2636.7799999999997s)]
*  And they reference back to that Uri Berliner piece in the Free Press. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2640.14s)]
*  He won a Peabody. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2645.02s)]
*  He was there for 25 years. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2645.8199999999997s)]
*  Very respected journalist who comes out to say, we've lost our way. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2646.94s)]
*  I mean, we're hard left now. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2649.98s)]
*  We don't care about truth. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2651.66s)]
*  What we care about is protecting Dems and promoting them. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2653.02s)]
*  And this came up because somebody was asking her, I think it was Jordan again, yeah, [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2656.94s)]
*  about what Uri posited in that piece, which was of the editors in the DC area alone. [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2661.58s)]
*  That's just the only one I checked. [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2668.86s)]
*  We found 87 Dems and zero Republicans. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2671.66s)]
*  And she actually had the nerve to try to say that that was concerning to her. [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2676.38s)]
*  I think this is that. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2681.1s)]
*  Let's just watch a little bit of it. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2682.22s)]
*  Sat 11. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2683.42s)]
*  Is NPR biased? [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2685.66s)]
*  Congressman, I have never seen any instance of- [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2688.22s)]
*  Never? [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2690.46s)]
*  Political bias determining editorial decisions. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2691.74s)]
*  No. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2693.98s)]
*  Well, Mr. Berliner in his story last year wrote, in the DC area, editorial positions at NPR, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2695.02s)]
*  he said he found 87 registered Democrats, zero Republicans. [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2707.5s)]
*  Is that accurate? [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2712.3799999999997s)]
*  We do not track the numbers or the voter registration, but I find that- [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2713.74s)]
*  Was award-winning journalist who worked 25 years at NPR, Mr. Berliner, was he lying [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2717.18s)]
*  when he wrote that? [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2722.06s)]
*  I am not presuming such. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2723.1s)]
*  We don't track that information about our journalists. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2726.46s)]
*  87 to zero, and you're not biased? [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2728.22s)]
*  I think that is concerning if those numbers are accurate. [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2730.94s)]
*  Then do something about it. [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2735.4199999999996s)]
*  It's more dishonest. [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2737.5s)]
*  She doesn't find that concerning. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2740.14s)]
*  It's been a year since Berliner's piece. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2741.74s)]
*  And if she cared at all, they already would have been hired. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2743.9s)]
*  They hired some six-person editorial board to shore up their editorial over there, [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2748.38s)]
*  not one of whom is a Republican. [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2754.38s)]
*  There is no way forward in cutting out the majority of the country. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2757.1s)]
*  Now, the majority is right-leaning and voted for Trump out of the conversation entirely. [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2762.3s)]
*  And if you want to be that left-wing rag, right on, sister, you do you. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2767.82s)]
*  That's why we have MSNBC and a lot of other organizations. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2771.58s)]
*  But we don't have to pay for it. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2774.54s)]
*  Bingo. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2777.18s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2777.74s)]
*  That's totally right. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2778.94s)]
*  Johnny, you bring this up all the time, but they've had ample opportunity to rectify [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2780.14s)]
*  what was exposed by Berliner. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2785.1s)]
*  Right. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2787.9s)]
*  And we all know what happened. [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2788.46s)]
*  Do you heard what she said? [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2792.3s)]
*  She says, I was not there at the time that this was taking place. [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2793.34s)]
*  But when she started, the first thing she did right after she got her login and her [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2797.18s)]
*  password was to get rid of Uri Berliner because he had the temerity to say that maybe we [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2802.22s)]
*  shouldn't be so biased at this place. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2807.9s)]
*  And so her dishonesty is multilevel in this whole interaction. [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2810.2999999999997s)]
*  And I really hope so many people saw this because they can see NPR for what it is. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2816.06s)]
*  And finally, we cannot have to pay for it. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2821.2599999999998s)]
*  It is wild that you could be the CEO, [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2823.8199999999997s)]
*  ostensibly the CEO of a company or organization, and have little to no idea of what goes on [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2825.98s)]
*  there. [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2831.1s)]
*  You admit that in a public hearing. [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2832.62s)]
*  It's like she doesn't know anything about the BLM tweets. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2834.62s)]
*  She doesn't know anything that's happening in NPR. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2837.02s)]
*  The only thing she's 100% sure of is that she's tweeted that Donald Trump is racist. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2838.62s)]
*  Right. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2842.78s)]
*  And she's very glad that you brought that up. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2843.26s)]
*  Very glad. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2845.1s)]
*  Very glad. [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2845.58s)]
*  So she can tell you it isn't true. [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2846.06s)]
*  I don't know why I said that. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2847.66s)]
*  I was that was crazy talk. [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2849.1s)]
*  The funny thing is there was a report, I think it was Politico, after the hearing yesterday [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2850.7s)]
*  saying that, no, it was New York Times, Benjamin Mullen, who reported that supporters of public [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2855.02s)]
*  media were breathing a sigh of relief at the end of the hearing. [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2861.9s)]
*  One long time public media executive texted me to say that neither chief executive, [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2866.7s)]
*  because PBS was also there, had made a major error yet. [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2870.86s)]
*  They don't get it, you guys. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2875.02s)]
*  No, they're living in a bubble with viewers like you and the members of the Paul R. and [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2877.74s)]
*  John D. MacArthur Foundation. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2882.38s)]

*  They're like, Catherine, stellar, right on point. [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2890.22s)]
*  That part where you said you didn't actually read the books, loved that part. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2894.38s)]
*  Didn't lay a glove on you. [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2900.7s)]
*  Game check to sponsor. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2903.02s)]
*  Your funding go away. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2905.1s)]
*  I mean, probably to be honest, the most important question there was that question we played of [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2906.3s)]
*  the guy being like, why did you call Donald Trump a fascist, racist sociopath? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2911.34s)]
*  I meant it lovingly. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2916.6200000000003s)]
*  That was probably the most important one because Trump already tweeting out, [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2917.9s)]
*  we need to defund these guys. [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2922.46s)]
*  They've got to go. [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2924.2200000000003s)]
*  There's no point in us funding PBS. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2925.1800000000003s)]
*  And all the Dems had was, but Elmo, but Elmo. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2927.42s)]
*  Meanwhile, Sesame Street was sold to HBO in 2015. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2930.46s)]
*  Right. [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2934.46s)]
*  Elmo is going to be just fine. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2935.34s)]
*  He's in the private sector now. [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2937.6600000000003s)]
*  He's doing great. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2938.7000000000003s)]
*  All right. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2941.98s)]
*  We're going to take a quick break. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2943.6600000000003s)]
*  We'll be right back. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2944.7000000000003s)]
*  The fellows are with me for the full show and there's a lot more to get to. [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2945.5s)]
*  Stand by. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2949.5s)]
*  As president Trump is settling into his new administration, one of the top Democrats in [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2952.7000000000003s)]
*  Congress aiming to undermine the Trump agenda is Democrat Senator Dick Durbin of Illinois. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2956.6200000000003s)]
*  And according to our sponsor, the electronic payments coalition, [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2962.06s)]
*  Senator Durbin has a new plan, a government takeover of your credit card. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2965.7400000000002s)]
*  Today, Americans have thousands of choices in credit cards, but they say [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2970.46s)]
*  Senator Durbin's plan will result in less competition and less security, [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2974.46s)]
*  which means more risk for your credit and your identity. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2978.2200000000003s)]
*  You can learn more for yourself at guardyourcard.org. [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2981.98s)]
*  And you could consider telling your senators to stop Dick Durbin's government takeover of [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2986.38s)]
*  your credit card before it's too late. [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2990.86s)]
*  Guys, there's been a lot of this in the news lately. [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2994.54s)]
*  And so I just, I decided to save this segment for you. [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2997.34s)]
*  And I know we're going to get to hack madness, your own special version of March Madness in a [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=2999.66s)]
*  minute, but to put us in the mood, this is the appetizer to hack madness. [[00:50:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3003.5s)]
*  I have my own little game for you. [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3008.2999999999997s)]
*  And this is more in the field of the Academy Awards. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3010.06s)]
*  And I really would love for you guys to weigh in on who you think, who you think is, in fact, [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3014.2999999999997s)]
*  the best actress in America today, outside of Hollywood. [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3021.42s)]
*  And I have got a couple of contenders for you. [[00:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3027.5s)]
*  All right. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3030.38s)]
*  I've narrowed it down to four. [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3030.86s)]
*  And I'm going to show you how these people normally sound and then how they sound when [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3033.6600000000003s)]
*  they get in front of certain audiences and certain cameras. [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3039.5s)]
*  And you're going to tell me who you think, who wore it best, who fooled you, who's really [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3042.6200000000003s)]
*  like, who's phoning it in and who's really going method. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3048.86s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3052.3s)]
*  Okay. [[00:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3052.96s)]
*  In fourth place, not necessarily fourth place. [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3054.1600000000003s)]
*  This is just, I'm going to start with as the fourth possibility, but I've got four total [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3056.88s)]
*  and you'll decide what order they go in. [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3060.96s)]
*  I'm going to kick it off with AOC. [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3063.2000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3066.88s)]
*  Her real name is Sandy Ocasio. [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3067.52s)]
*  This is what she went by her entire life, Sandy Ocasio. [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3070.7200000000003s)]
*  And only when she decided to run for office, did she decide to suddenly become Alexandria [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3074.7200000000003s)]
*  Ocasio-Cortez and lean into her Puerto Rican history where her mother was born in Puerto Rico, [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3079.92s)]
*  but her father was born in New York City. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3087.2000000000003s)]
*  And she decided to tell us sob stories about how she's from a poor family and she was living, [[00:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3090.8s)]
*  you know, paycheck to paycheck. [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3096.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, she was raised in a Tony part of Westchester called Yorktown Heights. [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3098.08s)]
*  The single family home she grew up in was just sold in 2016 for $355,000. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3103.76s)]
*  So it's not exactly, you know, food stamp central. [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3107.76s)]
*  She went to Boston University. [[00:51:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3113.92s)]
*  You know, to hear her tell her story, you'd think she never went to college, right? [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3116.32s)]
*  She was only a bartender. [[00:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3119.2000000000003s)]
*  No, she went to Boston University and graduated with a BA in International Relations and Economics [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3120.7200000000003s)]
*  and then spent some time as a waitress and a bartender. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3128.1600000000003s)]
*  Good for you. [[00:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3132.8s)]
*  Virtually everyone in America did too. [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3134.0s)]
*  Like who didn't? [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3136.0s)]
*  I mean, literally raise your hand if you had a service personnel job. [[00:52:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3136.64s)]
*  Oh my God, yes. [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3140.72s)]
*  Right. All of us, all five of us. [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3142.16s)]
*  Hello. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3143.6s)]
*  The difference is we don't run around asking for people to pat us on the back because we did it. [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3144.08s)]
*  It's called being a normal human. [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3148.4s)]
*  When you're young, you take those kinds of jobs. [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3150.3199999999997s)]
*  And even when you're older, sometimes you do to pay your bills. [[00:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3153.04s)]
*  This is called being a normal human, not, oh, what was me? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3156.0s)]
*  I worked as a waitress. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3160.16s)]
*  And I'll get to some of what she's saying around that. [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3161.3599999999997s)]
*  But that's her story. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3163.44s)]
*  Now she makes almost $200,000 a year as a US Congresswoman [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3165.2s)]
*  and is still pretending that she's on her waitress salary. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3169.36s)]
*  But in any event, here is how she normally sounds when she's speaking and not thinking [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3171.84s)]
*  about who's listening or trying to fool anybody. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3179.36s)]
*  When Donald Trump tapped into this idea of make America great again, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3183.68s)]
*  there was times of economic opportunity. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3188.56s)]

*  They should have taught her at Boston University. [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3198.16s)]
*  It was were. There were times. [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3200.4s)]
*  She was right. You got to get that subject verb agreement. [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3201.76s)]
*  I know it's tough, Sandy. [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3204.16s)]
*  Work on it. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3205.28s)]
*  That's her, though, sounding relatively normal. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3206.88s)]
*  Then there's a different version that we've heard a lot more of a lot recently. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3210.48s)]
*  I'm proud to be a bartender. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3214.96s)]
*  Ain't nothing wrong with that. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3218.96s)]
*  Ain't nothing wrong with working retail, folding clothes for other people to buy. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3221.68s)]
*  We know. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3227.92s)]
*  I'm tired of hearing about how a two-bit union buster thinks of himself as more of a patriot [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3228.32s)]
*  than the woman who fights every single day to lift working people out [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3235.76s)]
*  so much as a boost of greed traveling on our way of life. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3242.24s)]
*  Our way of life. [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3248.3999999999996s)]
*  All right. So you got you got that in mind? [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3250.24s)]
*  Are we you're with me? [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3253.4399999999996s)]
*  It'd be tough to beat. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3254.24s)]
*  It is. But we have contenders. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3255.68s)]
*  All right. Now I'm going to go outside of the political realm for this next one. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3258.24s)]
*  You'll know her as soon as you see her. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3262.7999999999997s)]
*  I think let's play the normal version of the person who whose name is [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3264.64s)]
*  Hillary, who grew up in a very nice suburb of Boston going to some Tony rich school [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3271.44s)]
*  that virtually no one else can afford. [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3278.16s)]
*  I think her dad is a dentist, but now goes by [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3279.92s)]
*  Baldwin. Here she is sounding like her normal self. [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3284.88s)]
*  It's not easy. And I think part of it is that I'm in shape before I have a baby. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3289.28s)]
*  And then I stay active when I'm pregnant. [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3292.8s)]
*  And I'm not trying to stay thin. [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3295.44s)]
*  I'm just trying to keep my circulation going and stretching and keep my muscle tone up. [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3297.44s)]
*  And then married life is really nice. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3303.6s)]
*  You know that. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3308.7200000000003s)]
*  So please leave my family in peace and let this all play out. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3310.08s)]
*  We have cucumbers, olive oil, and we have some vinegar. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3315.52s)]
*  We have so much. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3323.76s)]
*  That's so funny. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3329.0400000000004s)]
*  She sounds like Penelope Cruz. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3330.7200000000003s)]
*  I'm making it tough for you. [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3334.6400000000003s)]
*  You say cucumber? [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3335.6000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, you're such a fucking hypercletus. [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3336.4s)]
*  That's the vinegar. [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3342.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay. So already I'm torn. I like, I got to say, just to be honest, I'm not sure who I like better [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3344.2400000000002s)]
*  on best actress, but we've got other contenders. So, you know, keep an open mind. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3350.7999999999997s)]
*  This woman all over the news these days, the new spokesperson for the Democrat party, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3356.64s)]
*  and we all hope the future of it. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3360.56s)]
*  Here's Jasmine Crockett as recently as 2023. [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3363.2s)]
*  Again, sounding like a normal person. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3367.12s)]
*  In my mind, I'm thinking, I just got to Austin and I had to meet five people to get here. [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3370.16s)]
*  It's a huge responsibility. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3375.7599999999998s)]
*  You know, the congressional seat is over four times as large as my house seat. [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3377.44s)]
*  Kind of cute, excited, optimistic, normal hair, normal eyelashes, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3383.84s)]
*  and probably normal nails, though they weren't shown in that clip. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3391.28s)]
*  Flash forward to today's day and age and more recently, and we've done a 180. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3394.7200000000003s)]

*  Fuck off. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3404.4s)]
*  Now, I am tired of the white tears. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3405.04s)]
*  There has been no oppression for the white man in this country. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3407.12s)]
*  It is white men on this side of the aisle telling us, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3410.96s)]
*  people of color on this side of the aisle, that y'all are the ones being oppressed. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3414.48s)]
*  If you could tell Donald Trump anything tonight, what would you tell him? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3419.84s)]
*  Stop being Putin's hoe. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3426.56s)]
*  Unfortunately, we had an opportunity to have a woman lead this country, [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3428.16s)]
*  and I promise you, she would have led us to the promised land. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3432.0s)]

*  We have someone that is occupying the White House, and as far as I'm concerned, [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3439.28s)]
*  he is an enemy to the United States. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3443.52s)]

*  As I will, she sounds absolutely nothing like she used to, you guys. [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3461.92s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3468.2400000000002s)]

*  Note how she said courage and hear where we had ours being used properly. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3523.84s)]
*  And yet when she ran for president, having been past the baton by Joe Biden, [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3530.88s)]
*  very, very different sounding. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3537.76s)]

*  It's like, no, I don't understand the English language. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3663.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm going to pretend that I don't know what a cucumber is. [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3665.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3669.12s)]
*  You said you love Jasmine Crockett. [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3669.2799999999997s)]
*  I love Ilaria. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3671.3599999999997s)]
*  I love her so much. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3672.8799999999997s)]
*  I love that she tries to sound like Penelope Cruz. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3673.8399999999997s)]
*  It makes me want to buy a Cessna and start running drugs. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3675.7599999999998s)]
*  Wait, we're going to come back to Ilaria in one second. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3678.48s)]
*  But I mean, I feel like you might be giving short shrift to Jasmine, right? [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3685.28s)]
*  Who's like, that the 2023 version is so sweet. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3689.44s)]
*  You like her. [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3692.96s)]
*  You're like, oh, yeah, I see why Houstonians said, yeah, let's send this gal to Congress before she was like, bitch, I will cut you. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3693.6s)]
*  Whoa, wait, what? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3702.2400000000002s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3704.2400000000002s)]
*  What happened? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3704.88s)]
*  I think among those selections that you gave us, number one, it overlooks lifetime achievement, Hillary Clinton, who famously when she goes in the South, all of a sudden is a Southerner. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3706.4s)]
*  Lifetime achievement. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3716.2400000000002s)]
*  But in those choices, three of those people are doing it out of political expediency. [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3717.04s)]
*  They're just your standard run the mill political crook, extra pander. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3724.64s)]
*  Points for that, right? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3727.84s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3728.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, I take waypoints. [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3729.2000000000003s)]
*  That's commonplace. [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3730.48s)]
*  In DC, it's a dime a dozen finding someone who's going to lie and just play to the audience to get what they want out of them. [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3731.28s)]
*  Hilaria Baldwin is just crazy. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3736.56s)]
*  She's doing it for the love of the game. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3738.64s)]
*  Exactly. [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3739.84s)]
*  He's the love of the game. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3740.2400000000002s)]
*  It's so pure. [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3741.76s)]
*  It comes from a pure place of like, I want to be crazy. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3742.88s)]
*  I'm going to be totally nuts. [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3746.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3748.4s)]
*  He totally buys in, right? [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3749.52s)]
*  Like he goes on the late night shows. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3750.88s)]
*  He's like, you know, my wife, she's from Spain. [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3752.1600000000003s)]
*  She's my she. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3754.08s)]
*  She's a good girl. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3754.88s)]
*  Literally, she grew up in Boston. [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3757.6800000000003s)]
*  Wait, she's definitely not from Spain. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3758.88s)]
*  What? [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3763.76s)]
*  What are you saying? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3764.56s)]
*  Two Bostonians in this, by the way, which is an interesting maybe there's a regional issue there. [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3767.36s)]
*  Boston University has just got a reputation putting out horrible people. [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3772.88s)]
*  Who's the other Bostonian? [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3776.08s)]
*  I think this is a known thing. [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3777.28s)]
*  Like a lot of people from Boston University just problems. [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3778.7200000000003s)]
*  Problems, problems, problems. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3781.12s)]
*  It's a known thing. [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3782.4s)]
*  You're going to hate me for that. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3784.08s)]
*  Wait, Holmes, who is the other Bostonian? [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3786.0s)]
*  Hilaria. [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3788.08s)]
*  Hello? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3789.52s)]
*  BU. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3790.32s)]
*  You've got the AOC. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3790.8s)]
*  Oh, Alexandria Cotazio-Hotes. [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3792.64s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3796.88s)]
*  And I don't think she found that accent until she left Boston, right? [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3797.6s)]
*  I mean, I've seen some clips of her at BU where none of that. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3800.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3805.44s)]
*  She was like, looked like a sorority girl. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3805.6800000000003s)]
*  No, honestly. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3808.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3809.92s)]
*  It's truly like if I were running for mayor of Chicago next year and I'm running around going, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3811.2000000000003s)]
*  top of the morning to you. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3817.36s)]
*  It's obvious what you're doing. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3821.12s)]
*  Megan's doing that. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3823.92s)]
*  Oh, hey, what's going on? [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3824.7200000000003s)]
*  We just got here in Chicago just looking out for the crime on the streets and all that. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3826.4s)]
*  Watching out for my wee woods. [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3830.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3833.36s)]
*  Speaking of Hilaria, I think we all agree. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3834.64s)]
*  Are we all in agreement that Hilaria won or would you guys like to disagree? [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3837.36s)]
*  Anybody have anything? [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3841.6s)]
*  Man, it's so hard to disagree with that. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3842.32s)]
*  I would say that Kamala deserves special points for doing it on a national stage. [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3845.92s)]
*  When you know everyone is watching. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3850.2400000000002s)]
*  Right. [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3851.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3852.32s)]
*  And in so many different flavors, right? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3852.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3854.96s)]
*  That's true. [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3855.76s)]
*  You know what, it's worth consideration. [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3856.96s)]
*  Megan, she has a full spectrum of options. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3860.88s)]
*  You want Jamaican, we got some of that. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3865.52s)]
*  Totally. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3867.92s)]
*  We can go urban, we can go workforce, we can go southern. [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3868.32s)]
*  There's versatility. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3873.28s)]
*  It's the best actor. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3874.4s)]
*  It's multiple personality disorder. [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3875.6800000000003s)]
*  No, but if you're a Hollywood casting agent. [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3879.6800000000003s)]
*  It's dexterity and talent. [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3882.32s)]
*  Yeah, if you're casting for SNL, you got to go with Kamala. [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3884.24s)]
*  She can do any bit. [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3888.3199999999997s)]
*  We can go Rastafarian. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3890.4s)]
*  We can go Latina, we can go preacher, we can do the black santa. [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3894.56s)]
*  I don't know what she's doing there with her little urban whatever. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3899.44s)]
*  She seamlessly transitions from Bob Marley to MLK. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3902.7999999999997s)]
*  It's amazing. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3906.96s)]
*  And you're right. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3907.6s)]
*  That accent, it's like her channeling John Ossoff channeling Barack Obama. [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3909.2s)]
*  So it's like a copy of a copy. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3913.68s)]
*  You know, it's like a third rate. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3916.16s)]
*  All right. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3919.04s)]
*  So while we're on the subject of Ilaria, she and Alec have this reality TV show. [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3919.68s)]
*  It must not be doing well because they're clearly now making a point of doing and saying very weird [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3925.2s)]
*  things to try to get into segments like the one that I'm doing right now. [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3931.2s)]
*  And it's working because they're very strange people. [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3935.12s)]
*  The following clip went everywhere. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3939.12s)]
*  We could have raised it earlier in the week, but we saved it for our friends [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3940.72s)]
*  from the variety program. [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3946.0s)]
*  And you will see why. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3947.36s)]
*  She's one of the loves of her life naked. [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3948.72s)]
*  He was one of the loves of her life. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3951.84s)]
*  We went to go see him on Broadway and he was naked. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3953.12s)]
*  We went to go see Take Me Out, the musical that our dear friend Scott Ellis directed. [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3955.36s)]
*  And all these baseball players were in the locker room and they're all turned around [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3959.76s)]
*  naked with their dogs hanging out. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3962.72s)]
*  And he's there, her boyfriend, and I recognize him. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3964.72s)]
*  And when he turns around with his personality hanging, I'm like, oh, oh, oh, okay. [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3967.7599999999998s)]
*  He had like a clarinet hanging from his pants. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3974.96s)]
*  The guy literally turns around and we're all like, ah, ah. [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3978.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, we go out into the lobby, we meet them all. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3983.2s)]
*  And her boyfriend comes in and I'm like, hey, how you doing? [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3986.08s)]
*  And I was like, I'm going to stay over here. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3988.64s)]
*  And you can't pay attention to what he's saying. [[01:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3990.96s)]
*  He's standing right here talking to me. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3993.8399999999997s)]
*  I'm sitting there like I'm going. [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3994.96s)]
*  And he's looking at me going, yeah, you know, the show and this and that. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3996.56s)]
*  I'm like, you have like a baseball bat. [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=3999.84s)]
*  They use stuff into your pants every day. [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4003.52s)]
*  How does that work? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4005.36s)]
*  Let's move on from that subject. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4007.12s)]
*  Oh, that's good TV. [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4014.64s)]
*  The fellas can't speak currently. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4015.84s)]
*  I've actually seen that clip. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4017.12s)]
*  He ends it with saying, it had to be said. [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4020.64s)]
*  It had to be said. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4023.12s)]
*  There's a lot going on there. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4026.32s)]
*  Is dong an appropriate word for the fellow down south in Rio? [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4028.48s)]
*  I thought that was much more of a dated reference from like 16 candles. [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4033.44s)]
*  Dong, is that still in the vernacular? [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4037.12s)]
*  You know, we've got a lot that we explore on this topic. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4040.2400000000002s)]
*  Probably not appropriate for the SiriusXM crowd, but we have many nicknames that we [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4043.84s)]
*  could probably share with people. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4049.04s)]
*  Dong is a pretty common vernacular, but not necessarily one that you would use [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4050.88s)]
*  to describe your wife's ex-boyfriend. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4055.44s)]
*  But in general, you're telling me it's still in favor. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4059.04s)]
*  This is good to know. [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4060.96s)]
*  How about the personality? [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4061.84s)]
*  He referred to it as the personality. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4064.0s)]
*  He turned around with his personality out. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4066.0s)]
*  Is that that's got to be a new one. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4068.16s)]
*  That's new to me. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4070.08s)]
*  Also new and I thought innovative was the clarinet. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4072.0s)]
*  That was something that was brand new. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4076.88s)]
*  That makes it sound like there's somewhat of a skin problem. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4078.4s)]
*  It also alludes to how it was used perhaps. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4081.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4092.4s)]
*  This is a classy show. [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4094.3199999999997s)]
*  What was the last thing? [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4098.4s)]
*  Oh, the baseball bat. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4099.2s)]
*  Because it really hurt Alec. [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4101.68s)]
*  I think that's why that came to mind. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4103.28s)]
*  It really hurt him. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4104.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4105.44s)]
*  You don't want to think about stuff like that. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4106.48s)]
*  Has anyone given a moment's thought to those that came before them with their spouse? [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4108.32s)]
*  I'm not sure this is... [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4116.16s)]
*  Maybe it's just because we haven't seen them naked. [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4117.599999999999s)]
*  He keeps referring to the guy as her boyfriend, like present tense. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4122.48s)]
*  All it did was remind me of President Trump. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4125.92s)]
*  What's the name of that dinner that happens in New York? [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4129.28s)]
*  Al Smith. [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4132.0s)]
*  Al Smith's dinner where he was like, [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4132.5599999999995s)]
*  I'm talking about the dudes for Kamala. [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4135.04s)]
*  They're all voting for Kamala, but it's fine because all their wives [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4137.04s)]
*  and wives' boyfriends are voting for me. [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4140.0s)]
*  Alec Baldwin, I think he was talking about you. [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4143.12s)]
*  I don't know what's going on in that strange relationship, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4147.44s)]
*  but I do know they're actively seeking attention because they need ratings on their show. [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4150.08s)]
*  I feel like I would be remiss if I did not mention, [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4156.0s)]
*  as we're talking about people who have changed themselves dramatically, [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4160.32s)]
*  in mentioning a Republican controversy today that involves Christy Noem. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4164.24s)]
*  Christy Noem is our Department of Homeland Security head, as you know. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4170.5599999999995s)]
*  She's a controversial pick. [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4174.88s)]
*  The reason she wasn't chosen for vice president was probably that ridiculous memoir she wrote, [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4176.8s)]
*  confessing to killing her puppy, Cricket, who she shot in the face for no reason, [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4182.08s)]
*  right after, before she killed their goat, and I don't know, like a set of horses. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4188.32s)]
*  No, not really. No horses died, just the puppy and the family goat. [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4193.84s)]
*  And then the daughter got off the bus and was like, where's Cricket? [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4198.0s)]
*  Anyway, there was that. [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4201.12s)]
*  There was an alleged affair with Corey Lewandowski, which was reported by The Daily Mail, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4203.04s)]
*  which we talked about in the show. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4206.64s)]
*  She got probably downgraded off of VP and she got made DHS, and I said to this audience, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4208.24s)]
*  well, I will be rooting for her because that is a very big job. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4213.12s)]
*  And what we've seen so far is a lot of photo ops. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4216.96s)]
*  She went on, was it Fox News, wearing her FBI DHS jacket? [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4223.12s)]
*  She just finished a field operation while she was actually doing the arrests. [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4228.4800000000005s)]
*  That's cosplaying. [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4232.88s)]
*  All right, we'll show you that picture when we get it. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4233.92s)]
*  Then we saw her out there rounding up illegals on her horse with her cowboy hat, [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4236.96s)]
*  which I said, all right, I'm going to have to give her a pass on that because she actually [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4242.72s)]
*  was raised on a ranch in South Dakota. [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4246.64s)]
*  That's not necessarily cosplaying, right? [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4250.08s)]
*  But it was obviously a curated photo op that she put together to make sure she looked. [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4253.44s)]
*  In all this, she's got false eyelashes, heavy eyeliner, the big lips with all the gloss, [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4259.04s)]
*  the heavy blush. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4264.48s)]
*  She's camera ready. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4266.4s)]
*  I would be for doing a television hit, but maybe not while I was riding the horses [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4267.759999999999s)]
*  and capturing illegals. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4272.639999999999s)]
*  And then she went next level last night. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4274.879999999999s)]
*  By the way, this is after she got in trouble for being a spokesperson for a dental office [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4278.08s)]
*  when she was still the governor of South Dakota and showing off her fake veneers, [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4282.48s)]
*  which she's really proud of. [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4286.959999999999s)]
*  Like she's very obsessed with the new look, which is dramatically different than the old look. [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4288.08s)]
*  And then we see her last night dropping this video from that El Salvadorian prison. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4292.799999999999s)]
*  Watch. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4303.2s)]
*  I also want everybody to know if you come to our country illegally, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4304.799999999999s)]
*  this is one of the consequences you could face. [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4307.839999999999s)]
*  First of all, do not come to our country illegally. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4310.32s)]
*  You will be removed and you will be prosecuted. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4313.52s)]
*  But know that this facility is one of the tools in our toolkit that we will use [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4316.0s)]
*  if you commit crimes against the American people. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4320.32s)]
*  Okay. [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4323.52s)]
*  Standing behind her in a cage are dozens of shirtless prisoners in the El Salvadorian jail, [[01:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4325.04s)]
*  looking kind of scared, confused. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4336.320000000001s)]
*  They're being used as props for her photo op in her skin tight shirt with their hair perfectly [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4340.56s)]
*  curled and quaffed. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4347.92s)]
*  And again, the makeup as she tries to sound tough with these prisoners behind her as her background [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4349.040000000001s)]
*  as like truly her human props in her photo. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4358.400000000001s)]
*  And I'm telling you, you guys, it's fucked up. [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4362.8s)]
*  I have no empathy for Venezuelan gang members who wound up in an El Salvadorian jail. [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4366.56s)]
*  But this is messed up. [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4375.04s)]
*  I mean, truly, like to use them in this way as her backdrop to show us how cool she is [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4377.84s)]
*  and how tough she is, is gross and utterly unhelpful to those of us who have been out there [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4383.76s)]
*  arguing that Trump is within his rights to round up these illegal in America and send [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4392.160000000001s)]
*  them there with very limited due process. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4399.360000000001s)]
*  Utterly unhelpful. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4403.280000000001s)]
*  So any thoughts on that? [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4405.6s)]
*  You know, she's had a tendency in recent years. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4408.96s)]
*  I mean, she started as a congresswoman from South Dakota, a wonderful, [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4411.68s)]
*  cute like I've got to know her staff and whatnot a little bit on Capitol Hill. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4416.240000000001s)]
*  But in recent years, if she's got a major glaring weakness, it's that she gets out in front a little [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4420.8s)]
*  too public of a way. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4426.96s)]
*  I mean, one of the things that caught my eye early on in the administration was them deciding [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4428.16s)]
*  that they were going to run a bunch of public service announcements using taxpayer dollars, [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4432.4s)]
*  but with her basically to camera. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4437.76s)]
*  And I think the challenge for that is you're in Donald Trump's administration. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4439.92s)]
*  And Donald Trump's the star of this show, right? [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4445.28s)]
*  It's not Kristi Noem. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4448.56s)]
*  And I think everybody sort of understands that. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4450.4800000000005s)]
*  At least it seems that this administration understands that a lot better than the first [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4453.04s)]
*  time around. [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4456.88s)]
*  But she's kind of getting herself into a territory where it's a little overexposed. [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4458.72s)]
*  I mean, everybody knows that Tom Homan is walking around literally showing up in a different [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4463.200000000001s)]
*  place every day, deporting some incredibly violent gang member somewhere, and he's getting [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4467.120000000001s)]
*  the job done. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4472.96s)]
*  And his only publicity at all is when some journo asks him a horrible question, he just [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4474.0s)]
*  dresses him down and moves on, right? [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4479.76s)]
*  I think that's a better approach. [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4481.84s)]
*  I don't remember another DHS secretary showing up for TV hits like this. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4485.04s)]
*  Hold on. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4490.24s)]
*  We'll put it on the board. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4490.56s)]
*  Like trying to look like, look at her with the long dangling earrings and the hat and [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4491.52s)]
*  like the jacket. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4498.96s)]
*  This is the whole thing feels like an act. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4501.04s)]
*  And I'm all for women taking over these powerful, tough, important positions, but I'm embarrassed [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4505.44s)]
*  for how she's presenting herself while doing it. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4512.08s)]
*  Like maybe it's time. [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4514.639999999999s)]
*  And as you know, look, I'm not really in a position to cast stones here from my made-up [[01:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4516.24s)]
*  face at my desk, but I can guarantee you that if I became secretary of Homeland Security, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4520.88s)]
*  I would not be laying on the lip gloss, the lashes and the blush before I started talking [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4529.2s)]
*  about illegals I made sure wound up in El Salvador or cosplaying up with my DHS wear [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4536.4s)]
*  before I went on Fox News. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4544.4s)]
*  This is a deeply insecure person and I'm sorry, but it doesn't, who are we if we only have [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4546.32s)]
*  honest talk for the left? [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4552.96s)]
*  This is honest talk from someone who's a Trump supporter that he needs to rein her in because [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4554.8s)]
*  she's becoming an embarrassment. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4559.6s)]
*  It's all a little much, you know, all of the stuff, the ads that, you know, the video in [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4561.6s)]
*  front of the prison. [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4566.96s)]
*  And the reason why back to Holmes's point is like, it seems sort of excessive in spiking [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4568.4800000000005s)]
*  the football and you're getting out ahead of the Trump administration. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4572.88s)]
*  Let Donald Trump talk about how he wants to talk about the El Salvadorian. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4575.360000000001s)]
*  And by the way, there's ongoing litigation over exactly what it is that she's talking [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4578.96s)]
*  about there. [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4583.84s)]
*  I mean, that guarantee, I guarantee you will be entered as an exhibit in that courtroom. [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4584.32s)]
*  The one thing I would say in her defense, the one thing I would say in her defense is [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4591.12s)]
*  like the PSA's, if it gets people to self-deport, fantastic. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4594.5599999999995s)]
*  If that video, you know, in front of those criminals gets less migrants to try to cross [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4599.44s)]
*  the border and smuggle drugs and go into this country, good. [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4603.759999999999s)]
*  I take your point. [[01:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4607.679999999999s)]
*  I see that. [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4608.4s)]
*  And actually, I in her defense, when she put that out last night, it's getting way more [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4609.12s)]
*  likes than it is getting criticism. [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4614.0s)]
*  And most of the people criticizing it are like on the left and against this policy to [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4615.76s)]
*  begin with. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4619.76s)]
*  So I think I'm in a unique spot because I actually support this policy and I want more [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4620.56s)]
*  illegal gang members deported to El Salvador. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4624.48s)]
*  However, the way to convince Judge Boasberg, who will be the ultimate trier of fact on [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4627.04s)]
*  this, that we're not winning this fight right now. [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4633.52s)]
*  We just lost to the court of appeals and the Supreme Court may not take it immediately. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4635.6s)]
*  So Judge Boasberg is in control at the moment is really not to give him more reasons to [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4640.24s)]
*  suspect what kind of treatment they're going to have down in El Salvador. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4645.5199999999995s)]
*  And to take them and make them look like little lab rats behind prison bars, looking dazed [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4650.5599999999995s)]
*  and confused and shirtless as she stands there totally glammed to the nines is a bad fucking [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4657.599999999999s)]
*  move. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4665.04s)]
*  I can say this as a lawyer. [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4665.599999999999s)]
*  This is not what you'd want introduced into the record, Christy. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4667.84s)]
*  And what should have been done, Duncan, to your point on deterrence is let's stick with [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4672.88s)]
*  the video we have that's already out there of the prisoners being processed. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4678.32s)]
*  It's bad enough, frankly, of them bent over and being put assembly line as they get checked [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4682.400000000001s)]
*  out and put into the prison. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4689.12s)]
*  I'm not really that comfortable with that, but it's fine. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4691.84s)]
*  These are gang members. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4694.32s)]
*  These are fucking people who killed Americans. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4695.12s)]
*  So, you know, cry me a river, some of them. [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4696.72s)]
*  But there is a debate about who got in there that shouldn't have. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4699.280000000001s)]
*  There were two mistakes made. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4702.56s)]
*  A woman got in and she was sent back home. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4704.16s)]
*  A guy from Nicaragua who clearly is not a Venezuelan gang member got in and he was sent [[01:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4707.12s)]
*  back home. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4711.68s)]
*  Anyway, I'm just saying right now we're debating over how much due process they should get [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4712.16s)]
*  while we figure out whether they really are trend to Aragua and whether we should have [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4716.400000000001s)]
*  shipped them to this prison and shots of them looking. [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4720.56s)]
*  Maybe it's for the camera, but like scared and disoriented and a little shell shocked [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4725.28s)]
*  aren't helpful. [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4730.96s)]
*  Okay, that's my that's my take on the matter. [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4732.16s)]
*  Feel free to disagree. [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4736.0s)]

*  I know it's it's absolutely bad for the legal system and I'm counting on the Supreme Court [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4769.68s)]
*  to hurry up and do its job and help us out there. [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4773.84s)]

*  I'm fine with zero due process before we do that, right? [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=4805.44s)]

*  I like it. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5016.96s)]
*  I like it a lot. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5017.599999999999s)]
*  Big year for CBS. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5019.04s)]
*  I mean, Smug is our resident bracketologist here. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5021.04s)]
*  We all put a lot of work into the seedings this year. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5024.56s)]
*  This is our fifth annual, Megan, and every year it's a body of work. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5028.240000000001s)]
*  You got to do a lot of things throughout a calendar year in order to qualify for the [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5034.320000000001s)]
*  tournament, and then we seed you appropriately on how we thought you did throughout the year. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5038.080000000001s)]
*  And that's the thing is, so I mean, it starts with 66. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5041.68s)]
*  We have two playing games. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5044.0s)]
*  We're talking about it's the same size as March Madness. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5044.8s)]
*  There are 64 hacks that are going head to head. [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5046.88s)]
*  It gets voted on online on X. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5049.68s)]
*  It's huge. [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5051.76s)]
*  I mean, we've so far had throughout the history of these over 10 million votes cast. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5052.32s)]
*  So I mean, it's bigger than some congressional races in terms of the number of votes that [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5056.639999999999s)]
*  go into this. [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5060.639999999999s)]
*  But also it's so great because I tag every single one of these hacks. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5061.679999999999s)]
*  I add them on X every single time. [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5066.96s)]
*  And very frequently I get blocked. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5070.24s)]
*  They start tweeting about how mad they are. [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5072.719999999999s)]
*  They're like, I'm so unbiased. [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5074.24s)]
*  And then without fail, they get all these replies of screenshots of like Russia gate [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5075.84s)]
*  nonsense and everything else. [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5080.08s)]
*  But like home said, it's their previous year's body of work that goes into deciding it. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5081.84s)]
*  And I think to me, the story of this year is that two CBS people got the number one [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5085.6s)]
*  seat in each of their divisions. [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5092.08s)]
*  Further, they were the two who also managed a vice president debate. [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5094.4800000000005s)]
*  This has to stop too. [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5099.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it's really remarkable. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5100.64s)]
*  Yeah, this is like that trans movie about the Colombian guy who wanted to be trans and [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5102.72s)]
*  they got all the nominations. [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5107.6s)]
*  That's CBS right now. [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5108.96s)]
*  They got all the nominations. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5110.0s)]
*  But I do. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5113.2s)]
*  I mean, I have one bone to pick because it seems that the latest matchup has this Eugene [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5114.0s)]
*  Daniels up against Don Lemon, who's only an eight seed. [[01:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5119.12s)]
*  What kind of disrespect is that to Don Lemon's hack? [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5122.64s)]
*  Let's explain. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5125.28s)]
*  This is very, very, very important, Megan. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5125.92s)]
*  We have a proprietary methodology. [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5128.0s)]
*  In college basketball, Ken Pomeroy has this Ken Palm, which he uses as like a quotient [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5130.08s)]
*  to rank basketball teams. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5134.96s)]
*  We have this methodology that includes everything from like how liberal they are, how crazy [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5137.04s)]
*  they are, how much of a liar they are, and then exposure. [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5142.72s)]
*  And like Don Lemon dropped in the seating because his quotient and exposure has gone [[01:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5146.24s)]
*  down a little. [[01:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5151.04s)]
*  He's been fired twice. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5152.0s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5153.36s)]
*  I've never seen Duncan this animated about any other subject that we've ever discussed [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5154.08s)]
*  with him. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5158.08s)]
*  I put a lot of thought into this and included a lot of work. [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5158.48s)]
*  It included a lot of numbers. [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5161.84s)]
*  I might be on the spectrum. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5163.04s)]
*  Now, is it going to be, is it like the NCAA March Madness where we've learned this year, [[01:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5165.04s)]
*  there's no more Cinderella stories because it's basically because we're allowing the [[01:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5171.76s)]
*  athletes to make money and so they can switch to schools and they're leaving their small [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5175.92s)]
*  schools and they're all going to the big schools. [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5179.52s)]
*  That's just good comparison. [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5181.04s)]
*  So is that what's happening in hack madness too? [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5182.240000000001s)]
*  Or could there be a sleeper surprise? [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5184.4800000000005s)]
*  Like I would say Eugene Daniels kind of a sleeper surprise. [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5186.0s)]
*  Not a household name. [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5189.200000000001s)]
*  No, not a household name. [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5190.72s)]
*  I mean, there's an inherent bias as we've done this over five years for people who are [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5192.08s)]
*  on TV. [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5195.84s)]
*  They're recognizable. [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5197.04s)]
*  All the crazy stuff that they've done is visual so people can actually see it. [[01:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5198.24s)]
*  There's an inherent bias against print whose body of work, might I say, is extraordinary, [[01:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5202.88s)]
*  but they don't get the kind of representation that's necessary to make it all the way to [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5208.24s)]
*  the Final Four and this kind of thing. [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5212.48s)]
*  We're hoping that that sort of works its way out a little bit, but there's only like [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5214.08s)]
*  six print journalists left after one round. [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5217.44s)]
*  So yeah, I mean, this is, you know, household names go a long way. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5220.56s)]
*  And there were some newcomers that went down really hard in the first round and I'm telling [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5224.56s)]
*  you, I mean, as much as some of these people have tried their best, they are not going [[01:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5229.04s)]
*  to overcome Margaret Brennan. [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5233.4400000000005s)]
*  She has done Yeoman's work building towards this championship and I don't think she's [[01:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5234.8s)]
*  going to be denied this year. [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5239.84s)]
*  A real powerhouse. [[01:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5240.8s)]
*  Wait, what did Jeffrey Goldberg even make the dance? [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5241.92s)]
*  He was probably not even on your radar. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5244.56s)]
*  No, he was a bubble team. [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5245.84s)]
*  He was a bubble team. [[01:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5247.200000000001s)]
*  He was a bubble team, but it happened. [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5248.0s)]
*  All of this happened a week after the bracket came out. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5249.44s)]
*  And so, sorry, sir. [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5253.04s)]
*  Like, sorry. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5254.0s)]
*  Late submission. [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5254.719999999999s)]
*  He could have been, you know, in terms of what he's done lately. [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5255.5199999999995s)]
*  Yeah, a serious contender. [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5259.679999999999s)]
*  After that soundbite, we played at the top of the show. [[01:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5261.679999999999s)]
*  I could have elevated him a couple of seeds at least. [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5264.0s)]
*  You mean we have some upsets? [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5268.4s)]
*  This is breaking news because the next round of Hack Madness is currently live on X. [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5270.24s)]
*  Everyone visit comfortably. [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5274.799999999999s)]
*  Smug on X. [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5275.839999999999s)]
*  Can people still get in on this, you guys? [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5276.48s)]
*  Or is it two ways? [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5278.0s)]
*  Well, you can still vote, yeah. [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5278.64s)]
*  Where do they go? [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5280.56s)]
*  Well, Eugene. [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5281.04s)]
*  You vote at comfortably smug on X. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5283.12s)]
*  I had it pinned right on my profile. [[01:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5285.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, Eugene Daniels right now is losing to Don Lemon. [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5287.12s)]
*  He's a one seed. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5291.04s)]
*  Don Lemon's an eight seed. [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5291.92s)]
*  Upset. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5293.12s)]
*  Supporting. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5293.52s)]
*  I got Anna Navarro's beating Chris Hayes right now. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5293.92s)]
*  Oh, that's surprising. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5297.36s)]
*  It's very surprising. [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5297.76s)]
*  Keith Olbermann is beating Sonny Hostin. [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5300.24s)]
*  She was a two seed. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5302.4s)]
*  Boy, she did a lot of work this year. [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5303.44s)]
*  The power of the View is really starting to wane. [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5305.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5308.88s)]
*  Well, and Joy, what's her name from the View got knocked out? [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5309.599999999999s)]
*  Joy Mayhar. [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5313.839999999999s)]
*  Joy Mayhar. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5314.88s)]
*  What about Joy? [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5315.839999999999s)]
*  What did you do with Joy Reid? [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5316.5599999999995s)]
*  Because now no visibility, but I mean very high up on the Hacker-y scale. [[01:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5317.759999999999s)]
*  Body of work throughout the year, right? [[01:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5322.48s)]
*  She had that kind of visibility throughout a calendar year and so she richly deserved it. [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5324.16s)]
*  And it's paying off for Anna Navarro, right? [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5328.719999999999s)]
*  Because in addition to like that, she's also going on like Bill Maher and she's on CNN a lot. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5330.4s)]
*  And so all that visibility means she's going to make a long run here in the tournament. [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5334.88s)]
*  All to crown the biggest hack in all of political reporting. [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5338.0s)]
*  Who did you guys pick? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5341.04s)]
*  You know how we have to pick our number one? [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5341.84s)]
*  This year I went with Duke for all sorts of reasons on the other bracket, [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5343.04s)]
*  which has completely collapsed by the way, my bracket. [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5346.72s)]
*  But who do you guys have for number one? [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5349.2s)]
*  Did you all pick different people? [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5351.04s)]
*  I think we might have picked different people. [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5352.64s)]
*  I will say I had three CBS people in my final four, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5354.24s)]
*  but I ultimately ended up going with Nicole Wallace. [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5358.08s)]
*  I thought her making fun of the kid at the State of the Union was just a, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5360.64s)]
*  it's a recency bias perhaps, but sometimes that propels a team. [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5367.6s)]
*  She goes in day in, day out with the hackery. [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5374.400000000001s)]
*  It started her like Cinderella run started at that VP debate. [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5377.6s)]
*  And then you saw things as recent as when she tried to go after Marco Rubio on Sunday. [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5382.240000000001s)]
*  She keeps at it week after week with the hacker. [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5386.64s)]
*  Humiliation. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5389.200000000001s)]
*  I'm with Smug on this. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5390.72s)]
*  I'm counting on America's love of JD Vance, [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5392.24s)]
*  America's love of memes, and America's hatred of Margaret. [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5395.4400000000005s)]
*  Margaret. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5399.04s)]
*  You know, I don't really care Margaret. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5399.52s)]
*  I don't care Margaret. [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5401.68s)]
*  It was a huge moment. [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5402.56s)]
*  It became a whole thing. [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5404.0s)]
*  I'm also a big believer in Margaret Brennan this year. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5405.36s)]
*  You guys all picked her? [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5407.52s)]
*  Yeah, I did. [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5408.88s)]
*  Because this tournament is about the big moments like she did in the debate. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5409.92s)]
*  It's also about doing what you're doing when nobody else is watching. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5413.4400000000005s)]
*  Day in, day out. [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5417.28s)]
*  That's her show. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5418.0s)]
*  Nobody watches her show. [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5418.8s)]
*  But in the big moments, you know, when like Marco Rubio dunks on her or JD Vance dunks on her, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5420.8s)]
*  that's on X. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5427.04s)]
*  People see it. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5427.84s)]
*  She's performing well then too. [[01:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5428.56s)]
*  So I'm telling you, I think this is hers to lose. [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5430.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5433.4400000000005s)]
*  Which blonde news anchor was it who said to JD, like only a few apartment buildings have [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5435.76s)]
*  been taken over by the Venezuelan gangs? [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5444.0s)]
*  Who was that, Steve? [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5446.88s)]
*  It might have been Martha Raditz. [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5448.32s)]
*  Yeah, it was Martha Raditz. [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5449.52s)]
*  I think it was Martha Raditz. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5450.16s)]
*  We didn't see enough of her this year. [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5451.52s)]
*  She got an honorable mention in there. [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5452.16s)]
*  I didn't see enough of her. [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5454.24s)]
*  But she was a bubble, too. [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5456.48s)]
*  The exposure's low. [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5457.52s)]
*  Yeah, she could be a bubble. [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5458.72s)]
*  Yeah, she could be a bubble. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5459.6s)]
*  I mean, Catherine Mayer. [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5460.72s)]
*  It's tough. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5461.84s)]
*  Marr, she got in there super late, you know, media executive. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5462.4s)]
*  God, if she had just had this testimony, what might have been? [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5466.08s)]
*  In any event, we'll continue. [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5469.76s)]
*  I will tell you, Megan, there's one really special Cinderella story in this year's tournament. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5470.96s)]
*  A former champion who had not made the bracket for a couple of years [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5476.32s)]
*  due to an unfortunate employment situation has made a return. [[01:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5479.759999999999s)]
*  It is now working his way through the bracket, the potato himself, Brian Stelter. [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5483.759999999999s)]
*  Such a story. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5487.599999999999s)]
*  Gets far by CNN, begs his way back. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5488.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5490.96s)]
*  I mean, it's a three-seater fighter. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5491.28s)]
*  It's what's built this country. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5493.599999999999s)]
*  How can you root against him? [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5496.639999999999s)]
*  I can only imagine the halftime speech he's giving the rest of the team. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5498.24s)]
*  Great. [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5502.4s)]
*  While we're on the subject of actresses and awards and hacks, [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5503.12s)]
*  do we have a moment for Rachel Zegler and Snow White? [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5508.08s)]
*  Because there is an update in that story today. [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5510.72s)]
*  There was an in-depth piece, like a behind the scenes piece. [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5514.5599999999995s)]
*  Was it Variety? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5518.4s)]
*  Talking about how they've been in a full meltdown about this girl for a couple of years now. [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5519.84s)]
*  And how they had her tweet out like a little, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5527.2s)]
*  yay, Snow White, can't wait, so excited, I love to play her. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5530.96s)]
*  And she did it and got like millions of views and they were like, good job, Rachel. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5534.32s)]
*  And then she like minutes later followed it up with, and never forget, Free Palestine. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5539.2s)]
*  This is just like a few months after 10-7. [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5544.64s)]
*  It was like, hadn't even been a year. [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5547.68s)]
*  And they were like, my God, what? [[01:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5549.36s)]
*  And isn't her co-star Jewish? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5554.0s)]
*  Yes, Gal Gadot. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5556.56s)]
*  Gadot, whatever. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5558.08s)]
*  I mean, wow. [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5559.04s)]
*  She's Jewish. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5560.96s)]
*  And apparently this actually all hell broke loose. [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5561.84s)]
*  They started getting death threats. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5565.92s)]
*  She's Israeli. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5569.76s)]
*  And I think served in the IDF. [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5571.6s)]
*  They tried. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5573.92s)]
*  They flew an executive, one of the producers, out to go visit personally with Rachel Zegler to say, [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5575.36s)]
*  could you please take that down? [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5580.32s)]
*  Because we understand you can have your political views, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5582.24s)]
*  but those aren't really helpful. [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5584.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, you're trying to build an audience for a movie. [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5585.92s)]
*  Maybe you could save them for like your diary and your friends, but like maybe not. [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5587.76s)]
*  Maybe just take the tweet down and she wouldn't. [[01:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5591.52s)]
*  And then they had to hire a special media consultant for her to follow her around all the time [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5594.8s)]
*  and make sure she didn't continue shitting on Snow White and the Prince and Young Love [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5600.16s)]
*  and women who want to get married and Steven Spielberg, the executive producer of her previous [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5606.24s)]
*  movie and white people who she claims wanted to know if she was really a Latina on her first movie. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5611.28s)]
*  The list was really long. [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5618.719999999999s)]
*  And then the son of that producer who got on the plane to go over and say, [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5620.96s)]
*  would you please for the love of God take this down? [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5626.24s)]
*  And she wouldn't. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5628.5599999999995s)]
*  Was on Instagram yesterday, admitting it all. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5629.84s)]
*  There were a variety of people being like, of course, what would you do when you have this [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5634.48s)]
*  narcissistic nightmare trying to ruin a film that you've put hundreds of millions of dollars into [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5638.4s)]
*  that's employing all these working class people? [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5644.48s)]
*  She refused to keep her fat mouth shut. [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5647.12s)]
*  A great spilling of the tea. [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5650.719999999999s)]
*  So I don't think she's in the running toward the real Academy Awards. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5654.48s)]
*  She wasn't right. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5659.5199999999995s)]
*  She was not nominated for this past year because the film hadn't come out. [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5660.4s)]
*  But you tell me you're not Hollywood guys, but you are political odds. [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5664.16s)]
*  So what do you think the odds are of this person working ever again? [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5669.44s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5675.28s)]
*  Doesn't it seem like it's almost a prerequisite in Hollywood? [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5675.92s)]
*  Maybe things have changed a little bit. [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5678.72s)]
*  Megan, tell me, isn't this the one where they actually took the dwarves out of the seven dwarves? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5681.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5685.679999999999s)]
*  We have CGI dwarves now. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5686.24s)]
*  Okay. [[01:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5688.8s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5689.28s)]
*  Because little people didn't need jobs either. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5689.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5692.0s)]
*  But Peter Dinklage wanted the whole field to himself. [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5692.4800000000005s)]
*  He kicked the ladder down behind him. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5695.68s)]
*  Unless it's me. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5698.0s)]
*  He kicked the ladder. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5699.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, he got his money in Hollywood. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5700.72s)]
*  Now he's like going higher and higher. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5702.24s)]
*  Nicely done, Smug. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5703.12s)]
*  The ladder. [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5703.92s)]
*  That was nicely done. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5704.4800000000005s)]
*  That was low. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5705.92s)]
*  No, but I mean he got his money acting as a little person. [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5709.2s)]
*  Now he's saying it's demeaning for them to have those roles. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5711.6s)]
*  He acted as a dwarf on like the most popular show on TV for 10 years. [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5714.0s)]
*  Made millions of dollars. [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5717.6s)]
*  Now he's like how dare people hire dwarves to act as dwarves. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5718.4800000000005s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5721.44s)]
*  The thing is... [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5722.24s)]
*  He got his money and then kicked the ladder down behind him. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5722.5599999999995s)]
*  Well, that's what really shocks me about this story. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5724.16s)]
*  Disney and all these media companies, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5728.24s)]
*  they invest hundreds of millions of dollars into these projects. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5730.24s)]
*  Have they ever thought about maybe like a little bit of like, [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5735.599999999999s)]
*  I don't know, vulnerability study, opposition research, [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5738.16s)]
*  that sort of thing before you go and hire some zoomer who's a lunatic? [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5741.04s)]
*  Yeah, but they're all lunatics. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5745.28s)]
*  I mean, how many people in Hollywood, maybe not to this extent, [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5746.5599999999995s)]
*  but how many people do you hear about actors you love? [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5750.88s)]
*  You love what? [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5753.4400000000005s)]
*  Like Robert De Niro. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5753.84s)]
*  I love like basically every movie he's ever done. [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5754.8s)]
*  Every time that guy opens his mouth as a private citizen, [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5756.88s)]
*  I'm like, oh my God, you can't possibly believe that. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5759.6s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5763.4400000000005s)]
*  So it's like if you're trying to vulnerability study it, [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5764.08s)]
*  where do you start? [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5768.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5769.2s)]
*  I don't think they're all this bad. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5770.32s)]
*  I think most young ingenues can be scared into just being quiet [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5771.84s)]
*  until the movie comes out. [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5777.68s)]
*  At least like please give the movie a chance understanding [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5778.64s)]
*  that Republicans buy sneakers too, you know, to Michael Jordan. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5782.08s)]
*  Like just give it a chance. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5785.4400000000005s)]
*  There are a few actors now that are less afraid of sort of showing their conservative views. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5786.72s)]
*  It's also a generational thing. [[01:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5791.76s)]
*  I mean, her generation has basically grown up being told every opinion you have, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5793.04s)]
*  post it online, share it with the world. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5800.8s)]
*  You're the most special person. [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5802.64s)]
*  The world revolves around you. [[01:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5804.160000000001s)]
*  Everyone has to change to fit your beliefs because you're so special [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5805.52s)]
*  and you're so important and everything you say is validated and that's your truth. [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5809.6s)]
*  And that's not going away anytime soon. [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5813.120000000001s)]
*  The other problem is Disney keeps doing this shit. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5815.040000000001s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5817.84s)]
*  They don't care how many times they lose money. [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5818.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, this is- [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5820.0s)]
*  They're going to learn a lesson on this one though. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5820.72s)]
*  I don't think so. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5822.400000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're projected to lose between two and 400 million on this. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5823.040000000001s)]
*  I mean, they're still not going to learn their lesson. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5826.400000000001s)]
*  About a third of what Democrats lost on Kamala Harris. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5828.56s)]
*  And I will tell you that I think that this woman will be the governor of California. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5831.6s)]
*  Oh, God. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5837.4400000000005s)]
*  I think she is going to run and I think that Californians are looking for a step up [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5837.52s)]
*  from Gavin Newsom and I think they found their candidate. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5842.08s)]
*  I think she's going to be the governor. [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5845.68s)]
*  Maybe a formidable voice of the left. [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5846.88s)]
*  Here's some good news. [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5850.88s)]
*  Speaking of the woke wars, Anheuser-Busch declines for the first time in over 30 years [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5851.92s)]
*  to sponsor the Pride Fest parade in St. Louis. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5858.72s)]
*  That's Bud Light learning its lesson. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5866.320000000001s)]
*  They won't sponsor the Pride Fest and several other companies are saying, we're out. [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5869.280000000001s)]
*  This LGBTQ Pride Fest is now openly complaining saying, we don't understand. [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5876.08s)]
*  DEI is somehow becoming a bad word. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5882.64s)]
*  We need these partners. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5885.4400000000005s)]
*  We need them now more than ever. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5886.72s)]
*  And they've lost hundreds of thousands of dollars as various companies refuse to pitch in, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5888.72s)]
*  including reportedly, according to the New York Times, Booz Allen Hamilton, Deloitte, Comcast, [[01:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5894.0s)]
*  and auto dealership group, Darcars, and then there's Bud Light all saying, not interested. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5901.280000000001s)]
*  This is a huge victory in an important battle that we've all been fighting. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5908.240000000001s)]
*  Will it continue, guys? [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5913.4400000000005s)]
*  What do you think? [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5914.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I do think it will continue, at least for a while. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5915.4400000000005s)]
*  All of these companies are ultimately in the business of making money and providing value [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5918.0s)]
*  to shareholders and you look at election results and for the first time, they're not talking to [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5922.08s)]
*  just a far left shakedown artist. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5927.04s)]
*  They're looking at the American people and they want to change it. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5929.84s)]
*  It's wonderful to see that they're learning their lesson. [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5933.360000000001s)]
*  Go ahead, Ashbrook. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5935.4400000000005s)]
*  You got 30 seconds. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5936.16s)]
*  I was just going to say, I grew up in a very small town. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5936.64s)]
*  We had a Fourth of July parade every year and I don't remember giant corporate sponsors [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5939.4400000000005s)]
*  coming in to make people turn out for that. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5942.96s)]
*  So I'm guessing if this parade is as popular as that one, then maybe people will still show. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5945.12s)]
*  Yeah, they can make it happen without all these corporate dollars and these corporations are [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5951.36s)]
*  looking at people like Chris Ruffo and Robbie Starbuck who's been doing such a good job of [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5956.08s)]
*  shaming them for continuing DEI policies that are divisive and racist and sexist. [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5961.04s)]
*  We've all got our eyes on them now. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5967.2s)]
*  They know they have real skin in this game. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5969.36s)]
*  They will not be universally praised. [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5971.92s)]
*  They will be publicly humiliated with their core audience like Bud Light was. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5973.44s)]
*  So I love it. [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5977.36s)]
*  It's progress. [[01:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5978.5599999999995s)]
*  Great to see you, fellas. [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5979.759999999999s)]
*  See you soon. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5981.04s)]
*  Great to see you, Megan. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5981.5199999999995s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5982.32s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5982.719999999999s)]
*  Thanks for having us. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5983.36s)]
*  All right. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5984.719999999999s)]
*  We'll be back tomorrow with Halpern and the morning meeting crew. [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5985.04s)]
*  See you then. [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLsnBcugKtQ&t=5988.08s)]
