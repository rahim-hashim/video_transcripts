Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Glenn Greenwald, host of Rumble's "System Update," to discuss the Democratic party's plummeting approval ratings in recent polls, how their opposition to Trump has shaped their identity, their lack of unifying vision or agenda, Sen. Chris Murphy’s cringe attempt to act like a social media influencer, the sudden shift in his messaging now that he has a millennial Dem operative girlfriend, whether he's actually the future of the party, Michelle Obama’s new podcast failing to gain an audience so far, her revelation that she hated being First Lady and she didn't want Barack to run for president, her complaints about Barack throughout the first two episodes, the legality surrounding the potential deportation of Mahmoud Khalil, his role as a "spokesperson" for the Columbia group, whether it matters if he supports Hamas, the New York Times finally telling the truth about the COVID lab leak theory in a column, how it's five years too late, and more. Plus Megyn shows how the Megyn Kelly Show revealed the truth about the origin of COVID back in 2022, the failures of corporate media on this issue, and more.

**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 17, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Monday. It's the start of a busy week as [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=0.0s)]
*  Tensions on the Democratic side of the aisle are rising by the day. By the way, we're back [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=6.36s)]

*  By the day there's like there's a civil war happening right now within the Democratic Party and there are calls to oust [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=48.7s)]

*  Okay, so this is very interesting. What's happening to the Democrat Party this morning on the New York Times is the daily podcast [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=161.7s)]
*  They likened it to what happened with Republicans in [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=167.3s)]
*  2009 2010 after Barack Obama won in a sweeping victory and won all you know [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=171.38000000000002s)]
*  the House the Senate and the White House and [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=177.46s)]
*  The Tea Party was born and you know health care was shoved down our throats and the Republicans just wanted one thing which was [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=179.74s)]
*  To fight fight finds some way to fight these guys and they were likening that to what we're seeing now with Dems [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=186.10000000000002s)]
*  Here are the numbers according to the polls we saw [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=193.74s)]
*  Over the weekend first there's CNN [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=197.38000000000002s)]
*  saying that [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=200.66000000000003s)]
*  Okay, let's see [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=202.58s)]
*  the Democratic Party's favorability rating stands at just [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=204.9s)]
*  29% a record low dating back to 1992 and a drop of 20 points in [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=208.38000000000002s)]
*  just [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=216.14000000000001s)]
*  Four years since January of 2021 a drop of 20 points and a record low at 29% [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=217.14000000000001s)]
*  We saw similar numbers [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  Out of NBC, so it's not a one-off NBC shows the Democratic Party with just a 27% positive rating [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=226.98s)]
*  55% negative so they're underwater by 28 points a [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=235.98s)]
*  Record low for the Democrat Party in more than 30 years of polling [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=241.01999999999998s)]
*  Why? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=247.26s)]
*  It's possible that some of that is being generated by this kind of liberal onks this kind of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=249.78s)]
*  dissatisfaction with Democratic Party leadership and this perception that they're quote-unquote not fighting hard enough not fighting Trump hard enough [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=256.09999999999997s)]
*  Whatever that might be so maybe if you ask liberals now, what do you think of the Democratic Party? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=263.26s)]
*  They'd be more inclined many of them would be to say we don't approve of that, but it's clearly much broader than that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=267.46s)]
*  I think that's just one factor [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=272.7s)]
*  the problem is if you ask me what is the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=274.7s)]
*  What was the worst problem with the Kamala Harris campaign? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=276.98s)]
*  It'd be very difficult to answer given how many problems that campaign had but if I were forced to choose the worst I would say that [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=279.7s)]
*  she never [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=286.7s)]
*  Committed to believing in anything to standing for anything Americans by the end of the campaign was like [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=288.7s)]
*  I don't even know who she is let alone what she really believes in like what are her real convictions? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=293.94s)]
*  What motivates her with Trump you always know for better for worse from people's perception? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=299.18s)]
*  For better for worse from people's perception. He doesn't hide what he what he what he believes quite the opposite [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=304.06s)]
*  So the contrast was extreme and I think in the Democratic Party more broadly [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=309.5s)]
*  Basically going back to 2015 2016 [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=315.29999999999995s)]
*  They've defined themselves by being horrified by Donald Trump by being aghast by Donald Trump by being fearful of Donald Trump by not [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=317.78s)]
*  Being Donald Trump, but there's no positive vision. There's no affirmative agenda that Americans can look at and say [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=325.65999999999997s)]
*  This is what I like [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=332.70000000000005s)]
*  So even if you see a softening and approval ratings for Trump and you see it a little bit not very much [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=334.46000000000004s)]
*  But on certain issues at least it doesn't translate into higher support for the Democratic Party because they don't provide an alternative [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=339.58000000000004s)]
*  It's just we're gonna fight Trump but based on what based on what set of values or policies or even ideology? Nobody knows [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=346.90000000000003s)]
*  Right. What are you gonna do? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=354.14000000000004s)]
*  And that that is actually also reflected in this CNN poll because they asked name the Democratic leader [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=355.3s)]
*  You feel best reflects the core values of the party and this is among Democratic aligned adults [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=361.84s)]
*  the largest [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=368.52s)]
*  recipient of votes was no one [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=370.0s)]
*  30% said no one no one best reflects the core values of the Democrat Party [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=373.35999999999996s)]
*  The next in line with just 10% was AOC [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=379.32s)]
*  Who's just about tied with Kamala Harris at 9%? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=384.2s)]
*  Bernie Sanders at 8% these are all bad numbers. These are clearly not the party leaders if you're only getting 9 or 10% [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=388.64s)]
*  but interestingly [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=396.24s)]
*  Coming in at 4% is Barack Obama who is tied with [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=398.40000000000003s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=404.68s)]
*  Yes, Jasmine Crockett who nobody ever even heard of six months ago [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=406.44s)]
*  But is out there doing her like dancing videos and trying to be like a new version of AOC [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=411.64s)]
*  But unbelievably Obama and Jasmine Crockett are tied for who best reflects the core values of the party [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=416.88s)]
*  Which which tells us what? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=423.92s)]
*  Well, I think if you look at the people you named [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=427.72s)]
*  Obviously other than Obama who's there because he was the president and Kamala who's there because she just got done being the nominee [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=431.0s)]
*  But 9% is pathetic or whatever [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=438.08s)]
*  The three people that you named AOC Bernie and Jasmine Crockett for all the intense disagreements [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=440.96s)]
*  I have with them are people who in contrast to what I just got done saying [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=446.76s)]
*  Do you actually believe in things and do you actually say the things that they believe in? [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=451.24s)]
*  And I think most of all what they're doing now is creating this kind of [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=455.72s)]
*  Perception this branding this posture like we are gonna fight Trump on everything [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=459.64s)]
*  And on some level what the Democratic Party wants what Democratic Party voters want? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=463.72s)]
*  I think this poll shows it is not just fighting with Trump [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=468.24s)]
*  But somebody who at least believes in things and that was you know [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=471.08s)]
*  Bernie's campaign in 2016 and 2020 stood for a clear affirmative agenda [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=474.56s)]
*  Which a lot of people disliked and a lot of people like but you can't deny that [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=478.96s)]
*  He did and I think that's what this is showing above all else. You've had this like faceless kind of soulless [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=482.44s)]
*  very [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=489.28s)]
*  consultant driven [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=490.36s)]
*  Set of Democratic Party leaders who are petrified of saying the wrong word going off script even a single time and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  Then you have Donald Trump just riffing every day on everything without the slightest regard [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=499.4s)]
*  For how people are gonna react to the things that he's saying and I think that that is what has made [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=504.64s)]
*  the Democratic Party, which is just like this very limp [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=509.92s)]
*  neoliberal vaguely kind of [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=514.48s)]
*  Trying to be a center-left party but never really saying much or believing in anything [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=517.44s)]
*  I think that's what you're seeing in these polls among Democratic Party voters is at least the people who are out there making a mock [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=522.0s)]
*  You know a mockery of themselves like Jasmine Crockett, which is why the media loves her at least they're saying something [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=528.04s)]
*  They don't seem super constrained [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=533.0s)]
*  They're not afraid limp is a rough word, but it I think you're right [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=535.4s)]
*  It applies that is kind of how you how you feel when you look at the Democrats today [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=539.44s)]
*  Okay, so let's get to the point that you made you're exactly right both of these polls CNN and NBC [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=543.68s)]
*  Seem to try to get at why why are the Democrats so unhappy and and it is not because team blue [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=549.36s)]
*  Refuses to compromise with Trump who has a mandate to change the country. It is not that at all [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=557.0s)]
*  The Democrats are mad about any compromise. They want their [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=563.0s)]
*  Party leaders to get in there and fight and stop Trump [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=568.6s)]
*  There's still the party there is some still some strain within it that is very very TDS afflicted [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=571.96s)]
*  This is CNN most Democratic aligned adults say the party should focus on trying to stop the GOP agenda [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=579.56s)]
*  and [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=587.76s)]
*  That's okay. So so the majority want that in [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=588.96s)]
*  Just 2017 when Trump began his first term [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=593.4s)]
*  74% of the Dems thought the Dems should work with Republicans [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=597.24s)]
*  Okay [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=602.3199999999999s)]
*  Now it's only 42% who want Dems to work with Republicans and just doing the math it must be somewhere over [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=602.8199999999999s)]
*  You know 50 58 percent who say fight stop the GOP agenda [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=609.5799999999999s)]
*  52% of Democratic aligned adults say the Democratic Party is taking the wrong direction with the Republican Party and then jumping to the NBC poll [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=616.8s)]
*  Similar numbers where they say [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=625.16s)]
*  Hold on. Here it is [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=627.76s)]
*  Okay [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=629.8s)]
*  No more compromising they say [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  Almost two-thirds of Democrats 65% say they want congressional Democrats to stick to their positions [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=634.04s)]
*  Even if that risks sacrificing sacrificing bipartisan progress [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=640.04s)]
*  Just 32% want them to make legislative compromises with Trump [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=645.04s)]
*  It was almost exactly the opposite in April of 2017 59% of Dems and they wanted to make [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=648.76s)]
*  compromises with Trump again now 65% say no no compromises which leads us to Chuck Schumer [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=656.0s)]
*  Whose behavior was somewhat ill-timed? [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=663.1999999999999s)]
*  When you when you look at these polls which came out after he announced [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=666.3599999999999s)]
*  He would vote for the continuing resolution to make sure that the government stayed open for the next six months [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=670.56s)]
*  It's really just kicking the can for a bit before they can have the real fight [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=676.24s)]
*  but in any event he and a handful eight Democrats came forward to say we'll vote through to make sure that the [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=679.36s)]
*  Government doesn't shut down and now there's actual talk of bouncing him out as party leader Glenn [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=687.16s)]
*  Yeah, I mean here's the thing you had referenced earlier the fact that a lot of Republicans under the Obama especially the second term of Obama [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=696.08s)]
*  Wanted absolutely no compromise with the Obama administration wanted nothing but pure resistance to everything that he did John Boehner when he was the house speaker [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=704.04s)]
*  Used to feel boxed in because he wanted to do deals when deals could be done [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=712.0s)]
*  But a lot of the base were were what was vehemently opposed to any attempt to work with Democrats and Obama [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=716.48s)]
*  They wanted an opposition party and on some level Democrats are now in this same position where they don't want to do deals [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=722.52s)]
*  They don't want to join hands with the Republicans and reach compromises. They just want an opposition party [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=729.9200000000001s)]
*  Think the big difference is is that if you go back and look at the Republicans in the first term of Obama the second term of [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=734.6800000000001s)]
*  Obama they had it an agenda everybody understood what Paul Ryan or [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=740.6800000000001s)]
*  Mitt Romney or John McCain what these people stood for like what their values were what their agenda was the reason why they wanted to [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=746.0400000000001s)]
*  oppose the Obama administration I go back to the fact that [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=754.44s)]
*  The Democrats have none of this [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=759.28s)]
*  They just don't have any kind of affirmative agenda and this is the thing that's different to the polling [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=761.48s)]
*  I think is so interesting between 2017 and now because ever since Trump got elected that first term [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=766.4s)]
*  Democrats and liberals have been feeding now on almost a decade of [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=771.48s)]
*  Not just Trump is has a wrong ideology or Trump has bad policies. Trump is a fascist. Trump is a Hitler figure [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=776.0s)]
*  Trump's here to end American democracy [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=783.16s)]
*  Trump is a stooge of the Kremlin and if you really start feeding on those kinds of ideas and that kind of demonization [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=785.1999999999999s)]
*  And come to believe it. I think it makes sense to feel like oh we shouldn't be cooperating with Trump [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=792.04s)]
*  The problem is is that all of the things that liberals seem to want in these polls. That's all been tried [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=798.4399999999999s)]
*  What did we hear throughout the last three to four months of the 2020 for election? [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=803.4399999999999s)]
*  Trump is a fascist Trump admires Hitler Trump is gonna end democracy [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=807.0s)]
*  Trump is a stooge of Putin these things have all been all over the place and they don't work people don't believe that about Donald Trump and [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=810.6s)]
*  That's why I think Democrats are so lost this idea that we need to attack Trump even more [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=818.48s)]
*  They have the media who has been doing that the Democratic Party has been doing that and apparently they just want to double down on [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=824.16s)]
*  The strategy that clearly isn't working for them [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=829.5600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think that the the Democrats don't necessarily I don't I can't tell but I don't think they necessarily want you to hear about orange [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=832.4s)]
*  Man bad, you know, they they don't like Republican ideals. They don't like, you know certain things that Trump is doing [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=838.92s)]
*  They do like the immigration policies the polls show that but the economy doesn't pull quite as well [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=845.62s)]
*  So they I mean, I'm sure they do want Trump [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=851.76s)]
*  Fought uncertain key things you had Elon telling Larry Kudlow that we have to take a look at entitlements [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=854.0799999999999s)]
*  That led to all sorts of meltdowns in many corners including Republican ones [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=860.04s)]
*  Anyway, I can see how they might oppose Trump's agenda real or perceived [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=864.96s)]
*  But what we hear about of Democrat leaders is so much as just orange man bad [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=869.64s)]
*  It's just okay. So what there's very little to attach to in that [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=873.6s)]
*  here's a montage of the Democrats and [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=877.6800000000001s)]
*  pundits [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=880.6800000000001s)]
*  Melting down over Chuck Schumer and by the way in Chuck Schumer's defense [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=881.76s)]
*  The reason he and some eight other Democrats decided to vote for the continuing resolution is they were worried [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=885.48s)]
*  That if the government shut down and the government workers got divvied up into essential and non-essential workers [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=892.84s)]
*  Which is what happens the essential ones have to keep working even though there's a shutdown [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=898.1600000000001s)]
*  that it would be like a like waving the red flag at the bull with Doge and Elon like [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=901.9200000000001s)]
*  Here is everybody who's essential and everybody else is not and you know [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=908.9200000000001s)]
*  That's just like putting it all on the line. Go ahead and cut the ones who are not [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=912.9200000000001s)]
*  So that was one of their main concerns, but the Democrats are so mad and so determined to fight Trump [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=916.5600000000001s)]
*  They're not accepting those rationales. Here's some of the punditry around Schumer now over the past couple days [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=921.0s)]
*  There is a deep sense of outrage and betrayal. It is a huge slap in the face [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=927.68s)]
*  I've never seen this level of volcanic anger at a Democrat ever [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=933.26s)]
*  You ever ever we want a Mitch McConnell [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=937.68s)]
*  We want somebody who's gonna stand up to this bully Chuck Schumer has radically misread the room [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=941.08s)]
*  He is the wrong man at the wrong time like Dems don't just have a messaging problem [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=946.72s)]
*  They got a leadership problem the Chuck Schumers of the world the Hakeem Jeffries. They should all step down [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=950.76s)]
*  This is a real black mark of stain on Chuck Schumer's leadership [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=955.46s)]
*  I'm pissed as he folded like a paper napkin anyone can primary him [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=959.28s)]
*  Okay, and just one more Hakeem Jeffries who's of course the Democrats leader in the house was asked on Friday [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=966.2s)]
*  Is it time to switch him out to find a new Senate leader? And here's how he answered it [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=972.56s)]
*  Is it time for new leadership in the Senate next question [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=979.34s)]
*  That's significant that he just said next question now by the next day [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=986.02s)]
*  He had softened that and stood behind Schumer [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=990.0600000000001s)]
*  But the fact that his instinct was not to support Chuck Schumer is very telling I [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  Think here's the reality though that for me at least is underpinning all of this which is and this is something that actually Donald Trump [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1000.58s)]
*  Said often and loudly in the 2016 campaign throughout 2015 in the primary and then into 2016 in the election [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1007.6999999999999s)]
*  Which is that the Republican Party establishment and the Democratic Party establishment, which is absolutely represented by people like Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1014.9799999999999s)]
*  Have a great deal in common with one another [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1024.22s)]
*  They have differences like on social issues with abortion and trans issues and some of these kind of cultural issues [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1027.18s)]
*  They definitely have differences there that make it seem like they're constantly at each other's throat [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1034.76s)]
*  But when it comes to economic policy foreign policy [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1039.04s)]
*  Their differences are really not that great Obama said that too that you know [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  The Republicans are trying to depict him as this radical and in reality the Republican Democratic Party's fight within the 40 yard line [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1047.24s)]
*  so [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1054.64s)]
*  when it comes to these demands that Chuck Schumer and Hakeem Jeffries the Democrats or whatever do more to [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1055.84s)]
*  Fight Trump and attack Trump. It seems like they just want this kind of [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1062.6799999999998s)]
*  this is sort of imagery of fighting this kind of [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1068.04s)]
*  Surface fight but there's nothing for them to really fight on now [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1072.4399999999998s)]
*  Trump won in 2016 in my view because he ran against both the Republican and the Democratic Party establishments [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1076.3999999999999s)]
*  He had to do because his main opponent in the primary was Jeb Bush the ultimate figure of the Republican establishment [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1082.6s)]
*  And he still continues to do that [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1088.1200000000001s)]
*  So there definitely are some differences Democrats have with Trump [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1090.72s)]
*  The problem is is that what are Democrats gonna pretend to stand for they can't agree on that amongst themselves [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1093.68s)]
*  They they they are very much shaped by their big donor base that has a lot of views that have a lot in common with the Republican [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1099.64s)]
*  Party establishment and I think they're just very confused about who they are and this that's the problem Megan [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1107.1200000000001s)]
*  It's like if you don't know who you are or you're afraid to say who you are [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1112.1200000000001s)]
*  You can like wave your fist in the air and fight and say you're gonna do this and that to resist but ultimately no one [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1116.0s)]
*  Really finds it convincing because you're not really fighting for anything [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1122.76s)]
*  You're just fighting for the sake of fighting and I don't think I think that's what makes the Democrats kind of pathetic right now [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1126.08s)]
*  In the eyes of all most people is that they're just afraid to stand for anything [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1132.16s)]
*  They're confused about what they stand for whose interests they serve. They really they're just a mess and that's the big problem to me [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1136.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's a turnoff and you don't want to be associated with losers like people who fought hard and fought well [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1144.8799999999999s)]
*  But loss that's one thing but people who as you say appear like limp like a limp party. That's afraid [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1149.8799999999999s)]
*  And self-flagellating it's like mmm [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1156.2s)]
*  I don't that doesn't inspire me to put on the team jersey [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1158.6799999999998s)]
*  Even if you know these these voters who are answering these polls happen to be Democrats when you look at you know [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1161.52s)]
*  They're partisan leanings in their ideology here is a man who got [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1167.9399999999998s)]
*  1% in that poll asking who the who represents our party best like who actually does stand for our values [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1172.72s)]
*  1% got this guy you might know him as the recent vice presidential ticket [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1180.3999999999999s)]
*  candidate [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1186.76s)]
*  Underneath Kamala Harris Harris Jim Walls [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1188.1599999999999s)]
*  I would argue that Democratic officials should hear the primal scream that's coming from America is do something damn it. This is wrong [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1190.6399999999999s)]
*  Okay, well [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1197.64s)]
*  Okay, but like what specifically and why is he getting 1% I [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1200.16s)]
*  Mean think about this Megan this is like these people Kamala Harris and Tim Walz [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1210.44s)]
*  Ran for president vice president as the Democratic nominee just three months ago and three months later [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1215.16s)]
*  The vice presidential candidate is getting 1% of the vote among Democrats as to who represents the party [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1221.4s)]
*  She's one point under AOC. I [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1229.84s)]
*  Really I haven't looked but I would be willing to stake a lot on the fact that [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1233.64s)]
*  when somebody becomes the [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1239.72s)]
*  Nominee of a major party even in they lose the election a few months after that if you ask people who's the face of the party [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1241.64s)]
*  A lot of people are gonna say that person because it's the obvious choice [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1247.48s)]
*  But I think Democrats do feel that loser vibe like they need to do something else or they can I think they're embarrassed about [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1250.32s)]
*  themselves in their party and they should be and [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1256.84s)]
*  Like even in this in in that clip like Tim Walz was like, you know [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1259.44s)]
*  We have to fight the primal scream people we have to fight [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1263.56s)]
*  But how and for what you know, and I think right like they they you know [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1267.64s)]
*  Originally presented Tim Walz it was like a gift to the left wing of the party like to the Bernie AOC wing [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1273.8s)]
*  but you didn't really see much of that during the campaign because [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1279.0s)]
*  Everything that Kamala Harris has always done as vice president and I think even before senators [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1283.08s)]
*  But she always accepted that one area that she really knows well, which is criminal law because of her being a prosecutor [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1287.42s)]
*  Every time she speaks she feels like she's extremely afraid of saying the wrong thing and they infuse that into Tim Walz [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1293.12s)]
*  And there's a lot of Democratic Party leaders who have that sort of hesitation when they speak and [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1299.72s)]
*  Even the ones who are now trying to say like let's fight [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1306.12s)]
*  That let's fight is an easy thing to say that's still again saying we're not Trump [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1309.04s)]
*  We have to resist what Trump is doing. But what would you be doing? [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1313.24s)]
*  you know, what do you want to see different and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1317.3999999999999s)]
*  They still seem just very petrified to say out of fear of offending [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1320.12s)]
*  Voters and donors and consultants in the media and that ultimately is a thing that not political junkies [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1324.64s)]
*  But just like ordinary citizens who pay some attention to politics, but not constantly that's the thing they feel more than anything [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1330.56s)]
*  All right, so two men sensing an opportunity and clearly maneuvering to exploit it that would be Gavin Newsom of [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1337.8s)]
*  California who's now launched this podcast where he's having on conservative stalwarts. Well Bannon says he's not a conservative [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1345.92s)]
*  He's a populist. He's an America first populist [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1352.0s)]
*  But Charlie Kirk is conservative. Those are two of his first two guests. I have to say I'm really against this [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1354.72s)]
*  Charlie's gonna be on tomorrow. I'll talk to him about it. But I just think what's happening now is [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1360.12s)]
*  He's training for 2028 against JD Vance and every conservative who goes on that podcast is helping him [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1366.24s)]
*  They're all helping him train. I don't it's like training Drago instead of Rocky. Like why are you doing that? [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1372.48s)]
*  You're training the wrong person. This person actually doesn't respect you or your ideals. You're not gonna change his mind [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1378.72s)]
*  You're not gonna change the minds of the people who listen to his show. You're just gonna help him [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1383.1200000000001s)]
*  So anyway, that's my feeling on it. But in any event, I see what he's doing. He's trying to look like he's you know, moderating toward the center [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1386.68s)]
*  He's not quite as far left. He's hearing people out. He's taking more reason positions on things like boys and girls sports and so on [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1394.42s)]
*  Okay, that's what he's doing. And then there's Chris Murphy from my adopted home state of Connecticut [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1400.16s)]
*  Who is an absolute nobody about a year ago [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1405.48s)]
*  But then he apparently [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1409.44s)]
*  Fell in love with some hard-left media [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1411.8s)]
*  Company wannabe executive who's backed by Soros [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1416.72s)]
*  And she's helping him on his social media. I don't know when their relationship started. I'm just gonna say he's still married [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1420.3999999999999s)]
*  He says he [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1427.76s)]
*  Separated from his wife in November. No one's filed for divorce [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1429.48s)]
*  And yet he's reportedly according to semaphore in this relationship with this young hot shot female media person [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1433.32s)]
*  In any event his social media presence has certainly shot up [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1440.32s)]
*  Gotten better and now he's suddenly gone from this milk toast. Oh, gee, golly gee Willikers guy to [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1445.8799999999999s)]
*  fucking bad day [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1454.74s)]
*  He would she which he said the other day tweeted out after the after the Chuck Schumer thing [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1456.3999999999999s)]
*  Let me just give you a before and after this is just November and here's a post that he made on Election Day [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1461.16s)]
*  So I have a few superstitions on Election Day [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1469.72s)]
*  One of them is that I eat lunch at the same Burger King in Torrington every single year [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1472.0400000000002s)]
*  It's worked every election so far. So I'm not stopping plus chicken fries are really really good. Oh [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1476.8000000000002s)]
*  My god, okay and now [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1484.68s)]
*  Take a look at him [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1487.2s)]
*  Which one's the real ways and if that happens we need to mobilize not thousands of Americans not tens of thousands of [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1490.04s)]
*  Americans but hundreds of thousands of Americans you will have to be out there in the streets [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1498.4s)]
*  In a way that America is maybe never seen before and the only way that [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1505.44s)]
*  Americans are going to decide to take that kind of risk is if they see their elected leaders taking risk as well [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1510.4s)]
*  Okay, the name of the woman is [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1520.04s)]
*  Tara McGowan the CEO of the left-wing network of digital media sites known as courier newsroom. She's 39 [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1522.04s)]
*  He's 51 and now [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1528.64s)]
*  his social media [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1532.0s)]
*  presence numbers and style have all changed dramatically his ex post from Friday after Schumer [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1533.56s)]
*  Caved is hey, I just got home tough fucking day going live on insta at whatever time [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1540.24s)]
*  So what do you make of it? [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1546.88s)]
*  God, it's so cringy [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1549.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean the contrast between these two things is really interesting right because Gavin Newsom is actually angering the liberal base because [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1551.0s)]
*  while you are looking at this from the perspective of like people like Charlie Kirk or or [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1558.68s)]
*  Steve Bannon, I guess he had Michael Savage. I have someone else coming on shortly in that vein that they're helping Gavin Newsom [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1564.24s)]
*  From the liberal perspective Gavin Newsom is not inviting them on to fight with them or to be confrontational with them [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1571.44s)]
*  But kind of placate them almost be friendly with them in a way that as you said is designed to show that he's like a more [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1577.56s)]
*  reasonable guy and they're [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1583.56s)]
*  Infuriated by this that I don't think Gavin Newsom [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1585.36s)]
*  He may be helping himself in terms of general election prospects, but in terms of the primary where you need like the real hardcore militants [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1588.44s)]
*  He's alienating a lot of people who just a couple months ago were very open to supporting him [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1595.48s)]
*  But I guess you know his strategy is I have to convince Democrats that [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1600.96s)]
*  Not just that I the candidate they want but that I'm the candidate that can win [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1606.28s)]
*  Whereas as you say Chris Murphy has been told like oh this the the great the approach is to go online [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1611.3200000000002s)]
*  And sound like you know a hardcore [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1618.52s)]
*  social media [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1621.64s)]
*  Fanatic and you know that Megan you see this so much like I don't know if you saw like when Chuck Schumer was doing his [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1622.88s)]
*  rounds of media stuff [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1628.92s)]
*  He has this new book out about the crisis of anti-semitism [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1630.28s)]
*  But of course like in the course of doing this book he's mostly being asked about this this controversy that he's fallen into and [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1632.92s)]
*  He'll do things like I saw this in three interviews at least where he'll be like and these guys in the White House [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1641.2s)]
*  He's bastards, and he's like oh, sorry [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1646.92s)]
*  I didn't eat that like as though he's just so enraged that he accidentally called the bastards [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1648.92s)]
*  and but he did it like three times proving that it was scripted and [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1653.48s)]
*  You know [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1657.96s)]
*  Basterds [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1659.96s)]
*  Yes, exactly I called them bastards. That's how you don't fighting and [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1661.48s)]
*  You know he had that like thing where he went and did that chant like we will win [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1666.04s)]
*  We will win with those like elderly Democratic members of Congress running him one of whom was waving his cane and [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1670.04s)]
*  you know like [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1677.32s)]
*  Like all these things that they keep asking like you know who's gonna be our liberal Joe Rogan or they see Trump using [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1680.2s)]
*  Profanity and therefore they think that they have to use profanity to to relate to the ordinary person [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1686.8400000000001s)]
*  It doesn't work like the reason Joe Rogan [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1692.0800000000002s)]
*  Became so popular is because he's so authentic [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1696.56s)]
*  He just he you know when he's open to all different things [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1700.0s)]
*  He's not a partisan [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  he's not an ideologue and the reason people like Trump is because they know that even if they don't agree with him he's never trying to [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1703.96s)]
*  deceive them or bullshit them by like [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1711.1200000000001s)]
*  Presenting a mask to them that isn't who they really are [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1713.76s)]
*  so when you have you know politicians like Kamala who suddenly change accents based on who she's speaking to or [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1717.08s)]
*  Democratic members of Congress who never used this kind of language before who now suddenly want to sound like they're social media influencers [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1723.84s)]
*  It just it's embarrassing. It's cringy. Yes, some hardcore Democrats will respond, but mostly it's just embarrassing [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1731.1599999999999s)]
*  It's totally cringy that's exactly right like I add the as the audience knows and you know [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1739.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm not a I'm not above swearing myself, but it has to be authentic to you [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1743.88s)]
*  I I come by it very honestly I come from a long line of foul-mouth people no [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1747.6000000000001s)]
*  My Nana my mom's mom she had a she's she swore like a sailor [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1753.8s)]
*  And passed it down to me and skipped a generation because my mom doesn't really do it and doesn't love when I do it either [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1757.76s)]
*  But it has to be authentic to you [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1762.52s)]
*  You know or you just sound kind of sad and pathetic and like a glomer like a wannabe [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1764.28s)]
*  There is a question of whether [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1769.92s)]
*  He if Chris Murphy is not going to be the answer to [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1772.24s)]
*  2028 and the Democrats problem, maybe he'll be the answer to the Schumer problem, which is a much easier [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1776.52s)]
*  Substitution right like Schumer's 200 years old and as you say represents this wing of the party [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1783.2s)]
*  That's really anachronistic and kind of just young people in general are over the Mitch McConnell's and the Chuck Schumers of the world [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1788.68s)]
*  Chris Murphy at least has the advantage of relative youth at 51 and this came up when he was on meet the press yesterday [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1795.2s)]
*  Here it is [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1802.2800000000002s)]
*  If your supporters responded online saying you should replace leader Schumer is that something that you would consider would you consider that role? [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1804.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, I don't think anybody's having that conversation [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1812.64s)]
*  Right now what's important is that we meet this moment and what I'm telling you is that if we [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1815.92s)]
*  Continue to observe norms if we continue to engage in business as usual [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1823.92s)]
*  This democracy could be gone. I don't think we have a year to save American democracy [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1829.52s)]
*  I think the way the president is acting [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1835.0s)]
*  using law enforcement to target dissidents [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1839.0s)]
*  Harassing TV stations and radio stations that criticize him endorsing political violence puts our democracy at immediate risk [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1842.32s)]
*  So that there's another like that's been the message for the past few days we we may not have a democracy soon [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1852.76s)]
*  Jasmine Crockett was saying to it too [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1858.9199999999998s)]
*  Like I'm not sure we're ever gonna be able to vote again [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1860.6s)]
*  Like we the Democrats need to do something drastic right now or we're gonna lose the country [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1862.96s)]
*  I mean, I don't agree with that in any way shape or form [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1868.56s)]
*  But I I actually think that message is gonna resonate with the blue base. What do you think? [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1871.16s)]
*  With a blue base. Yes. I mean first of all, I just I have to say I find it so funny when you ask a politician who's obviously [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1877.44s)]
*  extremely ambitious [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1884.28s)]
*  Oh, do you think would you be willing to step up into this and like this this promotion into this elevated? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1885.28s)]
*  Political position they have to pretend like this is not something I've been thinking about like Chris Murphy is drooling about being the Senate minority leader [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1893.28s)]
*  He goes to bed dreaming about it every night and he has to be like [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1899.64s)]
*  Something worth you're right. Because he has the two of them and I they may be an extricably late [[00:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1903.88s)]
*  But in any event, yes [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1909.0s)]
*  Here's the problem Megan is that I can show you in 2016 in 2017 in 2018 [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1911.44s)]
*  all throughout the first Trump campaign the first Trump presidency all [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1917.96s)]
*  Throughout the campaign again in 2020 and then in 2024 Democrats saying exactly these same things [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1922.72s)]
*  We're not gonna have a democracy if Trump wins in 2020. This may be the last selection we ever have if you ask Chuck Schumer [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1928.3600000000001s)]
*  What he thinks about Trump he would say exactly what Chris Murphy said there, which is like, yeah, I think Trump's an authoritarian [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1935.16s)]
*  I think he's threatening democracy Trump Chuck Schumer hasn't been saying that so [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1940.84s)]
*  This is I think the Democrats problem is this is what the base of the party wants to hear [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1945.76s)]
*  And if you want to boost your social media numbers if you want to get more cable hits [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1951.44s)]
*  You know if you want to seem like you're more influential in the party than you were previously [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1955.68s)]
*  These are the things that you have to say [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1959.28s)]
*  But in terms of actually defeating Trump and not just Trump of the Trump movement the Republican Party is led by Trump [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1961.48s)]
*  This has proven not to work people don't believe that Trump is a threat to democracy [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1968.3200000000002s)]
*  Now maybe with some of the things that they're doing that I actually do find controversial but not huge [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1973.44s)]
*  Departures from the tradition of presidents that message will resonate more with broader broader base of people, but I don't think so [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1979.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't think they will ever come to see Donald Trump as some sort of like [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1986.8000000000002s)]
*  Mussolini figure or Hitler figure or someone threatening American elections [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1991.0800000000002s)]
*  It's just not how the American people by and large perceive Trump and this is an easy message [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=1996.2s)]
*  Like he's a threat to our democracy. They've been using it for a decade though, and it's just not working [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2001.4s)]
*  I don't understand why they think it's gonna work now [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2006.16s)]
*  No, so you mentioned Joe Rogan and there has been this sort of weird panic on the left [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2009.72s)]
*  We've got to find our own Joe Rogan. Of course the irony being Joe Rogan was there Joe Rogan. He was of the left [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2014.0400000000002s)]
*  He was a Bernie supporter and they drove him out of the party with their insanity their woke [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2019.2s)]
*  Insanity the lies about kovat the crackdowns on Joe for his truths about kovat all sorts of things [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2025.3200000000002s)]
*  You know that drove a lot of us further to the right [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2031.96s)]
*  Including Rogan, but the answer to their absence now of Joe Rogan in their party does not appear to be Michelle Obama [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2035.2800000000002s)]
*  So far no [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2044.64s)]
*  she got no no percentages whatsoever as the leader of the party which is interesting because [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2047.0800000000002s)]
*  Think of all the buzz around her when we thought Joe had to step down after that June debate [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2053.32s)]
*  He's got to go could it be Kamala what she's not gonna win. What about Michelle? Oh, would she do it? [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2058.76s)]
*  She was one of the main names if not the main name [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2064.04s)]
*  mentioned but now nobody sees her as a party leader and apparently Michelle Obama does not see herself as a [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2067.48s)]
*  Party leader because when she talks about like her time in the White House [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2075.72s)]
*  Barack running it's all negative on this new podcast [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2081.24s)]
*  I mean, it's exactly what we thought that she it's very clear. She hated being first lady. She hated being in Washington [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2084.48s)]
*  She doesn't like the fact that Barack was president, but she just has nothing but negative things to say [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2090.7599999999998s)]
*  Here's just one small. It's just she doesn't like openly get you know caustic [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2095.9599999999996s)]
*  But she makes it pretty clear that this has never been a good idea in her in her mind [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2101.2s)]
*  Here's sought 15 with her and her brother Craig who's her co-host and I've gotten through eight years in the White House [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2105.74s)]
*  Without my big brother. That's another sort of [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2111.9599999999996s)]
*  Unusual aspect to our lives our relationship was this whole you know [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2115.6400000000003s)]
*  Being married to the president of the United States thing. Yeah that none of us kind of banked on [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2121.36s)]
*  I mean we we knew Barack was smart and you know ambitious [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2126.38s)]
*  But you know, I think but you you talked me into supporting his run [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2130.1800000000003s)]
*  I did and he was smart enough to know that he needed to come to you and sell you on the idea [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2135.76s)]
*  Barack came to me and he's like, you know [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2142.08s)]
*  I can't convince your sister [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2145.04s)]
*  To go along with us and I'm like, whoa, we'll go along with what is like [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2148.2000000000003s)]
*  I think I'm gonna run for president. I was like what I [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2153.06s)]
*  Convinced you to not [[00:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2156.88s)]
*  penalize [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2159.76s)]
*  Him for being really good at what he does [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2160.92s)]
*  There's a lot in there Glenn that does not sound like somebody who is in favor of his run for president [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2168.04s)]
*  Or frankly in favor of him like he was smart and ambitious [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2174.64s)]
*  Think about if that's how like that's why you thought that your spouse was gonna run for and possibly become president [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2180.04s)]
*  I mean, he's smart. He's ambitious [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2187.68s)]
*  None of what Barack Obama actually ran on right? I want to change the world [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2190.04s)]
*  I want to heal the country hope and change what like she wasn't buying it and it doesn't sound like she buys it to this [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2195.04s)]
*  day [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2201.7999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, you know I have to say there's a part of that with which I can empathize because [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2204.96s)]
*  if you run for president your entire family is subjected to [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2212.7599999999998s)]
*  immense amount of public scrutiny every aspect of your life is picked apart and [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2217.7599999999998s)]
*  Disclosed and the role of first lady is not necessarily the freest role [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2222.7599999999998s)]
*  There's expectations ends of what you're supposed to do and can't do the decorum that limit to what you can do [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2227.56s)]
*  So I'm not necessarily [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2234.68s)]
*  Going to say that I think it's outrageous that that wasn't something that she wanted for her life or expected for her life [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2237.3599999999997s)]
*  But if that's really how she feels and there's been reports for a long time that that is how she feels [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2244.08s)]
*  It has to produce a lot of resentment [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2249.04s)]
*  I mean he ended up doing what she insists she didn't want him to do and [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2251.92s)]
*  She did end up being first lady for eight years. And if that really is the kind of thing that she disliked doing [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2257.04s)]
*  You have to kind of think that there's something in her that's probably pretty angry about that [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2263.2799999999997s)]
*  You know, I also should say that she got immense benefits from having had that role [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2268.12s)]
*  She seemed at times to enjoy it [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2274.4399999999996s)]
*  I mean she was kind of very regal and and what might say queen-like and her behavior, but just as you do [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2276.2s)]
*  both of them got [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2282.8399999999997s)]
*  Extremely rich they spend most of their time on you know [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2284.9599999999996s)]
*  Richard Branson's yacht or in Martha's Vineyard at their sprawling estate or in their, you know, multi-million dollar DC townhouse [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2288.32s)]
*  so [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2296.48s)]
*  This kind of like I wasn't sure I didn't want this seems [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2297.6800000000003s)]
*  Unconvincing to me as well in a lot of ways [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2302.0800000000004s)]
*  I know and she's also out on David Geffen's yacht with Oprah and then yeah her memoir was named [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2303.76s)]
*  Becoming look how look at me [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2310.88s)]
*  Becoming with her big face on the front like okay, you know [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2313.6400000000003s)]
*  She's a little drunk on her own wine, but not on bar rocks [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2316.74s)]
*  Which is just interesting to me at this point after having been first lady twice. Thanks to him [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2320.06s)]
*  Let's face it Michelle Obama was not some star in her own right. She was a lawyer [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2325.7799999999997s)]
*  I think it's Sid Lee in Austin in Chicago [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2329.74s)]
*  Which is fine. It's fine. It's no great shakes. I've been in Chicago. I've practiced law there for many years [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2332.2599999999998s)]
*  Yeah, so it's fine. It's fine [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2338.22s)]
*  So she took her Harvard law degree and like got a job with a corporate law firm fine [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2341.54s)]
*  Would literally nobody would have known her name if that's how she had chosen to spend her life [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2346.0800000000004s)]
*  We know who she is because of him because he became president [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2350.1000000000004s)]
*  He was this unique character and had a lot of there were a lot of reasons behind his election [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2353.96s)]
*  But she still to me sounds bitter and even knowing that there are divorce rumors and you know [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2358.36s)]
*  She's not showing up for him [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2365.1600000000003s)]
*  Whether it's at the Jimmy Carter funeral or the Trump inauguration or the basketball game [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2366.58s)]
*  He just went and went to in LA when visiting their daughters and then dinner with the daughters. It was not there [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2371.42s)]
*  Here she is talking about I would if it were me I would say something nice about him. I would say like [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2377.02s)]
*  He's just so charming. It was it was meant to be he I knew he could heal the earth in the way [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2382.8199999999997s)]
*  He did there was there was only one person who could do it. It was my husband Barack Obama [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2388.02s)]
*  Then she gets on to talking a little bit about him personally and this is how that sounded slot 18 [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2392.94s)]
*  When a girlfriend comes to visit it's usually like you've got to stay for two days [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2398.1s)]
*  Because it's going to take us so much time to come to [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2404.34s)]
*  Check up now Barack. It's come in he's come out and he's like y'all still talking [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2409.3s)]
*  He'll sit down for five minutes be like our the boys in the flip side [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2413.22s)]
*  I don't understand has been right because he golfs and golfing takes as long as the first session of our [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2416.74s)]
*  You know, it takes five hours to golf. He'll golf with his buddies come back and be like, how's X? He's good [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2422.62s)]
*  It's like what y'all talk about [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2428.74s)]
*  nothing [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2431.1s)]
*  Okay, so can I just say she stole that from a comedian who's all over Instagram that that little bit is all over Instagram [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2434.22s)]
*  I forgive me [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2441.4s)]
*  I can't remember the guy's name but he does this whole bit about how he goes [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2441.82s)]
*  He goes golfing with a guy whose wife just died and he comes home and the wife's like, how's he doing fine? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2445.1s)]
*  Well, how would you well, he knows nothing right? It's like a thing [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2452.74s)]
*  So I don't even know if that's real but my point is simply that to me [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2456.1s)]
*  None of the clips because we have ten of them [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2460.7s)]
*  I'm not gonna go through all of them sound to me like a person who [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2462.66s)]
*  Looks at the husband with any sort of stars in the eyes still and it is possible [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2465.62s)]
*  It is possible decades into marriage. I can attest to that to still have stars in your eyes for your loved one [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2470.06s)]
*  Yeah, I mean me too, you know I like I [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2477.22s)]
*  First of all, like I do often want to be a little bit humble about our ability to judge a relationship from afar [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2480.5s)]
*  I mean there were certainly all kinds of speculation that the Clintons were gonna divorce the minute they got their chance and here they are [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2488.02s)]
*  you know in their mid 70s and they're still married and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2494.1000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I mean exactly. Oh, there was all kinds of you know speculation about Melania hating Trump and wouldn't even you know [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2498.1000000000004s)]
*  And the reality is like even if you do love your spouse [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2504.1000000000004s)]
*  There are times you're gonna fight with them there [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2507.38s)]
*  You're new the only reasons that you get those negative emotions is because you love them and care enough [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2509.02s)]
*  what I find weird Megan is I [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2513.78s)]
*  Can't imagine going on a podcast publicly and talking about what obviously I do think those presentments are real that she's sharing like these kind [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2517.86s)]
*  of like [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2526.94s)]
*  complaints about your husband not like, you know, you could do it in a light way in a humorous way like the differences between [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2528.1800000000003s)]
*  A husband and wife or whatever, but she seems like that is pretty I don't know pretty intimate and pretty deep about what she seems to find [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2534.5s)]
*  Unsatisfying about her her marriage to Barack Obama in a way that I don't know [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2545.1s)]
*  It just makes me uncomfortable [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2549.08s)]
*  Like that's the sort of thing that you work on with a marriage counselor or in therapy or something [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2550.14s)]
*  Why is she saying so much as you say like that's very negative? [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2555.38s)]
*  The only reason we know her is because of her husband [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2559.9s)]
*  And yeah, you're right [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2564.1s)]
*  You know [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2565.1s)]
*  I went work for a major law firm when I graduated law school on on Wall Street [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2565.2999999999997s)]
*  and you know, I left in two years because it was so soul-crushing and [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2570.18s)]
*  All of this that she's complaining about is what lifted her into [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2574.42s)]
*  This figure that she benefited from in so many ways like she writes books and they go to the New York Times bestseller list [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2578.54s)]
*  Because she was married to Barack Obama. I don't know [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2584.46s)]
*  I find that strange like you have to have a lot of [[00:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2587.2999999999997s)]
*  Negative resentment inside of you toward your husband if you start a podcast and you immediately start kind of complaining about what happens inside your marriage [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2589.7400000000002s)]
*  And blame him for it, right? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2597.38s)]
*  right that well that's to me what she [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2599.98s)]
*  embodies she's constantly negative and [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2602.98s)]
*  Full of grievance notwithstanding the enormous riches that this country has rained down on her [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2606.06s)]
*  This country has done nothing to her other than treat her as you point out like royalty [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2611.9s)]
*  Even though she said this the first time in my adult life. I'm actually proud of my country when he when he got [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2616.6600000000003s)]
*  Either nominated or elected whichever doesn't make a difference first time ever really this country where you got we went to Princeton [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2622.1400000000003s)]
*  You went to Harvard Law School. You wound up a successful lawyer [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2628.58s)]
*  He never found a way to be proud of your country before that. Okay, and ever since has been [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2632.42s)]
*  bitching about her life on the yachts and in the [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2638.1800000000003s)]
*  Multi-million dollar home in Martha's Vineyard and the homes in Hawaii and Chicago and DC and the still controlling the levers of power [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2641.8999999999996s)]
*  And going up as the star speaker at the DNC. She's still bitter check back in still bitter. Okay, we're still not over it [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2649.7799999999997s)]
*  There's no amount of money or political power or success or number of memoirs called becoming. Maybe we should just say it [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2656.8599999999997s)]
*  Beautiful stunning. That'll be the next for the follow-up. That's gonna make this woman less bitter [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2664.22s)]
*  I think it's who she is and honestly like this podcast now it's getting I don't know the second episode had [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2669.92s)]
*  14,000 views with where she had Issa Rae on there 14,000 views a couple days into it that I realize she's just getting started [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2676.28s)]
*  But that's that's embarrassing for the former first lady for the woman who was almost [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2682.88s)]
*  President being talked about is to step into the Joe Biden shoes [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2686.8s)]
*  And so something's happening [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2690.44s)]
*  I think with the Barack Obama at 4% Michelle Obama not even on the list and this podcast struggling to put real numbers on the [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2692.1800000000003s)]
*  Board. I think the Democrat Party is over the Obamas [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2698.36s)]
*  Yeah that honestly that that really struck me too, I mean I'm you know over the last I think like six years now [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2703.84s)]
*  It's kind of almost been like a conservative [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2710.44s)]
*  Paranoia that the Democratic Party was maneuvering constantly to get rid of whoever was gonna be their nominee and replace him with Michelle Obama [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2714.1600000000003s)]
*  That was in 2020 what we heard in 2024 what we heard because a lot of polls showed that she had this kind of popularity [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2721.36s)]
*  But I think it was very surface level like it's easy to be popular if you've never run for office before if you haven't really [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2727.2s)]
*  Staked out a lot of positions and haven't had to we saw that with Kamala Harris the way [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2732.8399999999997s)]
*  You know at first she seemed like she was this cultural phenomenon [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2738.04s)]
*  And then she had to say what she believed in and couldn't and it all kind of collapsed [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2740.6s)]
*  But I you know, I see it the other way [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2744.64s)]
*  It's like I could see huge numbers of people turning into Michelle Obama's podcast at the start just because oh it's something new and we're we [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2746.72s)]
*  Find this person interesting and then tailing off and she becomes less interesting the fact that it's starting with these pathetic numbers [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2754.16s)]
*  You know, I think it does illustrate what you're saying [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2763.0s)]
*  I saw a clip where she and her brother were debating whether or not a hot dog is a sandwich and trying to you know [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2765.46s)]
*  It's like and again, this is what I mean. It's like Michelle Obama lives the ultimate jet-setting life [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2771.72s)]
*  She hangs around billionaires all the time. She's at the most you know, like [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2776.92s)]
*  Ostentatious gala she's wearing, you know 50,000 and $100,000 gallons everywhere [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2782.3199999999997s)]
*  And so they're then trying to try and be relatable by talking to your brother about such a boring, you know [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2787.0s)]
*  It's a hot dog a sandwich. Wow, you think it isn't what this is the I just no one's gonna listen to this [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2792.6s)]
*  Why would they? [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2799.04s)]
*  Exactly, I'll give you one more sound bite of Michelle with brother Craig and why they wanted to do this podcast stop 14 [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2802.08s)]
*  You know, some people react like you're doing a podcast with your brother, why would you do that? I know really [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2811.9199999999996s)]
*  But our dynamic is so in my view unique [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2818.68s)]
*  I think there are plenty of siblings who have great relationships [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2823.56s)]
*  But you know, I think when we think back to where that came from we think about I think about just the physical [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2827.56s)]
*  Closeness that we had I mean we were we weren't wealthy and [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2835.8799999999997s)]
*  Dad was working class. We lived in the same apartment our whole lives and had to grow into that and as a result [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2840.64s)]
*  You and me we were we were physically close [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2847.3199999999997s)]
*  Because they lived in a small apartment you see [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2853.72s)]
*  Now this is why brother Craig is the co-host of this podcast, which let's face it. No one cares about brother Craig [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2857.24s)]
*  We don't know brother Craig if she were doing this with Barack [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2863.7s)]
*  She might actually get some numbers on the board or with one of the daughters, you know [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2866.4199999999996s)]
*  I think people are mildly interested in the daughters, but brother Craig. I'm sorry. We don't know him [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2870.3799999999997s)]
*  No, don't care that you were physically close. Whatever that means under a roof growing up [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2875.02s)]
*  I just feel like look maybe this is the new Joe Rogan thing [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2880.8199999999997s)]
*  Maybe she too like Chris Murphy dropping a fucking tough day [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2885.3999999999996s)]
*  And this is Michelle Obama trying to be like her authentic self to be the new Rogan Glenn [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2889.06s)]
*  But to me the whole thing is just evidence of you know Democrats [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2894.78s)]
*  Untethered right like not understanding the way forward and just kind of throw and darts at the board [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2900.3s)]
*  I'll give you the last word before we go to break [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2906.22s)]
*  Yeah, there's nothing charismatic about Craig brother Craig [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2908.7s)]
*  Although I will say like that is why I kind of thought she was being authentic in these complaints and grievances about Barack Obama [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2911.74s)]
*  She does seem close to her brother. They she does seem to be talking to him in this way that maybe is more intimate [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2917.7s)]
*  She'd be willing to say things to him that she wouldn't be willing to say to a generalized interviewer [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2922.7s)]
*  so, I don't know maybe that's what they thought was going to be the appeal of the [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2927.62s)]
*  Podcast but it just seems very narcissistic like just these two siblings talking about themselves and their relationship [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2932.46s)]
*  To the rest of us like talk about the news talk about policy talk about something that matters to other people [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2941.46s)]
*  By the way, it's very interesting without her speech writers [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2947.06s)]
*  She's a shadow of the woman we saw on stage at the DNC and elsewhere where she gives these rousing speeches [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2949.86s)]
*  She knows how to deliver it. She pauses it right the most just the right moment when it's just her it's very flat [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2955.8s)]
*  Okay, Glenn stands by he stays with us [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2961.2400000000002s)]
*  We'll get into Mahmood Khalil on which Glenn and I disagree so that ought to be interesting and much much more the New York Times [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2963.7200000000003s)]
*  actually speaking the truth now on [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2971.42s)]
*  COVID without acknowledging all of their falsehoods on the matter for years [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2973.7000000000003s)]
*  Aren't you tired of the corporate media prioritizing certain narratives over the facts I was too [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2983.02s)]
*  And that's why we started this show to have real conversations full of tough questions to get to the truth [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2988.2000000000003s)]
*  And it's also why I want to tell you about ground news an independent app and website not at the mercy of corporate control [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2993.04s)]
*  They prioritize transparency so you can compare coverage on any issue and think for yourself instead of letting someone else think for you [[00:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=2999.4599999999996s)]
*  They even show important stories that the other side is ignoring [[00:50:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3006.8599999999997s)]
*  Go to ground news comm slash Megan to see it all in action with so many outlets suppressing conservative views and ignoring facts [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3010.62s)]
*  Ground news is more important than ever track all of your most trusted independent sources there [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3017.62s)]
*  So you never miss out on the story shaping our world right now [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3022.04s)]
*  You can get 40% off their vantage plan knocking the price down to just five bucks a month go to ground news comm slash Megan [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3025.46s)]
*  That's g r o u n d news com slash Megan to invest in your ability to think critically about the news [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3031.82s)]
*  So a lot going on we just sort of covered the Dems on team red and what Donald Trump is doing the most recent [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3039.54s)]
*  Legal controversy is not Mahmood Khalil, which we'll get to but these deportations of [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3046.9s)]
*  Alleged gang members from Venezuela so Trump and Tom Homan and [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3053.82s)]
*  Kristi Noem got some 250 or so [[00:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3060.06s)]
*  alleged gang leaders on to a plane to be deported to [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3064.54s)]
*  El Salvador because the president of El Salvador has agreed to take them [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3069.9s)]
*  We were paying him some six million dollars, and he's agreed to take these folks which most I think Americans would say cool great, too [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3074.06s)]
*  But not the not these particular people because they filed the legal challenge and said you can't deport us [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3081.82s)]
*  We are challenging your [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3088.9s)]
*  Deploying the quote alien enemies act [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3091.9s)]
*  Against us so what happened was Trump signed a proclamation to deploy this thing. It's from 1798 [[00:51:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3095.94s)]
*  It's been deployed for the first time since World War two to remove these alleged gang members [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3102.66s)]
*  It's only been used three times before to bar citizens of hostile enemy governments from the United States and only during a declared war [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3108.4s)]
*  Trump alleged that this gang is conducting irregular warfare against the US [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3116.04s)]
*  He's declared them a terrorist organization them in the court and the cartels and he's also claimed that they've conducted an invasion [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3121.7200000000003s)]
*  Against the United States and therefore says he can deport them without really doing anything [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3128.32s)]
*  You can just stick them on planes and send them out of the United States [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3133.32s)]
*  So that is what has happened then they went into court the ACLU and this group representing them democracy forward [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3135.52s)]
*  filed a lawsuit on behalf of these alleged gang members at 2 a.m. On Saturday and [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3142.84s)]
*  Saying you can't do this. You don't have the authority and a judge this judge [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3149.04s)]
*  James Boasberg chief judge in the District of Columbia appointed by Barack Obama [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3155.04s)]
*  sided with the plaintiffs saying you [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3160.48s)]
*  Cannot do this and as he heard that there were three flights departing [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3164.44s)]
*  like at that moment or within moments to take these immigrants to [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3169.28s)]
*  El Salvador he said you you have to stop it [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3174.4s)]
*  You have to immediately halt the removals and return the flights to the United States any flights that are in the air [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3177.82s)]
*  My head is going to explode. This is so beyond the pale that he does not have this authority [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3184.12s)]
*  This is absolutely outrageous in my view and the Trump administration said I got a whole lot of for you [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3190.56s)]
*  Which is I'm giving you the Italian sign under the chin for no to put it politely [[00:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3196.96s)]
*  The flights have already left US airspace. They're an international airspace [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3202.64s)]
*  Though there's a dispute about in particular whether the third flight had in fact already left US airspace [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3207.44s)]
*  The first two look like they actually had in any event [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3213.8s)]
*  Then the president of El Salvador posted a picture of these now prisoners coming into his jail saying [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3216.8399999999997s)]
*  oopsie too late to this judge and [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3223.4s)]
*  As I review this alien enemies act Glenn there's been it's old but their Supreme Court precedent on it saying [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3227.44s)]
*  There is no right for judicial review [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3234.16s)]
*  For good reason because they do not wish the president's [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3237.12s)]
*  Powers in this particular department when it comes to wartime powers to be reviewable [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3241.06s)]
*  By a court and that the High Court said like pretty explicitly [[00:54:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3246.4199999999996s)]
*  Well, we know that that will lead to you know, some some you know [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3251.18s)]
*  Some bad decisions or some bad results. We don't care [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3256.7s)]
*  They wrote as follows the alien enemy act precludes judicial review of removal orders [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3260.4199999999996s)]
*  This is years after World War two had ended they wrote in a case such great war powers may be abused no doubt [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3266.74s)]
*  But that is a bad reason for having judges supervise their exercise [[00:54:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3272.8199999999997s)]
*  Whatever the legal formulas within which such supervision would nominally be confined [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3276.2599999999998s)]
*  Accordingly we hold that full responsibility for the just exercise of this great power may validly be left where the Congress has [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3282.2999999999997s)]
*  Constitutionally placed it on the president of the United States. Not only did this guy review what Trump did [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3289.54s)]
*  He's calling back [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3295.7799999999997s)]
*  Flights of alleged gang members to the United States to me. It's extraordinary your thoughts [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3297.74s)]
*  Okay, so there's some things I agree with in what you said in some things I don't so none of those detainees at Guantanamo [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3305.94s)]
*  ever had any [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3312.98s)]
*  Even one time right to go into court and contest the allegations against them that they were part of terrorist organizations that they have participated [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3315.06s)]
*  In al-qaeda or any attacks on anyone as it turns out a lot of them even the US government admits [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3322.3399999999997s)]
*  We're actually innocent [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3328.2999999999997s)]
*  That's why we ended up letting them go in so many cases because they actually were not terrorists [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3329.62s)]
*  They were not part of members of terrorist organizations and yet they were snatched away from their countries brought to the middle of the Atlantic Ocean [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3335.3399999999997s)]
*  put in very repressive conditions treated quite brutally and [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3342.1s)]
*  I [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3347.18s)]
*  Understand that in wartime [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3348.3799999999997s)]
*  Some of those things are going to happen you [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3350.58s)]
*  You know are gonna bomb someplace where a lot of the enemy combatants are and you're gonna end up killing a lot of [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3353.38s)]
*  Civilians and of course, you're gonna end up imprisoning some people unjustly [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3358.94s)]
*  But I think we have to be very careful for that reason about [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3362.58s)]
*  When we really declare something as a war and when we don't precisely because the powers of the government [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3365.82s)]
*  Escalate dramatically. Are we really at war with these gangs or are these gangs? [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3372.3s)]
*  More like horrific and violent criminals [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3379.5400000000004s)]
*  And I think one of the things we have to realize is that human institutions by definition are going to make mistakes and are going [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3381.94s)]
*  To err and these are not people just being deported which would be fine if they were sent back to their countries of origin [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3388.7000000000003s)]
*  They're being put into a prison that is probably five times worse than Guantanamo in El Salvador [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3394.1000000000004s)]
*  And if some of them are not actually gang members and there's no [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3400.6200000000003s)]
*  Opportunity for them to contest the charges against them [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3404.86s)]
*  You have to say that is an unjust outcome and the question is if it's not a judge who who decides [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3407.5s)]
*  When a president is acting unconstitutionally exceeding his powers under the Constitution who is it who judges that? [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3414.42s)]
*  Congress Congress would have to impeach him [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3421.46s)]
*  That's that's the way it works [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3424.1800000000003s)]
*  If the judge doesn't have the purview to step in as the Supreme Court has made it clear it they do not [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3425.46s)]
*  They do not not in this department then the remedy is impeachment against the president that's the way the separations of powers work [[00:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3430.54s)]
*  Except there were a lot of times in every Democratic presidency including Joe Biden's when conservatives went into a district court to [[00:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3438.3799999999997s)]
*  argue that Joe Biden was exceeding his powers under the Constitution like when they were [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3445.8999999999996s)]
*  Coercing big tech companies to censor American citizens. That's different [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3450.5s)]
*  That's different because this is I understand it [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3455.02s)]
*  As I understand it the reason that this was given, you know the sort of no judicial review blessing is [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3457.78s)]
*  Because it speaks to foreign policy during a time of war. So that's when the president's foreign power [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3464.86s)]
*  Foreign policy powers are at their peak and not reviewable you can't like a judge cannot review [[00:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3470.66s)]
*  President Trump saying I'm gonna bomb the Houthis or we're at war with Iran or whomever that's not reviewable by [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3477.18s)]
*  Article three judges and that like there are limits to the separations of powers and where a president can be checked and when it comes [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3484.86s)]
*  To foreign policy. He's at the apex of his independent power [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3490.54s)]
*  Right, you're absolutely right. He's at the apex. The question is is he without constraints? [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3495.06s)]
*  I mean in 2008 the Supreme Court in the Bumadini case [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3499.18s)]
*  Actually did rule that the detainees at Guantanamo had a one-time right of habeas corpus to go into a federal court and argue that their [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3503.18s)]
*  Detention was unjust even though we basically were treating that as a war the war on terror [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3511.62s)]
*  I guess what I'm saying is if all the president has to do is treat any kind of criminality or any kind of social problem and [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3515.9s)]
*  Just declares it to be a war like an actual invasion or a war [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3523.46s)]
*  I don't think this is the sort of thing that most Americans think of when we think of wars being at war or the kind [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3526.78s)]
*  of precedent that has traditionally [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3533.36s)]
*  I mean [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3535.94s)]
*  Agree with you on the term war but he's also declared it an invasion and that's really what's going on here [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3538.62s)]
*  I mean he declared this an invasion given the fact that we had between 10 and 20 million illegals come in under Joe Biden and [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3543.66s)]
*  That's I mean that's covered in the alien enemies act invasions and he's using that [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3550.82s)]
*  Declaration to say you're out and I'm not gonna cross T's and dot eyes [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3557.38s)]
*  I'm putting you on a plane and it's not like they don't know anything about these guys today. They put out the numbers [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3561.14s)]
*  261 were sent to El Salvador El Salvador 137 were deported under this act [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3566.6600000000003s)]
*  They know who these guys are they I like the government is saying these are gang members [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3574.1400000000003s)]
*  I say alleged because I have no idea but the government is saying we've done our homework [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3579.5s)]
*  Tom Homan is saying and they're one definitely illegals and two [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3583.94s)]
*  members of [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3588.6600000000003s)]
*  Criminal gangs that we've declared terrorist organizations. So there's a few things there are alleged terrorists [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3590.5800000000004s)]
*  There there's a leg they're allegedly part of this war and they're allegedly part of this invasion [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3595.78s)]
*  I just think there's no question that Trump is going to be upheld here [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3600.26s)]
*  He has the power to do this and I actually think this judge can be in serious trouble [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3603.98s)]
*  I I actually think this judge may get admonished by the DC Circuit Court of Appeals and if not by them then by the US [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3607.94s)]
*  Supreme Court I [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3614.0600000000004s)]
*  Don't necessarily disagree with your prediction about what the courts gonna do this Supreme Court is gonna do [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3616.0600000000004s)]
*  This is a Supreme Court that has given great deference to presidential power [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3621.06s)]
*  Especially when it comes to foreign policy more not just now, but as you say historically [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3624.88s)]
*  The one thing I want to quibble with though [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3629.3s)]
*  Is that I remember being told that we don't need to worry about Guantanamo because it was only the worst of the worst that [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3631.06s)]
*  We're being put there. They were all terrorists [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3637.06s)]
*  The government knew they were terrorists and it turned out a lot of the people not just a few but a lot of the people who [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3638.78s)]
*  Were put there ended up being falsely accused which is always gonna happen [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3644.42s)]
*  Now maybe we say look we don't care between [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3648.62s)]
*  You know allowing people to be in our country and just punishing them [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3651.9s)]
*  Unjustly based on false accusations. We prefer the latter but I do think you know because deportations usually which nobody objects to that's what Trump [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3657.2599999999998s)]
*  Ran on means taking these people and sending them back to their country of origin [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3665.22s)]
*  But they're not put in a prison here [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3668.46s)]
*  They're being sent to on purpose one of the most repressive prison systems in the world, which is the drug dealing and terrorism [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3670.46s)]
*  Prison in El Salvador and if they're not really gang members if they're just in the country illegally [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3676.94s)]
*  Is that a just outcome and is that an outcome that even if it's unjust we're willing to live with [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3682.22s)]
*  For the ability to solve the broader problem. I'm not that convinced. I don't like people being unjustly accused or punished [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3687.14s)]
*  Get out that's my feeling as you know [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3696.66s)]
*  But not necessarily to an El Salvador in prison [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3699.98s)]
*  Who will take you if you can go to Canada go to Canada [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3704.86s)]
*  So I just stay out of the United States [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3707.78s)]
*  That's all I care about like don't come here illegally or you could wind up on a midnight flight to El Salvador [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3709.02s)]
*  It's not gonna end well for you [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3715.1s)]
*  And if Tom Homan has reason to believe you're part of trend to Aragwa so much the worse for you [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3716.82s)]
*  like don't do anything that's gonna make Tom Homan think that because [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3722.46s)]
*  It got so out of control under Joe Biden that we're now at this point invasion [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3726.42s)]
*  Extraordinary powers flight you're gone and federal judges are losing their minds. Okay, which brings us to [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3730.9s)]
*  Mahmood Khalil so the audience I think knows my stance on this because I did a weekend podcast if not my [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3737.9s)]
*  The short stance is I believe the government has every right to deport him [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3744.86s)]
*  Outstanding the fact that he's a green card holder and married to an American which is really kind of in irrelevance [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3749.66s)]
*  Legally, but the green card is not in relevance and [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3755.1400000000003s)]
*  He's he's deportable under several different statutes. He's done a number of things that can get him deported [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3759.0600000000004s)]
*  I think some of his speech is grounds enough [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3765.94s)]
*  But he's actually behaved in a way that could get him deported you can get deported for a lot of things even when you're a green [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3768.6600000000003s)]
*  Card holder. It's a privilege. It's not a right and [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3774.0600000000004s)]
*  Trump had every right to say you're out of here and I know you disagree [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3776.7400000000002s)]
*  And you think it's a First Amendment case which I don't think so explain why you think that and and why you defend [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3781.36s)]
*  general [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3787.96s)]
*  Sure. I mean first of all, you know, I I've been defending free speech is probably my most important value [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3789.44s)]
*  Not just as a journalist but as a lawyer for 30 years [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3794.46s)]
*  I remember being inspired by what the ACLU did in Skokie, Illinois where they defended the right of [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3797.38s)]
*  American Nazi Party members to march through Skokie, which was a town of [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3802.2400000000002s)]
*  Holocaust survivors wearing Nazi uniforms [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3806.44s)]
*  Even though the lawyers who did that for Jewish lawyers and they had Jewish donors [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3808.56s)]
*  It was a very overwhelmingly Jewish group and they still defended [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3812.2s)]
*  The right of free speech of the people who are Nazis who only 30 years before had tried to exterminate Jews from the earth [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3815.04s)]
*  Because I think the principle is so important. I've seen many times people say they believe in the principle when it comes to their own [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3820.92s)]
*  Allies and then suddenly start finding ways to justify censorship by saying it's incitement or it's something else when it comes to the views [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3826.96s)]
*  They most disagree with and I think that's what is important to recognize [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3833.5s)]
*  Here is the Trump campaign the Trump administration made very clear that they intend to go after and punish in a lot of ways people who [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3836.96s)]
*  Are protesting the Israeli war in Gaza or Israel itself because the Trump administration are strong supporters of Israel [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3844.2400000000002s)]
*  So we have to recognize the people they're going after have views that the Trump administration [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3850.7200000000003s)]
*  vehemently disagrees with in the case of Bamud Khalil [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3855.6s)]
*  specifically [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3859.28s)]
*  I've heard a lot of accusations about him that he is a supporter of Hamas that he engaged in intimidation of violence [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3860.28s)]
*  There's no evidence of that. It is true that the some of the protesters at Columbia [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3866.64s)]
*  engaged in bad acts, but you can't impute those to [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3872.12s)]
*  Mamou Khalil and there was I don't know if you saw there was a there was Wall Street Journal reporting yesterday [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3875.7599999999998s)]
*  About who Khalil Khalil is and a lot of the Jewish students at Columbia who are part of these [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3880.6s)]
*  Encampments part of these protests and they did have a ton of American Jewish students as part of them [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3885.96s)]
*  I've interviewed them all stood up for Khalil and said the reason he was the mediator between [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3890.48s)]
*  Our group and the administration is because he's trusted by all sides [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3896.04s)]
*  He has defended Jewish students before if he hears an anti-semitic claim, he'll denounce it [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3900.02s)]
*  He's actually been at the Shabbat dinners [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3905.64s)]
*  I'd like to know specifically on the record what he has done [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3910.36s)]
*  That makes this claim that he's a Hamas supporter or incited harassment and violence against Jewish students [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3914.64s)]
*  Justifiable because I've looked very carefully. I don't see anything [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3920.6s)]
*  He went on CNN and said he works for you in the world, which is basically a branch of Hamas. That's one thing [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3923.8s)]
*  Megan the UNRWA was funded by the US government for decades under both political parties [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3932.2000000000003s)]
*  It's a part of the UN and I don't agree with that line with Hamas. You can't you can't deny that [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3937.04s)]
*  The I mean if you're gonna say that people who go work for the UN are now [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3944.2400000000002s)]
*  Suspect of being terrorists or whatever, you know how many [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3949.6400000000003s)]
*  Of the UNR and and of UNRWA [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3952.72s)]
*  Ties with UNRWA because it was working with Hamas post 10-7 even the Democrats. This is not a partisan position [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3956.48s)]
*  Well, Israel is not a partisan position [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3965.48s)]
*  Joe Biden fed Israel the arms and the money that they used to wage the war in Gaza [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3967.48s)]
*  Joe Biden has has long been one of the most stalwart supporters of Israel in all [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3972.44s)]
*  I agree with that [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3978.36s)]
*  But we're getting sidetracked because even though the guy worked for UNRWA, which I do believe is working for Hamas [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3980.8s)]
*  That's we can we can table that we can put that to the side [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3986.56s)]
*  I don't think there's any question this guy supports what Hamas did on 10-7 any question whatsoever. He was also [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3989.32s)]
*  First of all, he worked for UNRWA second law second of all, he referred to it as armed resistance what the Palestinians did [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=3997.7200000000003s)]
*  He said that it's on tape that we aired it on the show on Saturday [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4003.8s)]
*  That that's not arms resistance. That's [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4007.52s)]
*  Terrorism what happened on 10-7, but you don't need any of that. You like I'll give away all that what I just said [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4010.52s)]
*  Let's just look at what he did as the spokesperson for this group [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4017.76s)]
*  Columbia University [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4023.08s)]
*  apartheid I can't remember the acronym, but it's you know, the group [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4024.72s)]
*  Cu ad I think it was [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4028.8s)]
*  Divest and he served their spokesperson that was the group that took over Hamilton Hall and [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4031.2400000000002s)]
*  Engaged in the encampments on Columbia University [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4037.88s)]
*  Hamilton Hall alone had so many crimes we could spend all day talking about the number of there he was [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4040.84s)]
*  Not that we know of we don't believe he was there, but he was [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4047.48s)]
*  No, it matters when you're the spokesperson that's literally written into the immigration and the terrorism statutes if you are the spokesperson [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4051.44s)]
*  For a group that espouses or [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4059.1600000000003s)]
*  Supports terror you're out that that's all they have to prove spokesperson is enough [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4061.6800000000003s)]
*  And he was the spokesperson by every account that you hear of his behavior [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4066.0400000000004s)]
*  He was going in there daily to speak with Columbia University administrators saying this is what we need [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4070.5400000000004s)]
*  You need to divest entirely from Israel or you're gonna get more Hamilton Hall's. That's it. That's all we need to deport him [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4075.94s)]
*  Okay, let me just say this is so important about what these protests were in general and what the one at Columbia was because [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4083.24s)]
*  I've interviewed a lot of Columbia students who participated and even organized these protests once again [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4089.68s)]
*  Many of whom are Jewish many of whom are American Jews [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4094.4399999999996s)]
*  There's tons of American Jews who were vehemently opposed to the Israeli war in Gaza and who went out and protested against it [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4097.599999999999s)]
*  But a lot of the ones who show up are like Jewish voices for peace, which is as Hamas supporting [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4103.96s)]
*  They count they still count as as being Jewish and [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4109.68s)]
*  They represent the dominant Jewish voice on the issue of no, but they represent a significant [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4114.4400000000005s)]
*  I know they represent a significant minority [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4119.400000000001s)]
*  They had Shabbat dinners inside the encampment at Columbia because of how many Jewish students were there here's and Khalil would go [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4121.52s)]
*  Here's what the Wall Street Journal said Khalil is someone who would even step in front of an aggressor to protect Jewish students [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4128.8s)]
*  And it was a believer in non-violence and here's what an American Jewish woman at Columbia said I can state with full confidence that Mahmoud has [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4134.92s)]
*  Never expressed support for Hamas and she said she's an American Jewish woman who believes in the importance of Israel as a Jewish [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4141.72s)]
*  Homeman that talked about how often he would attend the Shabbat dinner inside the encampment [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4147.88s)]
*  I think like let me just say to a six-minute Glenn you're talking like inside the encampment [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4153.64s)]
*  So yes, he would go in and participate in this probably Jewish voices for peace Shabbat dinner, which again, they're hard [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4157.92s)]
*  partisan Hamas supporters [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4164.68s)]
*  While he was stopping while this group that he was affiliated with was stopping Jews from attending the buildings [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4167.32s)]
*  They wanted to attend crossing campus when they wanted to cross campus professors to like I'm sure I'm [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4173.04s)]
*  Super glad he had Shabbat dinner while he was stopping Jews from exercising their rights on the campus [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4178.96s)]
*  Did he who you have no proof that he was ever sawing Jews from? [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4184.8s)]
*  Okay, so that means like what I've spent, you know two or three years arguing with liberals by arguing that they had wildly [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4190.4800000000005s)]
*  overstated what January 6 was and had unjustly prosecuted the people who were there [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4198.400000000001s)]
*  Especially the ones who never engaged in violence and what they would tell me is what do you mean? [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4203.4400000000005s)]
*  Here are the people who are beating police officers. This was not a nonviolent protest and I would say okay [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4208.0s)]
*  Well punish the people who used violence against the police officers [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4214.0s)]
*  But you can't impute that to the entire protest. No, you're taking you're taking [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4217.88s)]
*  Talking about terror and immigration. No, you're in it. You're we're talking about apples and oranges you that's a very different thing [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4223.76s)]
*  You can't charge somebody with crime by like thought or by affiliation unless it's an actual conspiracy [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4229.4800000000005s)]
*  But we don't have to prove that he committed a crime [[01:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4235.0s)]
*  We don't have to prove that although I believe he probably did if he's the spokesperson for this group [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4237.36s)]
*  Then you could prove you could allege extortion you could allege conspiracy [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4241.96s)]
*  Now Alvin Bragg is unlikely to do that, but that doesn't mean crimes haven't been committed by this guy [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4245.96s)]
*  We'll have to see where the evidence goes [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4251.08s)]
*  They're looking into that right now, including the DOJ, but you don't have to prove a crime [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4253.32s)]
*  It's enough that he did it if he if he did these things if he acted as a spokesperson for this group that did commit [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4257.84s)]
*  crimes on the campus of Columbia [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4264.92s)]
*  He's out you can get him out under numerous provisions under immigration law for [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4267.8s)]
*  Criminality for supporting terror for espousing terror and then ultimately for the Marco Rubio secretary of state thing that says if you're a threat to foreign [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4273.44s)]
*  Policy, you're gone. That's you don't have to prove anything other than Marco Rubio reasonably believes that [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4280.8s)]
*  The Bill of Rights still restricts what Marco Rubio can do even though he's the secretary of state the Bill of Rights applies to green card [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4287.04s)]
*  Holders Supreme Court has said that for 120 years and if Joe Biden had said I'm deporting Jordan Peterson because he's expressing a lot [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4293.08s)]
*  Of dissent to my views and participating in protests against our policy and I deem him a threat to foreign policy every [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4300.32s)]
*  Conservative in the country would have said that is a threat to the Constitution to do [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4306.32s)]
*  I think the important thing here is not reasonable. I bet [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4310.08s)]
*  Reasonable about saying being the spokesperson for an on-campus terror group [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4314.599999999999s)]
*  Means you violated your terms of staying here and your green card is getting I think you're what I think you're wildly [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4319.36s)]
*  Miscarriorizing the point of this protest [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4324.96s)]
*  I remember, you know very well in 2002 people who are opposed to the US invasion of Iraq were told [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4326.48s)]
*  Oh, they were Salam Hussein support supporters and they would say no, we're not Salam Hussein supporters [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4331.5199999999995s)]
*  We just don't think the US should invade Iraq same thing [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4335.679999999999s)]
*  Now if you don't support financing Ukraine, you're you're told oh, you're a Putin supporter and you say no, I'm not a Putin supporter [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4338.4s)]
*  I just don't want the US involved in this war. That's a strong protest were about that's a strong man [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4344.4s)]
*  Because these protests were again, no one really [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4349.2s)]
*  They were not defending Hamas [[01:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4353.16s)]
*  They were [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4355.5599999999995s)]
*  Dramatizing that Columbia divest they were demanding that Columbia [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4356.5199999999995s)]
*  That doesn't mean that you know that that app they bought the the anti-israel protesters modeled themselves [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4361.24s)]
*  After the student movements in the 1980s that were against the apartheid regime [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4368.639999999999s)]
*  The main demand of which was we demand that you divest from apartheid South Africa [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4373.16s)]
*  That's what these students are demanding that we demand that is a peaceful [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4377.759999999999s)]
*  The American students [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4381.6s)]
*  The American students cannot be deported for having done that but someone here on a green card can be if they had [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4383.6s)]
*  He's the Trump is not running around trying to deport people who? [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4390.92s)]
*  Protested on behalf of the Palestinians in Dearborn, Michigan without committing crimes. He is not doing that [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4394.8s)]
*  Not yet reason this guy and he's not going to Glenn [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4401.0599999999995s)]
*  Let's be honest the reason this guy got caught in the crosshairs [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4404.28s)]
*  Is because they unleashed hell on that Columbia campus they behaved [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4407.84s)]
*  criminally his group of which he was a spokesman whom he was defending and making demands on behalf of in dealing with the [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4413.28s)]
*  University daily. That's why he's getting deported not because he's pro-palestinian [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4421.400000000001s)]
*  I've having trouble about this issue of is criminality necessary [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4429.08s)]
*  Keep accusing them of committing a crime make it hundreds of Columbia students hundreds [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4432.84s)]
*  Maybe thousands were arrested throughout 2024 when the administration would call the NYPD on them [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4437.68s)]
*  Khalil was never even arrested as part of those protestors. He was never one of the aggressors. He was the mediator [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4443.12s)]
*  He was somebody that the administration trusted that the protesters trusted to try and bridge and de-escalate [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4450.12s)]
*  That was his role to try and that's not that is not all consistent order. That is you said [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4456.4800000000005s)]
*  Yeah, no, he does look like a Hamas supporter to me. I have that I have very little doubt [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4462.36s)]
*  But I agree he does look at the thing [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4466.0199999999995s)]
*  He looks like a Hamas supporter to you, but that doesn't make him one a lot of people [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4468.2s)]
*  Here in I'm talking about the t-shirt which has some guy with the head exploding and his behavior at unra [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4473.32s)]
*  Which is basically how much an arm of Hamas just asked Joe Biden [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4480.24s)]
*  That's why we pulled our support there are there there is evidence that he's a Hamas supporter [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4483.5599999999995s)]
*  But I don't need to prove that so I there's it's pointless to spend too much time here [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4487.599999999999s)]
*  We have to deprive somebody people somebody's green card because he has schizophrenia [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4491.4s)]
*  You want to tell me? [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4495.56s)]
*  We can pull people's green cards for things like that for violating the terms of their visa [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4497.24s)]
*  We've put we say you know what you violated the terms that we gave you the permission to stay here [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4502.12s)]
*  So so it's over but we can't pull it for somebody who's the spokesperson for a group that's banging down the doors [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4506.16s)]
*  That's smashing windows with hammers. That's intimidating Jewish students on campus. That's a farce Marco Rubio can do it [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4512.2s)]
*  Pam Bondi can do it president Trump can do it [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4520.540000000001s)]
*  You can do it whether he's committed a crime or whether he hasn't whether he's just in great engaged in these behaviors [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4523.6s)]
*  And by the way, just because he wasn't charged by Alvin Bragg doesn't mean he did not commit extortion or [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4529.26s)]
*  Columbia students were arrested he was never I think it matters a great deal because if you're not then deporting him because [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4540.540000000001s)]
*  You're admitting that you're you're deporting him because of his views and the view that is most in the Trump administration [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4547.78s)]
*  gave Trump [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4555.86s)]
*  No, but there's no but these that if that's the these claims they have to be proven if you're saying [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4557.339999999999s)]
*  You're misstating a conspirator would not have been in Hamilton Hall necessarily the conspirator may have been [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4567.419999999999s)]
*  He wasn't in Hamilton Hall Megan. He was that's [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4572.9s)]
*  Already said that I've already said that I've already said that that's my understanding [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4576.94s)]
*  He was he did not he did he was not that all of them got arrested [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4580.74s)]
*  I already gave you this point. There's it's pointless for us to keep going back and forth [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4586.299999999999s)]
*  But what I'm saying is that of course the cops wouldn't have arrested him. He was the negotiator. He was the spokesperson [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4590.299999999999s)]
*  He was the one in there with Columbia saying sure is a nice university you have here [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4596.58s)]
*  Shame if anything happened to it, you could charge conspiracy [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4601.74s)]
*  You could charge extortion whether it's been done or not is irrelevant [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4605.12s)]
*  He violated the terms of his permission slip to be here and he can be deported for that alone [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4608.68s)]
*  Never mind whether he actually crossed a criminal line. I just [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4615.92s)]
*  The reason you need to turn him into a Hamas supporter is because Hamas is a designated terrorist organization [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4622.2s)]
*  And that's how you don't claim that he is deportable, but he has never been a Hamas supporter [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4628.4s)]
*  He's an opponent of the Israeli war in Gaza [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4633.4s)]
*  His argument is is that that war has been incredibly indiscriminating that it's a war crime [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4635.639999999999s)]
*  The International Criminal Court agrees with him many countries around the world agree with that view [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4640.639999999999s)]
*  He was protesting against a war not in favor of a terrorist group [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4645.4s)]
*  And that is why there you think Jewish students are in favor of Hamas. I don't know if I know a lot of Jewish opponents of Israel [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4649.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know a single one of them who think that what Hamas in October 7 is [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4656.08s)]
*  Justifiable [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4661.5s)]
*  Jewish voices for peace is almost indistinguishable [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4663.1s)]
*  It's a weird name they've chosen for themselves then if they support Hamas Jewish voice [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4666.02s)]
*  Listen Alan Dershowitz. That is an anti-war group [[01:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4670.3s)]
*  He's Alan Dershowitz goes off about this group every other day what they've done to him how they targeted him look [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4672.62s)]
*  It's don't say like oh well [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4678.42s)]
*  They're Jewish voices and they're against and they're in favor of Mahmoud Khalil if they're Jewish voices for peace [[01:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4680.42s)]
*  They're totally unpersuasive to me. They they've got a dog in this hunt [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4685.94s)]
*  We've seen that repeatedly with that group. It's fine. He doesn't I do think he's a ma Hamas supporter 100% [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4689.1s)]
*  I believe that but it's not necessary to my argument if he associates with terror if he poses a threat to the United States either [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4694.780000000001s)]
*  Or he can be deported if he endorses or espouses [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4701.620000000001s)]
*  Terrorist activity he can be deported if he violates the term of his visa [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4705.660000000001s)]
*  He can be deported or if the Secretary of State has reasonable grounds to believe that he poses a serious adverse foreign policy [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4709.860000000001s)]
*  Consequence to the United States he can be deported. He's done [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4717.58s)]
*  He's out if this is not going to work out well for him and his hopes of becoming an American citizen are over [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4720.58s)]
*  Last thing I want to say is I do think it's important to note that [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4727.14s)]
*  Support for Israel was one of the top two or three priorities of many top Trump officials [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4731.9800000000005s)]
*  They campaigned on it Mary Madeleine and other pro-israel groups give them a ton of money to make sure that that was a priority [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4736.860000000001s)]
*  I think it's a huge coincidence to believe that they just suddenly found immigration [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4742.46s)]
*  Problems and exactly the group that most opposes the policy that they most cherish and I think that's where the free speech issues come in [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4747.34s)]
*  In the meantime, I'm gonna give you a point on our earlier discussion about [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4757.66s)]
*  the trend Aragwa alleged gang members being deported because I [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4762.86s)]
*  Did ask my team like what happens to them when they go to El Salvador, which is I confess the question [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4768.58s)]
*  I had not asked myself and [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4773.54s)]
*  Here's what here's what the Associated Press is reporting that the El Salvadorian [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4776.26s)]
*  Justice minister has said that those held at this facility will never return to their communities [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4782.62s)]
*  But will only be whole held for a period of one year, but it's renewable [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4789.18s)]
*  So, you know if you're going down the lane of they may not be guilty [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4795.22s)]
*  I can see this is potentially problematic with the justice that they'll be facing on the other end [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4800.0199999999995s)]
*  But I stand by the fact that Trump had had the right to do it in any event, but I concede [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4804.58s)]
*  There's some problems there on the due process and over in El Salvador [[01:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4810.22s)]
*  What a shock. Okay, let's move on because we have problems of our own here in the United States and they relate to the New York Times [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4814.9s)]
*  in many ways, but here's today's way [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4822.22s)]
*  Unbelievably [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4826.82s)]
*  The New York Times comes out with a piece dated yesterday March 16th by opinion columnist Zainab to fecky [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4829.46s)]
*  We were badly misled about the event that changed our lives. We were badly misled [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4836.34s)]
*  Somebody online changed it to we badly misled you [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4844.94s)]
*  About the event that changed our lives and that's a much more accurate [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4850.219999999999s)]
*  Headline from the New York Times Glenn. This is so infuriating to me [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4854.62s)]
*  The whole thing is about stuff [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4861.0199999999995s)]
*  You've known your audience has known me and mine too and and most people who have been [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4864.179999999999s)]
*  Independent thinkers are certainly in price part of right-wing media people who listen to rumble. Oh, we've known this for years [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4870.58s)]
*  since [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4877.66s)]
*  2021 [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4878.66s)]
*  But here they are [[01:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4879.74s)]
*  2025 with an [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4881.78s)]
*  aha moment on the lab leak as the origin of kovat and how [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4883.98s)]
*  Those in charge miss led us just give you a couple of highlights from the piece and then let you take it [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4890.419999999999s)]
*  She starts by pointing out in 2020 when people started speculating about a lab accident being the spark behind the pandemic [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4898.54s)]
*  They were treated like kooks and cranks [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4906.139999999999s)]
*  By whom again Zaynep who is treating them like kooks and cranks could have been the New York Times anyway, okay [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4908.860000000001s)]
*  many public health officials and prominent scientists dismissed the idea as a [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4915.4400000000005s)]
*  conspiracy theory [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4920.02s)]
*  Insisting the virus had emerged from animals and when Eco Health Alliance lost a grant because it was doing this so-called gain-of-function [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4921.820000000001s)]
*  research no fewer than [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4929.02s)]
*  77 Nobel laureates and [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4931.26s)]
*  31 scientific societies lined up to defend the organization [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4933.780000000001s)]
*  So the Wuhan research was totally safe and the pandemic was definitely caused by natural transition. It certainly seemed like consensus [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4939.42s)]
*  We have since learned however that to promote the appearance of consensus some officials and scientists [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4946.26s)]
*  hid or [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4952.860000000001s)]
*  understated crucial facts miss led at least one reporter [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4954.66s)]
*  She's speaking of Don [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4960.06s)]
*  McGann who worked for the New York Times [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4962.06s)]
*  orchestrated campaigns of supposedly [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4964.580000000001s)]
*  Independent voices and even compared notes about how to hide their communications [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4967.780000000001s)]
*  The reason she wants us to know that it was probably a lab leak and that we were so grossly misled is [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4974.1s)]
*  because [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4982.3s)]
*  People need convincing that the next pandemic is only an accident away [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4984.06s)]
*  Basically now that RFKJ is in charge of HHS and she's seeing like measles and other problems that she cares about [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4990.38s)]
*  So she really really wants us to trust our public health entities again [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=4998.42s)]
*  Not him, but like the scientists and the Nobel laureates and the dr. Fauci's of the world [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5003.0599999999995s)]
*  Because they must have credibility in the wake of all these online influencers or bad faith actors [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5009.099999999999s)]
*  Who she later refers to as follows, I think she means you and me and others like us [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5016.38s)]
*  Stand by let me find it [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5025.5s)]
*  Some of the loudest proponents of the lab leak theory weren't just earnestly making inquiries [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5028.9400000000005s)]
*  They were acting in terrible faith using the debate over pandemic origins to attack legitimate [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5035.06s)]
*  Beneficial science to inflame public opinion to get attention [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5042.3s)]
*  She goes on to say these have truths and strategic deceptions [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5047.540000000001s)]
*  Made it easier for people with the worst motives to appear trustworthy [[01:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5051.860000000001s)]
*  while discrediting important institutions where many earnestly labor in the [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5057.620000000001s)]
*  Public interest my god Glenn this thing has it all you take it. I [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5063.660000000001s)]
*  I [[01:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5067.66s)]
*  Think you picked out the most important section, which is it's in that last one [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5068.86s)]
*  It's sort of an attempt to acknowledge that the people [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5073.82s)]
*  questioning and then dissenting from the pronouncements of dr. Fauci and that entire establishment he leads [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5078.38s)]
*  Ended up being correct [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5084.22s)]
*  But she still has to preserve the idea that the only trustworthy views are found in places like the New York Times not in that dirty [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5085.86s)]
*  Independent media so she has to say even though they were right [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5093.9400000000005s)]
*  They kind of were had bad motives and were trying to discredit institutions [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5097.9400000000005s)]
*  Obviously the people who discredited these institutions these scientific institutions are the people who led them and it wasn't [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5104.3s)]
*  Just that they got it wrong [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5111.34s)]
*  It's that they the whole thing you know starting all the way back in 2020 with that Lancet letter [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5112.66s)]
*  That was engineered by Peter Dazic and eco health Alliance who had a financial interest in a reputational interest in [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5118.48s)]
*  Ensuring that nobody thought it was a lab leak since he himself had money to work with we want on the very research [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5124.96s)]
*  That likely caused the leak they allowed that person to be the sort of objective source [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5131.28s)]
*  They hit his key role and that that's the letter that said anybody suggesting a lab leak is engaged in racist [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5136.34s)]
*  Disinformation and conspiracy-mongering against our Chinese colleagues and they pretended to have a certainty [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5143.28s)]
*  About the origins of the kovat virus that they knew they didn't have because internally all these people [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5149.12s)]
*  including some of the ones who signed that were saying actually I think a lab leak is more likely and [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5155.68s)]
*  Fauci convinced them all that like for the sake of science or something they have to lie to the public and that's exactly what they [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5161.4s)]
*  Did and even though I'm not gonna sit here and say I knew from the very beginning that it was a lab leak [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5168.28s)]
*  I'm not a scientist not an epidemiologist [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5173.1s)]
*  I did observe and complained about the fact that there was no [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5175.1s)]
*  Permission permission to debate these questions if you had raised the issue of a lab leak [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5179.4800000000005s)]
*  Including from Wuhan lab you would have been censored off the internet by every major big tech platform [[01:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5184.400000000001s)]
*  They didn't permit any questioning or debate about them [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5190.24s)]
*  They destroyed people's reputations and as it turns out they were the ones who were wrong and not just wrong but corruptly wrong now this [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5193.58s)]
*  particular op-ed writer [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5201.54s)]
*  Has had some instances where she was deviating from kovat orthodoxy [[01:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5203.54s)]
*  But you cannot write an op-ed like this in the New York Times without acknowledging that the leading institution [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5207.42s)]
*  Preventing this discussion destroying people's reputations based on their correct opinions was itself the New York Times and corporate media outlets like it [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6lEb1E02tI&t=5214.54s)]
