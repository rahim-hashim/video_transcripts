Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Link Lauren, host of "Spot on with Link Lauren," to discuss how the media is getting exposed for its lies about men and boys participating in women’s sports, male athlete AB Hernandez winning girls' state championships in California, how girls are losing out on gold medals and scholarships, why GOP support for gay marriage and gay adoption is declining in America, how "trans" overreach is hurting the overall gay movement, President Trump’s badass new official presidential portrait, Joe Rogan praising Trump and calling him the "final boss of f you," his approval rating on the rise, and more. Then Megyn breaks down how we now know for sure the Algerian Olympics boxer who won gold is a male, what just-released lab results reveal, whether he will be allowed to continue participating in women’s sports, how this show had the story right back in August and was attacked by the left, and more. And Stephen A. Smith, host of "The Stephen A. Smith Show," joins to discuss the unfairness of men and boys competing in women’s sports, what the statistics and results show when men and women compete, how the Dems are losing black voters after taking them for granted for years, the Dems' focus on Trump over actual solution, Tim Walz saying we need to "bully" Trump, and more.

# Left's Sports Lies Exposed, and Why Dems are Losing Black Voters, w/ Link Lauren & Stephen A. Smith
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 03, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1.84s)]
*  The issue of men and boys and women's sports [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3.36s)]
*  is back in the news just in time for Pride Month, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5.3s)]
*  which is being celebrated by Sesame Street [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=8.42s)]
*  because nothing says hello and welcome to children [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=11.22s)]
*  like celebrating the trans people. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  And then there's new reporting about the Algerian male boxer [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=17.44s)]
*  that we brought you extensive reporting on [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=21.8s)]
*  back in August of last year. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=23.68s)]
*  We're gonna do this starting at the top of our second hour [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=25.68s)]
*  when Stephen A. Smith is here. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=28.400000000000002s)]
*  But let me just tell you something. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=30.0s)]
*  You may remember, we came on camera [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=31.14s)]
*  when this controversy broke before anyone else. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=34.32s)]
*  Others came to the party, but we were there first [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=38.32s)]
*  saying this is a male, this is a biologically male boxer [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=42.0s)]
*  who's boxing in women's boxing [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=46.8s)]
*  and pummeling the hell out of women. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=49.260000000000005s)]
*  And publication after publication came after this show [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=51.42s)]
*  from The Daily Show to Media Matters [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=57.0s)]
*  calling us transphobes and bigots [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=59.4s)]
*  and saying we were wrong on the facts, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=62.16s)]
*  which is what really gets my goat. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=64.76s)]
*  You can call me names all day long. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=66.67999999999999s)]
*  It doesn't bother me, I'm used to it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=68.12s)]
*  But don't tell me I'm wrong on the facts. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=69.67999999999999s)]
*  Just ask Jake Tapper how that goes, okay? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=71.24s)]
*  We were not wrong. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=74.64s)]
*  We were out on a limb because no one else [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=76.02s)]
*  would tell the truth. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=78.2s)]
*  And we put on the reporter who had seen [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=79.4s)]
*  Emayn Khalifa's genetics test, the chromosomal test. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=83.2s)]
*  He had laid his own eyes on it. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=87.6s)]
*  And we put him on for you and he told you what he saw. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=90.08s)]
*  And still people disputed our facts [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=93.96s)]
*  saying we had it wrong. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=98.32s)]
*  Well, we didn't. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=99.52s)]
*  Yet again, we've been proven right. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=101.52s)]
*  And the so-called mainstream has been proven entirely wrong [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=104.28s)]
*  as they spewed allegations of bigotry [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=109.28s)]
*  and having incorrect facts at us. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=112.36s)]
*  The irony of it, the irony, how wrong they were [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=116.04s)]
*  and how freely they throw around those terms, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=120.60000000000001s)]
*  just to shut you up when you are reporting facts. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=123.12s)]
*  We're gonna have a full report laid out in our second hour [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=127.12s)]
*  with the sound and the reminders and we'll name names [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=130.6s)]
*  on the disgusting perpetrators of those attacks, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=133.56s)]
*  not just against us, but in general, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=136.96s)]
*  and trying to defend this male boxer [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=138.88s)]
*  who was beating the hell out of other women [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=141.08s)]
*  and stole the gold medal in the Olympic games, stole it. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=143.84s)]
*  It is happening at the Olympics [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=150.8s)]
*  and it's happening in college [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=152.92000000000002s)]
*  and it's happening at the high school level. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=155.6s)]
*  Those are the facts. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=157.72s)]
*  It was all over the news this past weekend, all over. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=160.84s)]
*  That runner, I mean, he's not really a runner. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=164.76s)]
*  He's a high jumper and a long jumper out in California. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=168.08s)]
*  He won first place in, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=171.76s)]
*  I can't remember his high jumper, long jumper, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=176.28s)]
*  but he won first place in one of them [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=177.95999999999998s)]
*  and they made the actual first place winner, the girl, [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=179.84s)]
*  share the top podium with him. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=182.72s)]
*  This was their great solution. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=185.07999999999998s)]
*  Let's just kick it off there. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=188.07999999999998s)]

*  Since President Trump's election, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=203.88s)]
*  the eyes of the nation have been on Mar-a-Lago [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=205.24s)]
*  and the free state of Florida. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=207.68s)]
*  It's a thriving, booming place. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=208.96s)]
*  South Florida is a special place [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=210.88s)]
*  because of its amazing water for boating, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=212.48000000000002s)]
*  it's swimming and fishing and drinking. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=214.64000000000001s)]
*  Today, clean water is endangered by toxic algae, algae. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=217.28s)]

*  In his first term, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=228.44s)]
*  President Trump signed a law to solve this problem [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=229.32s)]
*  with a new reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=231.6s)]
*  to keep clean, fresh water flowing constantly [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=234.44s)]
*  to South Florida. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=236.84s)]
*  President Trump said after years of rebuilding other nations, [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=238.12s)]

*  Washington can finish the job in next year's budget [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=243.12s)]
*  and keep President Trump's promise. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=245.88s)]
*  The Everglades Foundation, our advertiser, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=247.76s)]
*  says that would be good for Florida [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=250.28s)]

*  And it's not just California, it's Washington state. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=278.4s)]
*  It's actually, we have quite a few examples teed up [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=280.59999999999997s)]
*  of these boys running in the girls track meets [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=282.96s)]
*  and participating in the girls sports [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=285.71999999999997s)]
*  and this ridiculous accommodation by California [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=287.32s)]
*  to try to get out of the thumb [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=291.47999999999996s)]
*  that President Trump put down on them last Tuesday [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=292.79999999999995s)]
*  by saying, okay, if a male wins the girls race or event, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=295.32s)]
*  they're both gonna get a first place medal. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=302.4s)]
*  Everyone's a winner. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=304.52s)]
*  And they're both gonna literally have to stand [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=305.84s)]
*  atop the highest platform. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=307.96s)]
*  The girls have to share it with a fake girl [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=309.84s)]
*  like she belongs there. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=312.91999999999996s)]
*  Instead of being there alone as the clear best, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=314.12s)]
*  no one's saying at a woman's event, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=319.96s)]
*  they're the best in the world at everything. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=321.64s)]

*  they're the best. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=327.08s)]
*  You know, right now it's Egus Viatech, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=327.92s)]
*  but Coco Gough is making her way up [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=330.36s)]
*  or watching the French Open. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=332.2s)]
*  Like there's only one is the number one girl. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=333.44s)]
*  And it's a lie what's happening in California. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=337.76s)]
*  This is a bullshit accommodation, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=340.08s)]
*  which Gavin Newsom is all too happy with [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=341.48s)]
*  because somehow he thinks this is like the fairness thing [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=344.12s)]
*  that he just couldn't come up with. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=346.68s)]
*  He thought about it for two minutes, [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=347.8s)]
*  just couldn't come up with anything better. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=348.8s)]
*  And an attempt to skirt the big hand of big daddy, Trump, [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=350.72s)]
*  who is ready to rain hell down on these guys. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=354.36s)]
*  What do you make of it? [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=356.48s)]
*  Well, it's funny you brought up Iman Khalif. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=358.08000000000004s)]
*  I just remembered months ago [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=360.04s)]
*  in that whole situation happened with the boxer, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=361.76s)]
*  Taylor Lorenz of all people direct messaged me [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=364.04s)]
*  on Instagram and said, [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=366.76s)]
*  you should take your posts down because you're wrong. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=367.88s)]
*  That's not a biological man, that's fake information. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=370.20000000000005s)]
*  And I was like, Taylor, are you sure? [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=373.08000000000004s)]
*  I don't know, but I was scared of getting canceled. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=375.08000000000004s)]
*  Turns out we were right. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=377.28000000000003s)]
*  And I thought, you know, it walks like a duck, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=378.92s)]
*  talks like a duck, it looks like a man. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=380.72s)]
*  And my rule is always, you know, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=382.8s)]
*  do you have shoulders like a linebacker [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=384.40000000000003s)]
*  and an Adam's apple the size of Alabama? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=386.0s)]
*  You are probably a man, okay? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=388.08000000000004s)]
*  My eyes do not deceive me, I know a thing or two. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=390.04s)]
*  So no, that was funny that Taylor Lorenz told me [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=393.04s)]
*  to take my posts down about the boxer [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=395.08000000000004s)]
*  and that I was wrong and spreading misinformation. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  And we are always vindicated time and time again. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=399.72s)]
*  And when it comes to California and Gavin Newsom, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=403.64s)]
*  does he not remember his little podcast with Charlie Kirk [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=405.92s)]
*  when he was doing his sort of re-branding reinvention tour, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=408.72s)]
*  which lasted two minutes? [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=411.56s)]
*  And he said it was a fairness issue. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=413.0s)]
*  He said men should not be in women's sports. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=414.64s)]
*  And I questioned Gavin Newsom as a father, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=416.76s)]
*  He has daughters, he has a wife. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=419.24s)]
*  Do you want your daughter getting beat up on? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=421.16s)]
*  You wouldn't want your daughter [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=423.32s)]
*  sharing a locker room with a man. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=424.36s)]
*  These people are full of crap. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=425.76s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, it's the rules for thee, not for me. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=427.24s)]
*  There's no way these men want their daughters [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=429.6s)]
*  going through the same thing, [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=431.8s)]
*  but they're so scared of this liberal progressive mob, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=432.96000000000004s)]
*  this minority in their party that is actually just so loud [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=436.24s)]
*  that they constantly capitulate to them. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=439.12s)]
*  I think Gavin Newsom, if he wants to run in 2028, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=441.68s)]
*  he's going to have to move more to the middle. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=444.12s)]
*  Pete Buttigieg is trying to re-brand, [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=446.16s)]
*  Tim Walz is trying to re-brand, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=447.96000000000004s)]
*  but we will be here holding them to account [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=449.44s)]
*  because we remember how radical these guys are [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=451.48s)]
*  and that they would not protect women. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=453.92s)]
*  Let that be a lesson to everybody to listen to this show [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=456.56s)]
*  and not to Taylor Lorenz. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=458.84s)]
*  A lesson nobody needs. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=461.28s)]
*  Literally nobody listening to that needs that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=462.47999999999996s)]
*  This needs that. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=464.76s)]
*  Yeah, she's wrong on everything. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=466.08s)]
*  I mean, everything she writes is guided [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=467.15999999999997s)]
*  by her very strange emotional state, [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=469.2s)]
*  as opposed to a commitment to facts. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=471.91999999999996s)]
*  And I will say, look, it's even harder to stick to real facts [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=473.96s)]
*  when everybody's coming down on you as you were feeling, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=477.71999999999997s)]
*  but those who can do it will establish a name for themselves [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=480.35999999999996s)]
*  and credibility in this industry, [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=483.59999999999997s)]
*  and those who bend the knee will not. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=484.91999999999996s)]
*  Same thing happened with Tampon Tim. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=487.16s)]
*  Tampon Tim definitely signed a law saying that girls, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=489.36s)]
*  that girls and boys, all the bathrooms had to make [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=492.88000000000005s)]
*  tampons available in the Minnesota schools, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=495.76000000000005s)]
*  and they tried to deny it. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=498.28000000000003s)]
*  And the Star Tribune, which is disgustingly far left [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=499.20000000000005s)]
*  partisan hack paper, tried to say we were wrong [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=502.56s)]
*  and we weren't, we were not wrong. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=505.40000000000003s)]
*  And we showed the audience the videotape [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=507.56s)]
*  of the lawmakers having the debate. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=509.72s)]
*  The trans lawmaker out there was the biggest evidence [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=510.96000000000004s)]
*  I had for my side. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=514.44s)]
*  This person was all over the debate saying, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=515.88s)]
*  no, in the boys' rooms too, and I mean business. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=517.56s)]
*  Anyway, let's go back to what happened in California. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=521.04s)]
*  So this A.B. Hernandez, who I'm sorry, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=523.56s)]
*  like I'm sure this is somebody who's very confused, [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=527.4399999999999s)]
*  but there's something very strange about this person. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=530.8s)]
*  He looks like a boy trying to look like a girl, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=533.24s)]
*  and he wears like almost Kabuki makeup. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=537.56s)]
*  I don't know what's going on with the Kabuki makeup, right, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=540.4399999999999s)]
*  Link, you know what I'm saying? [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=543.92s)]
*  Like it's weirdly clowning. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=544.88s)]
*  It's like giraffe queen makeup at the draft meeting. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=545.72s)]
*  It's really crazy. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=547.92s)]
*  It's like super white. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=548.76s)]
*  Like this is what I joke with Doug, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=550.4399999999999s)]
*  that he's trying to psych out his tennis opponents [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=552.6s)]
*  because he never rubs in his sunscreen. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=554.68s)]
*  It's like he's trying to freak his opponents out [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=557.64s)]
*  like Kabuki, I don't know what's, like a gay shot. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=560.4s)]
*  They look whiter than I do. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=562.68s)]
*  Right, right. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=565.08s)]
*  So anyway, I don't know what the A.B. Hernandez [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=566.4s)]
*  approach here is, but I do know he's winning. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=569.44s)]
*  So he was allowed to compete at the States. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=572.12s)]
*  This is state championships. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=574.04s)]
*  He won first place in the triple jump, took home gold, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=575.8399999999999s)]
*  finishing with a jump of 42 feet and two inches. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=579.7199999999999s)]
*  The real winner, who was a girl, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=582.0s)]
*  Keira Hatcher placed 40 feet, five inches. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=583.36s)]
*  So two feet behind him. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=587.52s)]
*  I mean, that's a lot. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=589.0s)]
*  He beat her by two feet in the, sorry, I'm mixing. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=590.36s)]
*  Okay, in the triple jump, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=597.16s)]
*  Hernandez jumped 42 feet and two inches, right? [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=598.7199999999999s)]
*  And Keira Hatcher, she jumped 40 feet, five inches. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=601.92s)]
*  So she was two feet behind him. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=605.4399999999999s)]
*  And they were both forced to share the podium. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=607.5999999999999s)]
*  In the high jump, he and two actual girls [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=610.16s)]
*  all hit five feet, seven inches. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=614.3199999999999s)]
*  So those two girls, who actually did tie one another [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=616.12s)]
*  for first, had to share it with yet a third person, a boy, [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=618.92s)]
*  A.B. Hernandez, who tied them. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=622.5999999999999s)]
*  And A.B. Hernandez took second place in the long jump. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=624.8399999999999s)]
*  An actual girl did finish ahead of him. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=628.36s)]
*  Her name was Lauren Webster. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=631.36s)]
*  She was the only female to finish ahead of Hernandez [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=633.04s)]
*  in any competition in which the trans athlete [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=635.16s)]
*  competed this past weekend. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=637.92s)]
*  She was the only one. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=639.4s)]
*  And he shared the podium with the second place winner, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=642.0s)]
*  Brooke White, who didn't get to have second place [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=647.16s)]
*  on her own, but had to share it with him. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=649.36s)]
*  So he, ahead of Saturday's competition, [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=651.6800000000001s)]
*  was caught on camera by NBC4 in Los Angeles, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=653.4s)]
*  talking about how there was this rule change, [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=656.4s)]
*  where he, if he won, was gonna have to share the podium. [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=658.4s)]
*  And here's what he said. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=661.56s)]
*  It's nervous right now, you know, state finals, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=663.04s)]
*  back here again, just like, trying not to get in my head [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=665.6s)]
*  and just relax, but it's a little harder this year. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=670.1999999999999s)]
*  They should have just left it alone this year [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=673.52s)]
*  and try and fix it next year. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=675.56s)]
*  I see. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=679.72s)]
*  He should have been allowed to win everything. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=680.56s)]
*  That's the bottom line link. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=682.3199999999999s)]
*  Well, I'm happy to see more and more girls revolting. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=684.84s)]
*  I saw a video of girls walking away. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=687.44s)]
*  I think they're going to start fighting back very loudly [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=689.2s)]
*  because they have people like us in their corner. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=692.32s)]
*  They have the internet in their corner. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=694.2s)]
*  They are on the 80% of this 80-20 issue. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=695.72s)]
*  So I'm happy to see these high school girls. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=698.36s)]
*  They're going to start pushing back [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=700.36s)]
*  and it's going to become more aggressive [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=701.8800000000001s)]
*  and I will be right there with them, cheering them on. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=703.44s)]
*  But what's the hypocrisy that we're seeing right now [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=705.72s)]
*  is that Gavin Newsom and all these leftists, [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=708.0400000000001s)]
*  they're about DEI, feminism, protecting women, [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=709.9200000000001s)]
*  women supporting women, but then they're fine [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=713.0s)]
*  with girls getting beat up, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=715.1999999999999s)]
*  losing out on gold medals and scholarships. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=716.68s)]
*  And also there are girls across the country [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=718.88s)]
*  who might not be in California. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=720.88s)]
*  They might not be in a big city. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=722.0799999999999s)]
*  And for them, winning that medal is the scholarship [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=723.4s)]
*  to get out of their small town and to go off to college [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=725.9599999999999s)]
*  and to expand their worldview. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=728.3199999999999s)]
*  And when they're losing out to men, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=730.0s)]
*  they're stripping them of their future [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=731.9599999999999s)]
*  that they worked so hard for, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=733.6s)]
*  getting up at 4 a.m. every single day. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=734.76s)]
*  And then selfishly, I don't know anything about sports. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=736.88s)]
*  And every time a man is in a sports competition, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=740.0s)]
*  stealing it from a woman, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=742.3199999999999s)]
*  I have to do copious amounts of research. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=743.4s)]
*  I'm like, what is the CIF, long jump, high jump? [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=745.32s)]
*  I don't know what all this is. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=748.4s)]
*  So if they could stop putting men and women's sports, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=749.72s)]
*  because I'm having to learn all about sports [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=751.72s)]
*  when I know nothing, okay? [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=754.12s)]
*  Can you please stop? [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=755.36s)]
*  Just having to learn about sports takes a lot. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=756.2s)]
*  Never try to track who's female, who's male, [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=758.48s)]
*  or in the Olympic boxer, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=761.76s)]
*  who's got which chromosomes exactly [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=763.52s)]
*  and what happened to them. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=765.48s)]
*  I have a packet in front of me in preparation for today. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=767.2s)]
*  This all happened over the past weekend. [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=770.72s)]
*  We had examples of this in California, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=772.28s)]
*  in Washington state, in Oregon, in Minnesota. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=774.52s)]
*  I could go on. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=778.68s)]
*  I mean, it's happening in state after state after state. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=779.52s)]
*  Again, there was a teacher at my daughter's school [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=782.24s)]
*  who just told her two weeks ago [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=784.3199999999999s)]
*  that there are only 10 of these trans athletes [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=786.4399999999999s)]
*  participating in girls sports. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=789.24s)]
*  It's a lie. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=790.72s)]
*  It's not true. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=791.76s)]
*  It's happening every week in every school [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=793.3199999999999s)]
*  in practically every city across the country. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=796.9599999999999s)]
*  Now, I wanted to spend one minute [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=799.1999999999999s)]
*  on the messaging around this AB Hernandez [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=801.36s)]
*  because his mother came out [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=803.28s)]
*  and of course cloaks her son in glory, [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=806.64s)]
*  doesn't acknowledge that he's cheating. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=808.84s)]
*  He's cheating. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=810.8000000000001s)]
*  He's got a male testosterone advantage [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=811.64s)]
*  and he's got male limbs advantage [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=814.2s)]
*  and the jumping ability and the height ability [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=816.24s)]
*  and all the advantages that your average male [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=818.76s)]
*  has over the average female. [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=820.36s)]
*  So she gives an interview. [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=822.44s)]
*  Besides me. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=823.28s)]
*  Same. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=824.12s)]
*  Well, just to every case. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=824.96s)]
*  She gives an interview to that same NBC affiliate [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=828.6s)]
*  and every single trope that the trans community [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=831.4799999999999s)]
*  offers up to justify this was offered here. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=833.64s)]
*  Listen. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=835.64s)]
*  When you see how happy this kid is being herself, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=836.8399999999999s)]
*  the first time I saw her come out dressed as a girl [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=841.56s)]
*  that she didn't have to hide it from me, [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=844.64s)]
*  I saw it in her face. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=846.8s)]
*  So this is it. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=848.12s)]
*  This is what she wants. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=850.36s)]
*  I'm gonna support it. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=851.28s)]
*  Behind AV's every move is her mother, Nadeida, [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=852.56s)]
*  who has been watching from the crowd [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=855.52s)]
*  and protecting her 16 year old daughter [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=857.24s)]
*  from nearby protestors. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=859.4s)]
*  Both on the ground and in the sky. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=861.1999999999999s)]
*  I'm not losing my child because of my stubbornness [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=863.2399999999999s)]
*  and for me being closed minded. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=866.92s)]
*  Like I rather embrace our times together [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=869.3199999999999s)]
*  even if it's been this difficult [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=872.64s)]
*  than going to a cemetery and crying [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=874.76s)]
*  because I couldn't accept something. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=877.52s)]
*  So everyone uses the female pronouns. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=881.5999999999999s)]
*  This is how you lose the argument. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=883.8s)]
*  NBC saying she's protecting her daughter. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=885.0s)]
*  If you imagine how confused the audience is out there. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=889.76s)]
*  Why is this all this hubbub about a girl [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=893.4s)]
*  running in the girls events, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=896.5600000000001s)]
*  about her daughter participating in girls sports [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=898.08s)]
*  and then just the added cherry on top is [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=901.04s)]
*  she's going to commit suicide if we don't let her do this. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=903.88s)]
*  All of you are trying to make my daughter kill herself [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=906.6800000000001s)]
*  by standing up for fairness and safety in girls sports. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=910.36s)]
*  Well, that's what the medical lobby does. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=914.32s)]
*  There are these sick doctors [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=915.92s)]
*  who tell the parents of young kids, [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=917.08s)]
*  if some of them are single digits, they're 12, 13, 14, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=919.76s)]
*  if you don't buy into your kids gender dysphoria [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=921.72s)]
*  and put them on the cross sex hormones [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=924.24s)]
*  and go through that process, [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=925.96s)]
*  they could take their own life. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=927.2s)]
*  That's kind of the go-to [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=928.32s)]
*  and we've seen it time and time again. [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=929.44s)]
*  Honestly, I think puberty is probably the best healer [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=932.08s)]
*  or panacea for gender dysphoria. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=934.84s)]
*  Let those hormones come in, go through puberty [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=937.4s)]
*  and if you're 18, 19, 20 [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=940.16s)]
*  and you still really feel like you're trans, [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=941.64s)]
*  then you're an adult, go make that decision. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=943.88s)]
*  But in this case with the mother, [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=945.92s)]
*  I feel like if the child is underage [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=947.24s)]
*  and the mom is pushing the kid to transition, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=949.04s)]
*  the kid should probably be taken from you. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=951.12s)]
*  It's sort of the opposite of the Tim Walz model. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=952.88s)]
*  If you're pushing your kid to transition [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=954.92s)]
*  and be injected with hormones, I question you as a parent [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=956.76s)]
*  and that's when I think the government [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=959.36s)]
*  should step in and protect these children [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=960.6s)]
*  because there are sick parents [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=962.44s)]
*  who are injecting their kids with hormones. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=963.84s)]
*  There are countless teenage girls getting mastectomies. [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=965.64s)]
*  I don't care what the liberals say in my comments. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=968.2s)]
*  You can look up the statistics. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=970.16s)]
*  There's no reason 16 year old girls [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=971.6s)]
*  should be getting their breasts cut off [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=973.32s)]
*  in the name of gender dysphoria. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=974.76s)]
*  So in this case, A.B. Hernandez, you are a victim [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=976.2s)]
*  and I feel sorry for you and have empathy for you [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=979.08s)]
*  and California should step in [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=981.44s)]
*  because your mom is buying into this hysteria as well [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=982.76s)]
*  and listening to the doctors [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=985.6800000000001s)]
*  who are probably liberal, progressive, socialist [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=986.96s)]
*  and pushing trans every single day. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=989.32s)]
*  Yes, and the news media is part of the problem. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=991.6800000000001s)]
*  I worked at NBC. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=996.0400000000001s)]
*  I was part of the problem while there. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=997.4000000000001s)]
*  I've talked to my audience about this. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=999.84s)]
*  It was early on in this whole thing, [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1001.72s)]
*  but frankly it was late enough [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1003.36s)]
*  that I should have known better, [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1005.76s)]
*  but the whole thing hadn't exploded in the way it has [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1007.04s)]
*  and this was back in 2018. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1009.28s)]
*  However, NBC has learned nothing. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1012.64s)]
*  They've learned nothing from the explosion [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1014.4399999999999s)]
*  of this ideology amongst children and the detransitioners [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1016.36s)]
*  and their testimonials and the data we now have [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1018.72s)]
*  on what puberty blockers and across sex hormones does [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1020.96s)]
*  to a young girls or boys fertility and sexual function. [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1024.72s)]
*  Nothing, they've paid zero attention. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1028.84s)]
*  It's all about you have to affirm or you're a bigot [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1030.96s)]
*  and they refuse to use biologically based language, [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1033.08s)]
*  pronouns and words like daughter should not have been [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1039.1999999999998s)]
*  in that NBC news piece. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1042.1599999999999s)]
*  And there was a great example of fighting back [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1043.6799999999998s)]
*  against this on CNN over the weekend. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1046.1999999999998s)]
*  It happened on Friday. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1048.3999999999999s)]
*  It circulated on X over the weekend. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1049.6399999999999s)]
*  It was attorney Julie Hamill [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1051.6s)]
*  who confronted far left activist Brianna Keillor [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1054.1999999999998s)]
*  who poses as a neutral news anchor, [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1058.12s)]
*  but is really just a partisan hack. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1060.48s)]
*  And Julie Hamill in like sort of stone cold fashion [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1063.24s)]
*  just called out Brianna Keillor's nonsense [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1068.68s)]
*  and a factual discussions. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1072.96s)]
*  Here's a clip. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1075.48s)]
*  What would make this fair for her to compete [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1077.56s)]
*  for those who are competing against her? [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1082.24s)]
*  What would that kind of structure in competition look like? [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1084.52s)]
*  Who is her? [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1090.48s)]
*  AB, AB. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1092.36s)]
*  Okay, AB Hernandez is a male who identifies as a female. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1096.24s)]
*  What would be fair is to have Hernandez competing [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1100.2s)]
*  in the male category. [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1103.8799999999999s)]
*  It is not fair to the females competing [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1105.16s)]
*  to have to compete with a male. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1107.92s)]
*  That's how it's done. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1112.8s)]
*  Yes, that's so us too. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1114.8s)]
*  That's so us too. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1117.24s)]
*  You know what's funny is I actually got an email [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1119.6s)]
*  I'm remembering now from Media Matters. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1121.36s)]
*  Apparently they're upset because last time I was [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1123.4399999999998s)]
*  on your show, we referred to Dylan Mulvaney as a he [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1125.6399999999999s)]
*  or something and so they're mad at me, [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1128.48s)]
*  like Lauren and Megan Kelly. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1130.28s)]
*  Yeah, something like that. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1131.76s)]
*  And so why are we getting raked over the coals [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1132.84s)]
*  for using biological pronouns? [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1135.1999999999998s)]
*  Also, I'm gonna say it and I get attacked for saying it. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1136.84s)]
*  If you're a man and you feel like you should become a woman, [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1140.04s)]
*  you have to really sit and reflect and think, [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1142.9199999999998s)]
*  am I gonna make a pretty girl? [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1145.12s)]
*  Some of these guys who transition, [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1147.8s)]
*  you gotta be metacognitive. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1149.6399999999999s)]
*  We all know what we're good at and what we're not. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1151.2399999999998s)]
*  I know I'm not a six foot two athlete. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1152.9599999999998s)]
*  Communication is my skill. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1154.6799999999998s)]
*  That is going to help you move into adulthood, [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1156.1599999999999s)]
*  figuring out who you are and what you're good at. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1158.0s)]
*  So some of these men who are like, you know what? [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1159.8799999999999s)]
*  Even though I've got shoulders like a linebacker [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1161.8799999999999s)]
*  and an Adam's apple the size of Alabama, [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1163.84s)]
*  I'm gonna transition and put on a dress and heels. [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1165.8s)]
*  Some of you aren't meant to become women. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1168.0s)]
*  I know Media Matters is gonna shit themselves [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1170.36s)]
*  over that comment, but it's true. [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1172.52s)]
*  You're not meant to be women. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1174.08s)]
*  It's just not the case. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1175.3999999999999s)]
*  No, it's like a line that was once dropped on my husband [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1177.04s)]
*  as they were talking about this trans person [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1181.12s)]
*  who is a man trying to look like a female. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1183.6799999999998s)]
*  And this person said to my husband, ugly as a man, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1185.9199999999998s)]
*  outrageous as a woman. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1190.9199999999998s)]
*  It doesn't tend to improve your appearance [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1193.8799999999999s)]
*  to go from an unattractive man into a fake woman. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1197.04s)]
*  Like that guy who keeps running around [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1200.04s)]
*  to all the restaurants and getting fake mad [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1201.3999999999999s)]
*  that they're misgendering him. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1203.76s)]
*  I mean, he looks like a professional wrestler [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1205.16s)]
*  and he shows up with this huge Adam's apple [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1207.68s)]
*  as you point out and his deep voice. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1209.6s)]
*  And he's like, it's man, it's man. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1211.12s)]
*  Okay, so back to the track and field. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1213.56s)]
*  Lily Contino, yes. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1215.24s)]
*  Is that who it is? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1217.16s)]
*  Okay, so back to the track and field. [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1218.0s)]
*  Now moving on from California to Washington state, [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1220.28s)]
*  there is for the second year in a row [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1224.56s)]
*  someone named Logan Veronica Garcia. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1226.6s)]
*  Okay. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1230.68s)]
*  Veronica, there's something about it. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1232.32s)]
*  Who won the girls 400 meter race. [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1234.32s)]
*  This Garcia is 17 years old [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1237.48s)]
*  and runs for East Valley High School. [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1239.44s)]
*  His time put him ahead of the actual first place girl, [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1242.24s)]
*  Lauren Matthew by nearly a full second. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1246.68s)]
*  And he, Veronica Garcia, [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1250.56s)]
*  beat his time from last year state final by 0.05 seconds. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1254.12s)]
*  So he's been doing this for a couple of years now. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1257.8s)]
*  Oh yay. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1260.6399999999999s)]
*  He, let's see. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1262.4399999999998s)]
*  When he was announced as the winner, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1264.4399999999998s)]
*  booze rang out and the audience cheered for Lauren Matthews [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1266.6799999999998s)]
*  who they knew, Matthew, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1271.6799999999998s)]
*  who they knew was the rightful winner. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1273.28s)]
*  Let's watch a bit of that here. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1275.4399999999998s)]
*  Second place, Lauren Matthews. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1277.8799999999999s)]
*  And first place, your 2025 winner [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1280.48s)]
*  in a time of 55.70 from East Valley of Spokane, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1286.48s)]
*  Veronica Garcia. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1292.52s)]
*  Your girls 400 meter. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1301.92s)]
*  That's amazing, Link. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1306.3600000000001s)]
*  And Washington state, this isn't Texas. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1307.56s)]
*  This is not Alabama. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1311.1200000000001s)]
*  This is pretty blue. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1313.0s)]
*  And they've had it. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1315.12s)]
*  No, everyone has had it. [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1317.28s)]
*  And I know we keep saying it's an 80, 20 issue, [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1318.96s)]
*  but I know president Trump is like, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1321.04s)]
*  it's really a 95, five issue. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1322.28s)]
*  It's a 99, one issue. [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1324.28s)]
*  It's just this small radical mob [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1326.12s)]
*  that's constantly being pushed on us. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1328.96s)]
*  And I really feel like from the far left, [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1330.72s)]
*  I'm not gonna lump everybody on the left into this category. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1332.6s)]
*  They're incredible Democrats who may be watching this, [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1335.68s)]
*  but there seems to be this sort of systemic erasure [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1337.9199999999998s)]
*  of the nuclear family, of family values, [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1340.72s)]
*  of women's rights, women's spaces. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1344.16s)]
*  And this was supposed to be the party of women's rights. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1346.2s)]
*  And now they're perfectly fine with men coming in [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1348.3200000000002s)]
*  and stealing all their gold medals and trophies. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1350.24s)]
*  So I am glad people are booing. [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1352.0s)]
*  They need to get more aggressive and get out there [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1353.72s)]
*  and fight back and fight back and fight back. [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1356.0400000000002s)]
*  I also think the Democrats are just gonna continue losing [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1358.28s)]
*  if they come down on the side of the 20% of these 80, 20 [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1361.2s)]
*  issues and all of the insanity. [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1364.4s)]
*  Okay, one more for you here. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1367.1200000000001s)]
*  Oregon, in Oregon. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1369.3600000000001s)]
*  I mean, remember this teacher at my school said- [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1371.16s)]
*  It's only happened 10, just 10. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1374.04s)]
*  Oh, really? [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1375.6799999999998s)]
*  I mean, like this is, we're going through multiple, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1376.52s)]
*  just this past weekend, just in a couple of states, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1378.28s)]
*  nevermind. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1380.48s)]
*  I think he was referring to the NCAA, [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1381.3999999999999s)]
*  whose president said, I'm only aware of 10 [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1384.1599999999999s)]
*  who are actively competing right now. [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1386.8799999999999s)]
*  Which is, yeah, exactly. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1389.04s)]
*  It's a transdemic. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1390.4399999999998s)]
*  Which we dismantled anyway, that claim about only 10 [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1393.36s)]
*  at the NCAA level as well. [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1395.52s)]
*  Okay, so this is in Oregon. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1396.9199999999998s)]
*  Female athletes there were in the state championship [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1398.8799999999999s)]
*  for track and field. [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1402.64s)]
*  And the video obtained by Fox News Digital shows [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1403.8000000000002s)]
*  two high school seniors, Reese Eckerd of Sherwood High School [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1407.92s)]
*  and Alexa Anderson of Tigard High School, [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1411.24s)]
*  stepped down from their respective spots on the podium [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1415.4s)]
*  next to the trans athlete and faced the other way. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1419.44s)]
*  Anderson had placed third, Eckerd had placed fourth. [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1423.96s)]
*  The trans athlete there had actually come in fifth, [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1427.3600000000001s)]
*  but these two girls were sick of it. [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1430.8s)]
*  They understood that there should be a rightful girl [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1432.8799999999999s)]
*  in the fifth place spot and they were not having it. [[00:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1435.8799999999999s)]
*  They did not forget the girls who got screwed over [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1439.3999999999999s)]
*  by this boy pretending here they were. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1442.44s)]
*  They hopped down, they turned their backs [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1444.1599999999999s)]
*  and then an official confronted them [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1448.28s)]
*  and gestured for them to move away. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1450.84s)]
*  They were then seen walking away, standing off to the side. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1453.2s)]
*  The one who came in fifth, taking the rightful spot [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1455.9199999999998s)]
*  of an actual girl goes by Leah Rose. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1458.6s)]
*  His real name is Zachary and he's a boy [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1461.52s)]
*  and he competed as a boy in 2023 and 2024. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1464.1599999999999s)]
*  And you know this guy was middling and probably stunk, [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1469.08s)]
*  but he wanted to compete and do better [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1474.1599999999999s)]
*  and went over to the girls [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1477.84s)]
*  and was allowed to do it immediately. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1478.6799999999998s)]
*  These two girls who stepped down from the podium said, [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1480.76s)]
*  we didn't do it out of hate. [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1482.9199999999998s)]
*  We did it because someone has to say this isn't right [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1483.84s)]
*  in order to protect the integrity and fairness [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1486.3999999999999s)]
*  of girls sports, we must stand up for what is right. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1489.28s)]
*  And just as an aside back to the Washington state example [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1492.8400000000001s)]
*  that we just went through and this Garcia, Veronica, [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1497.3600000000001s)]
*  this person said last year in June as he won [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1502.0s)]
*  in that particular competition said he was somewhat hurt [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1507.8400000000001s)]
*  that his peers did not offer him congratulations [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1512.68s)]
*  for his big win quote, I guess maybe I expected [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1516.76s)]
*  sportsmanship because I was cheering the rest of them on [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1519.92s)]
*  when they were called. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1523.28s)]
*  So I expected that to get reciprocated, but I didn't get it. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1524.48s)]
*  So he shocked, shocked Link that the girls [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1529.28s)]
*  like as we also saw there in Oregon are not more excited [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1533.08s)]
*  to lose their medals and their first place spots [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1539.0s)]
*  to these boys. [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1541.68s)]
*  Well, it's interesting. [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1543.56s)]
*  One of these guys could hack it in the men's category. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1544.44s)]
*  So they have to come over and hijack the women's category. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1547.0800000000002s)]
*  And what's also interesting is they just want to erase [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1550.0800000000002s)]
*  these women's spaces. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1553.24s)]
*  And I know I keep saying it time and time again [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1554.5600000000002s)]
*  but that's really what's happening. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1556.64s)]
*  And what used to be the LGBT movement was [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1557.96s)]
*  we want equal rights, we want equal treatment. [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1560.68s)]
*  Well, now the trans movement is we want special treatment. [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1563.4s)]
*  We wanna be able to do whatever we want whenever we want. [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1566.52s)]
*  If we identify as a guy on a Monday, [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  we're gonna identify as a girl on a Tuesday [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1571.24s)]
*  and you just have to accept that, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1573.24s)]
*  call us the right pronouns, let us into your locker rooms, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1574.6000000000001s)]
*  let us on your sports teams. [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1577.24s)]
*  What happened to equal rights? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1578.72s)]
*  It's like you give them an inch, they're gonna want 10. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1580.56s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1582.8400000000001s)]
*  That's the LGBT community. [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1583.68s)]
*  They're gonna want more and more and more. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1585.0s)]
*  And the whole gay rights movement for decades was [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1587.24s)]
*  we want gay marriage. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1589.48s)]
*  Well, 10 years ago this summer, [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1590.68s)]
*  you got the Obergefell Supreme Court decision, [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1592.2s)]
*  you got gay marriage. [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1594.4s)]
*  But then all these nonprofits like human rights campaign [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1595.56s)]
*  and hundreds of nonprofits across the country, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1598.4s)]
*  they needed a new grift to continue fundraising [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1600.56s)]
*  because their whole fundraising plan was [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1603.8799999999999s)]
*  we need to fight to get gay rights. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1605.68s)]
*  Well, now it's trans rights. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1607.48s)]
*  These are not rights, okay? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1609.0s)]
*  There are no rights in this country [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1610.8s)]
*  trans people do not have. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1612.08s)]
*  They say, Trump is transphobic, [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1613.52s)]
*  he's taking trans rights away. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1615.28s)]
*  You did not lose any rights on November 5th, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1616.72s)]
*  January 20th at the inauguration. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1619.1599999999999s)]
*  We are only saying you can't push trans onto kids. [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1621.36s)]
*  You can't just come into women's sports. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1624.24s)]
*  You can't go into girls bathrooms and locker rooms. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1626.12s)]
*  You can't expose yourself. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1628.44s)]
*  If you wanna be a normal trans adult, [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1629.52s)]
*  you can't just throw it in your throat [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1631.52s)]
*  and coats your throat, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1632.32s)]
*  come one, come all to the Halloween ball, [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1633.16s)]
*  do what you wanna do. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1634.2s)]
*  But you can't come into women's spaces [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1635.4s)]
*  and you guys constantly want special treatment [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1637.2s)]
*  and we're sick of it. [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1639.68s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1640.56s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1642.6s)]
*  And for the record, I've said this before, [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1643.56s)]
*  but I used to be much more of the mind of like, [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1645.64s)]
*  do you do you, if that's what you, I'm really not. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1649.1200000000001s)]
*  I really kind of had it. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1651.44s)]
*  I think it's very kind of creepy. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1652.4s)]
*  I don't wanna see a man dressed as a woman. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1653.72s)]
*  I'm not a dress. [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1655.48s)]
*  I'm not your fucking costume. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1656.32s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1657.56s)]

*  If you've got, no, but I'm just saying, [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1659.24s)]
*  there is like a general attitude amongst everybody. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1660.8799999999999s)]
*  Not, I'm not blaming this on you, [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1664.08s)]
*  but like the thing to say is I'm fine. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1665.84s)]
*  Like if you want, whatever you do in your own private world [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1669.24s)]
*  is your business. [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1671.24s)]
*  Like adults, go ahead if you wanna be trans. [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1672.08s)]
*  I really, I've gotta be honest. [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1674.24s)]
*  I actually do have a problem with it. [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1675.9199999999998s)]
*  I am not your costume. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1677.52s)]
*  To me, it's the same thing as black people [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1679.84s)]
*  who don't want people wearing blackface. [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1681.8s)]
*  I'm not a costume. [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1684.1599999999999s)]
*  Women are not a costume. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1686.12s)]
*  We're not a dress. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1687.6799999999998s)]
*  You can't embody what it is and means to be a woman [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1689.16s)]
*  by pulling a Dylan Mulvaney and prancing around [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1692.44s)]
*  like some overly femme bot version of women [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1696.0400000000002s)]
*  that a man dreamed up. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1700.0800000000002s)]
*  It's insulting. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1701.8400000000001s)]
*  It's demeaning. [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1703.1200000000001s)]
*  And it makes me very uncomfortable. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1704.64s)]
*  And the truth is the larger and weirder the man, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1706.24s)]
*  the more uncomfortable. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1709.0400000000002s)]
*  That's the honest truth. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1709.88s)]
*  Right, no, I was just thinking [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1712.52s)]
*  of some of the trans conservatives out there who were like, [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1713.44s)]
*  we don't care if you call us the wrong pronoun. [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1715.76s)]
*  We'll do our own thing. [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1717.68s)]
*  We just wanna blend in and be adults. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1718.68s)]
*  You guys I'm fine with, [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1720.48s)]
*  but a majority of you like Dylan Mulvaney, [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1721.48s)]
*  you came up on the internet [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1723.68s)]
*  making a mockery of the female experience. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1725.2s)]
*  Dylan Mulvaney went viral because he was like, [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1727.3600000000001s)]
*  oh, I chipped a nail. [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1729.28s)]
*  I'm a woman now. [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1730.48s)]
*  I wrote an angry email. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1731.5600000000002s)]
*  I know what it's like to be a woman. [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1732.8400000000001s)]
*  I can tell you that is certainly not the case. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1734.4s)]
*  I work with women every single day, [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1736.52s)]
*  was raised by a strong woman. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1738.1200000000001s)]
*  You're an incredibly strong woman I look up to. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1739.52s)]
*  That is not what it means to be a woman. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1741.5600000000002s)]
*  So there are folks like Dylan Mulvaney [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1743.3600000000001s)]
*  who are making a mockery of the female experience. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1744.8s)]
*  And it's unfortunate that those are the ones [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1747.0s)]
*  with millions of followers and these huge platforms. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1748.88s)]
*  Yeah, and getting like endorsement deal [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1751.44s)]
*  after endorsement deal. [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1753.08s)]
*  No, I had somebody, I don't wanna get specific [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1754.0s)]
*  because I don't mean this person ill will, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1757.44s)]
*  but this person was a, let's say provider in my life [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1759.68s)]
*  of certain services. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1764.2s)]
*  And it was a man one day, [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1766.36s)]
*  and then I went back to see him [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1769.52s)]
*  and he was dressed as a female and had quote transitioned. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1770.92s)]
*  And I was shocked. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1774.48s)]
*  I was not expecting it. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1776.0s)]
*  Nobody had warned me on his staff [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1777.36s)]
*  that I was walking into somebody who was now going to try [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1779.88s)]
*  to look like a woman, didn't, but was clearly trying. [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1782.16s)]
*  And we had a discussion about it. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1785.96s)]
*  And literally in that first discussion, [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1788.4s)]
*  he tried to tell me that he had been me too-ed [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1791.2s)]
*  in his first two weeks of being a woman [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1794.88s)]
*  that some man had quote grabbed his breast, [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1798.36s)]
*  which was non-existent. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1801.8s)]
*  I'm like, this is so ridiculous. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1803.48s)]
*  Like the glomming onto every, like, okay, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1805.48s)]
*  that too is sort of a part of the sickness, right? [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1808.72s)]
*  Like these guys who pretend they get a period, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1812.24s)]
*  these guys who pretend they've been me too-ed [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1815.64s)]
*  that they've been like sexually assaulted [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1818.16s)]
*  like because they're a woman. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1821.16s)]
*  It's just, it's so creepy. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1822.72s)]
*  And it's all part of my just, you take your own illness [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1824.88s)]
*  or whatever's going on with you, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1829.56s)]
*  you work it out with your doctor. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1830.96s)]
*  I'm not engaging. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1832.4s)]
*  I'm not supportive. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1833.52s)]
*  I'm not. [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1834.56s)]
*  I won't bully you to your face. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1836.3200000000002s)]
*  I'm not gonna see you and try to make you feel bad, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1837.16s)]
*  but I'm not participating in any way. [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1839.24s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1842.48s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm like the biggest, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1843.3200000000002s)]
*  anybody who watches me knows [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1844.88s)]
*  I'm not the biggest trans G leader. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1846.1200000000001s)]
*  I was just saying yesterday, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1848.0s)]
*  what's unfortunate with Pride month is [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1849.3200000000002s)]
*  us normal gays are being lumped in with these radical T's. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1851.3600000000001s)]
*  And we are sick of it. [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1854.92s)]
*  It's wrong. [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1855.76s)]
*  We don't wanna be lumped in. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1856.6000000000001s)]
*  And that's what I was trying to explain. [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1857.44s)]
*  It's like for decades, we just wanted gay marriage. [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1859.16s)]
*  We got gay marriage. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1861.68s)]
*  And now everybody else is ruining it [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1862.76s)]
*  for the rest of us. [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1864.92s)]
*  We were fine after that. [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1865.76s)]
*  Let us be, let us live our lives. [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1866.8000000000002s)]
*  Now it's like, we wanna be in women's bathrooms. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1868.76s)]
*  We wanna dress like women. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1870.96s)]
*  We wanna have, you know what you were saying, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1872.16s)]
*  fake periods and performative womanhood. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1873.48s)]
*  We were fine being normal. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1876.0s)]
*  And now we're all being lumped in with the LGBTQ R2D2 [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1877.44s)]
*  that we want nothing to do with, honestly. [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1881.16s)]
*  It's so true. [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1882.88s)]
*  And no one has the balls to say it. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1883.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1885.0s)]
*  I know you saw these numbers, [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1888.44s)]
*  but there was just a poll out on a Birgifell [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1890.72s)]
*  and how people are feeling about gay marriage [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1892.6s)]
*  10 years after the Supreme Court ruling. [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1895.08s)]
*  And the numbers show that Democrats are overwhelmingly [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1897.12s)]
*  in favor of it still. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1899.8799999999999s)]
*  Independence, they're exactly where they've always been, [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1901.4399999999998s)]
*  was like 74%. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1904.08s)]
*  I think the Democrats are 92% in favor. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1905.12s)]
*  And the Republicans have gone way down. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1907.12s)]
*  They were like at 55% support a few years ago, [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1910.12s)]
*  and now they're at 41%. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1912.76s)]
*  So to what do we attribute the fall [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1916.1999999999998s)]
*  in Republican support for gay marriage? [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1919.56s)]
*  So I've gotten so many messages about this [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1922.6799999999998s)]
*  from liberals saying, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1924.9599999999998s)]
*  how could you be friends with Republicans? [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1925.8799999999999s)]
*  How could you be conservative? [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1927.7199999999998s)]
*  How could you go on Megyn Kelly's show? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1928.9599999999998s)]
*  How could you like President Trump? [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1930.52s)]
*  I never look down on voters. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1932.08s)]
*  I will attack Kamala Harris. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1934.52s)]
*  I will attack public figures. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1936.0s)]
*  I am never going to look down on Republican voters. [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1938.0s)]
*  In fact, I try to understand them. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1941.0s)]
*  I do not blame them whatsoever for saying, you know what? [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1942.9199999999998s)]
*  We are a little bit tired of the LGBT stuff. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  And I think that's what you're seeing in the polls. [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1948.7199999999998s)]
*  Years ago, people were fine with it. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1950.76s)]
*  They got gay marriage. [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1952.64s)]
*  Go do what you want to do. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1953.72s)]
*  You want to get married. [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1955.04s)]
*  It was a great day for gay divorce lawyers as well, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1955.92s)]
*  the Obergefell decision. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1958.48s)]
*  But no, when you look at these polls, [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1960.04s)]
*  I think what's really coming out in the polls [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1962.24s)]
*  is that all the trans stuff is being shoved down [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1964.4s)]
*  our throats every day on social media. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1966.52s)]
*  You turn on TV and the trans voices that are the loudest [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1968.32s)]
*  are the ones with like blue hair, screaming, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1971.08s)]
*  they're shrill, they're invading women's spaces. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1973.04s)]
*  So I don't blame Republican voters for saying, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1975.2s)]
*  uh-uh, we're tired of it. [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1977.48s)]
*  Nope, nope, nope. [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1978.76s)]
*  We gave you what you wanted, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1979.72s)]
*  but now we're tired of it. [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1980.72s)]
*  So I don't blame them whatsoever. [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1981.72s)]
*  And I know that upsets a lot of liberal LGBT people. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1983.28s)]
*  They want me to be the one to come out here and say, [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1986.1200000000001s)]
*  you guys get on board with us. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1988.0s)]
*  But I think a lot of LGBT people [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1989.76s)]
*  need to do some self-reflection. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1991.88s)]
*  You have to take culpability for what you have done. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1993.72s)]
*  And the trans people out there, [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1996.2s)]
*  like Dylan Mulvaney and others, [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1997.68s)]
*  they're ruining it for the rest of us. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=1999.04s)]
*  The radicals invading women's spaces, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2000.72s)]
*  they're ruining it for the rest of us. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2002.56s)]
*  That's what's happening. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2004.2s)]
*  So if you guys can't look in the mirror [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2005.04s)]
*  and be self-reflective, I can't help you. [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2006.44s)]
*  But I do not blame the voters whatsoever [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2008.4s)]
*  for saying they're a little fatigued [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2010.32s)]
*  with all the LGBTQ plus nonsense. [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2011.96s)]
*  What do you make of, because I've seen a lot of this. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2015.24s)]
*  I mean, I have a lot of gay and lesbian friends [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2018.32s)]
*  who are married and who have kids. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2021.6s)]
*  And there has been an uptick in my anecdotal observation [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2023.6s)]
*  of opinions and messaging on the conservative side [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2028.52s)]
*  against, in particular, gay adoption. [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2032.84s)]
*  It's showing two gay men in a hospital [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2036.08s)]
*  receiving a baby born by surrogate. [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2040.2s)]
*  It may be one of the male's sperm, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2043.48s)]
*  or it may have no biological connection to the men. [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2045.8s)]
*  It can be done anyway. [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2048.8s)]
*  But a lot of conservatives who I really like and respect [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2052.12s)]
*  will circulate these videos in very harsh terms, [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2055.36s)]
*  referring to it as almost theft of a baby [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2059.12s)]
*  and the denial of a baby's right and need [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2061.96s)]
*  to be with its mother right after the baby's born. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2065.04s)]
*  I confess to you, Link, I see these videos [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2069.36s)]
*  and I'm like, oh God, because I have lots of gay men [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2071.16s)]
*  in my life who I adore who have kids. [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2075.16s)]
*  And I know they're wonderful parents. [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2077.12s)]
*  And lesbians too, who are raising wonderful children. [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2078.68s)]
*  But as a mom, I'm also like, [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2081.44s)]
*  little babies, they do need their mama, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2085.56s)]
*  they need breast milk, they need, like, I don't know. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2087.36s)]
*  I'm gonna admit to being torn. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2090.36s)]
*  But I feel like this is playing a role in these numbers. [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2092.36s)]
*  Absolutely, and what's interesting is I'm torn too. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2095.44s)]
*  And that's what I love about social media and my platform [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2097.7200000000003s)]
*  is like, I'm in my 20s and my audience can see me grow up [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2100.0800000000004s)]
*  and figure out where I stand on issues too, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2102.88s)]
*  because I'm seeing all the same videos [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2104.88s)]
*  and I'm in my head going, they're taking, [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2106.52s)]
*  like the woman's in the other room, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2108.88s)]
*  the surrogate, she just gave birth, [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2110.2400000000002s)]
*  and the baby's being rushed into the other room [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2111.84s)]
*  with these guys. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2114.4s)]
*  And I think maybe the baby does need some nourishment. [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2115.2400000000002s)]
*  It needs to latch. [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2117.76s)]
*  It might want to have that bond with the mother. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2119.04s)]
*  But then again, the guys wanna have the baby. [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2121.56s)]
*  So it's like, you're down the middle [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2123.88s)]
*  and it's really confusing. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2125.04s)]
*  But I do think there are gay guys [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2126.2s)]
*  who use their babies as props. [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2127.52s)]
*  There are a lot of gay couples, I see you have babies [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2129.16s)]
*  and they wanna dress them up and trot them out [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2131.48s)]
*  on social media, like almost, you know, a puppy [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2133.44s)]
*  or something like that. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2135.68s)]
*  That's also what makes me sick. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2136.7599999999998s)]
*  I saw a gay couple online recently, [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2138.24s)]
*  I think the guy's name was Mike Del Moro, [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2140.44s)]
*  and he's a big influencer, his partner's a big influencer, [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2142.84s)]
*  and they kept doing this like brand deal or sponsorship. [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2145.88s)]
*  And I'm not alleging anything, [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2149.04s)]
*  this is just my personal take. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2150.32s)]
*  I felt like they got a brand deal sponsorship [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2152.0s)]
*  to adopt a baby. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2154.56s)]
*  They had a surrogate and they somehow used [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2155.6400000000003s)]
*  some surrogacy service that was giving them a discount [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2158.1600000000003s)]
*  for doing an Instagram reel. [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2160.48s)]
*  And that just made me feel so sick. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2162.0s)]
*  I'm like, I think they're getting a discount on the baby [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2164.1600000000003s)]
*  because they're promoting the surrogacy service for gay men. [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2167.1200000000003s)]
*  So I'm with you too, I'm torn. [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2170.44s)]
*  Because I know my bond with my mom is so strong, [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2172.6000000000004s)]
*  but then I know gay couples who have beautiful kids [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2175.88s)]
*  that they're raising and they have a beautiful family. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2178.72s)]
*  I think if I were gonna have kids, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2181.52s)]
*  I would just wanna make sure that they're strong women [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2182.96s)]
*  in the kid's life because you need that balance. [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2186.52s)]
*  You can't just have the guys in the house all the time. [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2189.44s)]
*  They need to be exposed to other people [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2191.48s)]
*  who are interesting and strong women, [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2193.04s)]
*  and I would make sure to have that. [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2194.7999999999997s)]
*  But I'm like you, I'm figuring out [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2196.2s)]
*  where I stand on the issue. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2197.48s)]
*  Luckily, I don't have to cross that bridge anytime soon. [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2198.52s)]
*  Yes, you're still young, [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2201.56s)]
*  you have your whole life ahead of you. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2202.52s)]
*  I mean, it's interesting because a virgin fall [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2206.2s)]
*  obviously is the law of the land, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2207.8s)]
*  but those numbers are going down, down, down [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2208.96s)]
*  on the Republican side, and I do wonder [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2211.0800000000004s)]
*  whether it will result in any sort of policy change. [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2212.52s)]
*  The law is the law, the Supreme Court decision. [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2216.0800000000004s)]
*  I mean, it is what it is until it isn't. [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2218.6400000000003s)]
*  I can't say it would never be reversed [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2220.6800000000003s)]
*  because we just saw Roe versus Wade reversed. [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2222.44s)]
*  And there's a strain of conservatives [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2224.2000000000003s)]
*  who believe it was founded on the same faulty principles [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2226.04s)]
*  that Roe versus Wade was founded. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2229.7200000000003s)]
*  So it could potentially go away, [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2231.6000000000004s)]
*  though I think it's highly unlikely. [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2233.28s)]
*  Totally, if I could chime in on one last thing on this, [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2235.2400000000002s)]
*  the kids who I'm perfectly fine with being adopted, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2237.4s)]
*  there are a lot of kids who are toddlers, they're tweens, [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2239.56s)]
*  they're stuck in the foster care system, [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2242.56s)]
*  being jostled around, they have no stability, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2244.28s)]
*  they don't have a stable education system. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2246.7200000000003s)]
*  And there are affluent gay couples, right? [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2248.8s)]
*  Gay couples make a lot of money. [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2251.08s)]
*  You've got two guys in the household. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2252.52s)]
*  So if they really want a child [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2254.2000000000003s)]
*  and the kid is being pushed around to foster care systems [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2256.08s)]
*  and they have a safe home, that I'm perfectly fine with. [[00:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2258.88s)]
*  But I agree, I see the videos of these babies being taken [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2261.6400000000003s)]
*  the second they're born into the other room to the guys, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2264.6400000000003s)]
*  and I think, oh God, what about all those hormones [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2267.28s)]
*  and the connection and the umbilical cord? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2269.6000000000004s)]
*  And it just is really complicated. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2271.6800000000003s)]
*  Mm-hmm, it really is. [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2274.2400000000002s)]
*  Okay, let's switch and talk a little politics [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2275.84s)]
*  because I want to get into some news that's out there. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2278.0400000000004s)]
*  So President Trump, the White House, [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2280.76s)]
*  just unveiled his new presidential portrait. [[00:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2283.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a picture of him for 2025 America. [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2288.4s)]
*  And I'm sorry, but it's badass. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2292.0s)]
*  I love it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2294.6800000000003s)]
*  It's so good. [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2296.36s)]
*  It's unlike any other presidential portrait [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2297.52s)]
*  we've ever seen. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2299.92s)]
*  It doesn't show him in front of a flag, which is unusual. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2300.96s)]
*  For the listening audience, it's like, [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2303.84s)]
*  Trump's got maybe like a hint of a smile on his face here. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2306.0s)]
*  It's not like a big smile. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2310.96s)]
*  He's got like the serious eyebrows [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  that look almost slightly furrowed, [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2314.92s)]
*  but he doesn't look mean. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2317.44s)]
*  Like it captures so much about him [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2318.8s)]
*  where he has zero Fs to give, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2321.1600000000003s)]
*  but he's still in good humor. [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2324.68s)]
*  He's tough. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2327.2799999999997s)]
*  He's been through a lot and is still standing. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2328.3599999999997s)]
*  And he looks wiser in this photo [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2331.64s)]
*  than a lot of the other portraits would project. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2334.56s)]
*  There's something about, [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2337.6s)]
*  it's a very, very effective picture of him [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2339.08s)]
*  because it does show so many aspects of his personality. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2341.68s)]
*  What do you think of it? [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2344.9199999999996s)]
*  Well, it's interesting how life kind of runs in parallels [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2346.56s)]
*  because I remember being on your show six months ago [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2349.0s)]
*  when they unveiled the official White House portrait [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2351.48s)]
*  that morning and we came on to talk about it. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2353.7599999999998s)]
*  So it's interesting how life comes around full circle. [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2355.52s)]
*  But no, that picture was taken by Daniel Turok, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2357.9199999999996s)]
*  who's actually a good friend of mine. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2359.9199999999996s)]
*  And I've loved having a front row seat [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2361.3999999999996s)]
*  to seeing him flourish and grow. [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2363.08s)]
*  And there's so many unsung heroes behind the scenes [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2365.04s)]
*  at the White House whose names we would not know, [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2367.2799999999997s)]
*  but he always takes the most incredible pictures [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2369.56s)]
*  of President Trump. [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2372.16s)]
*  There's always been this narrative in liberal media. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2373.0s)]
*  President Trump has no internal monologue [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2375.3599999999997s)]
*  or no internal life, or if he's not engaged, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2377.4399999999996s)]
*  there's nothing going on. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2380.0s)]
*  That's certainly not the case, [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2381.24s)]
*  because when we look at these portraits, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2382.52s)]
*  you can see a man who's been through the lawfare, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2384.24s)]
*  assassination attempts, he's been through the wringer. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2387.0s)]
*  There's no one in public life [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2389.56s)]
*  who could take the hits President Trump has [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2391.4s)]
*  and still get back up with a smile on their face [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2393.36s)]
*  who's feeling jovial and jubilant and happy. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2395.64s)]
*  And that's what I felt we got from the picture. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2398.32s)]
*  And then it was a cherry on top [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2400.16s)]
*  that President Trump's hair also looked great. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2401.48s)]
*  I will say that. [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2404.0s)]
*  President Trump's hair looked great, [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2405.0s)]
*  the skin looked great, the coloring looked great. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2406.44s)]
*  So shout out to you, Daniel. [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2408.64s)]
*  This is not a topic that I planned. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2410.12s)]
*  You guys chose this topic, but the picture is incredible. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2411.68s)]
*  No, I love the picture. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2415.08s)]
*  I've never seen quite a shot like that of Trump, [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2416.52s)]
*  because it's easy to show him just looking tough guy, [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2419.24s)]
*  and it's easy to show him jovial with the YMCA. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2422.3599999999997s)]
*  He's got that side. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2425.48s)]
*  But it's not easy to capture it all in one shot. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2426.68s)]
*  They must've been very pleased when they saw that on film, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2430.7599999999998s)]
*  because even if you see it in real life, [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2434.2s)]
*  can you capture it on camera? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2435.68s)]
*  Can you actually get the moment? [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2436.7999999999997s)]
*  Is the lighting gonna work? [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2438.3599999999997s)]
*  Are his eyes gonna be open? [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2439.6s)]
*  There's so many contingencies. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2440.48s)]
*  And this one is a really beautiful, powerful photo. [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2442.04s)]
*  And to me, it hit just as this viral shot [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2445.04s)]
*  of Joe Rogan was going around. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2450.16s)]
*  Don Jr. tweeted it out on X, and it was from last week. [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2451.68s)]
*  And I'm like, this picture matches, [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2455.84s)]
*  if it had a soundbite that could play underneath it, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2459.2s)]
*  in like a virtual experience [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2463.12s)]
*  as you walk through the White House, [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2465.08s)]
*  this might be the soundbite from Joe Rogan, watch. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2466.56s)]
*  It's also like, they're like, oh, he's a crazy person. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2469.36s)]
*  Like, yeah, that's the only kind of person [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2471.6800000000003s)]
*  that would survive what you try to do to him. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2474.6000000000004s)]
*  Right. [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2477.1600000000003s)]
*  That's the only kind of guy that gets through. [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2478.0s)]
*  Like, you want a perfect person? [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2480.1600000000003s)]
*  A perfect person morally falls apart [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2481.8s)]
*  by the time they've been indicted, [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2484.48s)]
*  and they have 34 counts, felony counts. [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2487.0800000000004s)]
*  Like, your whole body is just destroyed [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2489.2400000000002s)]
*  by the stress of you possibly going to jail [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2491.44s)]
*  for the rest of your life. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2493.56s)]
*  You have to be a fucking insane person [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2494.48s)]
*  to ride that out and not look like anything even happened. [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2496.92s)]
*  Then you get shot. [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2499.8s)]
*  You get up after you got shot, [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2501.92s)]
*  you're fucking bleeding from your ear, [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2503.7200000000003s)]
*  and you go fight, fight, fight. [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2505.44s)]
*  You gotta be a crazy person to get through. [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2507.0s)]
*  He's a nightmare for anybody that's trying to rig a system. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2509.6s)]
*  Like, that guy's the nightmare. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2513.48s)]
*  He's the final boss of fuck you. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2515.2000000000003s)]
*  There it is, Link. [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2519.92s)]
*  Yes. [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2521.32s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2522.1600000000003s)]
*  No, I just feel like that picture perfectly encapsulates [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2523.7200000000003s)]
*  the final boss of F you. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2527.8s)]
*  And I've been calling this the FAFO administration, [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2528.6400000000003s)]
*  the F around and find out administration. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2531.1200000000003s)]
*  Because when you look at everybody, [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2533.52s)]
*  these are people you do not want to cross. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2535.1600000000003s)]
*  You've got Stephen Chung. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2537.1200000000003s)]
*  Does this look like a person you want to cross on a bad day? [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2538.36s)]
*  No, you've got Stephen Miller. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2541.32s)]
*  He will bite your head off. [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2542.96s)]
*  Like, this is the FAFO administration. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2543.92s)]
*  You've got Bobby Kennedy in there [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2546.08s)]
*  who wants to tear down the system and make us healthier. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2547.36s)]
*  So I couldn't be happier. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2549.6000000000004s)]
*  And that's one of the things I love so much [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2550.96s)]
*  about President Trump. [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2552.6000000000004s)]
*  And people get upset with me. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2553.44s)]
*  Oh, you're too sycophantic. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2554.6000000000004s)]
*  You're too supportive. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2555.84s)]
*  This is someone who we should all look up to [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2557.52s)]
*  who has taken the hits, taken the shots, literally, [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2559.2s)]
*  and still gets back up every single day. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2562.04s)]
*  And he just sort of starts each day again, [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2564.44s)]
*  almost like a video game character where, [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2566.3199999999997s)]
*  okay, we're starting again yesterday, barrage of bad press, [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2568.3599999999997s)]
*  got shot at, something horrible happened. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2571.44s)]
*  But what are we doing today to make the country better? [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2573.48s)]
*  And I think that's incredible. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2575.8799999999997s)]
*  Trump's approval rating right now is up eight points, [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2577.9199999999996s)]
*  according to Trafalgar. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2581.24s)]
*  It's really amazing. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2583.3199999999997s)]
*  He's doing extremely well. [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2584.52s)]
*  He was down a little bit during the whole tariff, Palooza, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2586.48s)]
*  but Trafalgar's got his numbers as of June, [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2590.4s)]
*  now up eight percentage points. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2593.2s)]
*  How do you feel about President Trump [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2596.0s)]
*  and how he's handling his job? [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2597.2400000000002s)]
*  Strongly approve, 42.1, approve 11.6. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2598.6s)]
*  So that's 53, almost 54% approval rating. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2603.96s)]
*  We've never seen that for him, never. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2609.56s)]
*  That's crazy high for any president in today's day and age. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2611.4s)]
*  And really high for President Trump, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2616.24s)]
*  who's all he gets is Nazi, Hitler, fascist. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2617.92s)]
*  Like he doesn't get positive media coverage. [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2622.12s)]
*  The American public has learned to totally discount [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2624.52s)]
*  the media when it comes to Trump. [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2628.72s)]
*  They know about TDS. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2630.84s)]
*  Well, absolutely. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2634.4s)]
*  I think the legacy media just has less power than ever. [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2635.24s)]
*  I mean, even Jake Tapper, he's on this huge book tour, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2637.44s)]
*  but he has his lowest ratings in 10 years. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2639.7599999999998s)]
*  He's doing less than a hundred thousand in the key demo. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2642.0s)]
*  So it's not that these people don't have influence, [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2644.6s)]
*  it's just that nobody is watching. [[00:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2646.6s)]
*  I hate to say it, MSNBC, their ratings are in the gutter. [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2648.16s)]
*  CNN, your ratings are in the gutter. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2651.16s)]
*  So even if you guys started reporting the real news [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2652.92s)]
*  and you weren't partisan hacks, [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2655.6s)]
*  I just don't think anyone's watching, right? [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2657.04s)]
*  No one gives a rat's ass. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2659.12s)]
*  We wanna scroll through our phones. [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2660.3199999999997s)]
*  We wanna listen to a podcast. [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2662.48s)]
*  We wanna get the news on X. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2663.7599999999998s)]
*  We don't want to watch you. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2665.2s)]
*  And you guys also unmasked yourselves as liars [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2666.56s)]
*  because you told us for years, Joe Biden was in great shape. [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2669.04s)]
*  We found out you were liars. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2671.7599999999998s)]
*  And then overnight, the same people who covered for Biden [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2673.08s)]
*  are telling us Kamala is gonna save democracy. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2675.52s)]
*  And we're like, no, she seems like a drunk wine mom [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2677.96s)]
*  who can barely form a coherent sentence, [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2680.96s)]
*  but they tried to gaslight us. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2682.84s)]
*  So no, President Trump has gotten nothing [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2684.8s)]
*  but negative press for 10 years [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2686.44s)]
*  since he jumped into the race in 2015, [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2688.44s)]
*  but he's still on top because unlike the left, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2690.6s)]
*  he's doing exactly what he campaigned on. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2693.04s)]
*  If you have followed Trump every single day for years, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2695.44s)]
*  he's been talking about the tariffs decades ago on Oprah. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2698.2s)]
*  He was talking about the tariffs. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2701.68s)]
*  He ran on securing the border. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2703.04s)]
*  He said, we don't need this big package. [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2704.96s)]
*  All we need is a new president. [[00:45:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2706.96s)]
*  The border is more secure than ever. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2708.3199999999997s)]
*  He ran on getting men out of women's sports. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2709.96s)]
*  So what does he do one of his first weeks in office? [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2711.7599999999998s)]
*  Beautiful executive order surrounded [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2714.0s)]
*  by all the young women, incredible day, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2715.92s)]
*  the executive order to get men out of women's sports. [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2718.24s)]
*  So I think the left, their heads are reeling [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2720.16s)]
*  because they're just so used to lying [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2722.24s)]
*  and giving empty promises to the public. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2723.92s)]
*  And he came in and said, this is what I ran on. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2725.8799999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna do what I ran on. [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2728.2799999999997s)]
*  I have nothing to lose because I'm one term [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2729.56s)]
*  and I've been through hell to get here. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2731.68s)]
*  So all of you can F off. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2733.2s)]
*  That I think is president Trump's mindset. [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2734.44s)]
*  Okay, speaking of leftist empty, the pidity, [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2736.92s)]
*  Meghan Markle is out there with some medical advice. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2741.96s)]
*  She's giving medical advice now. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2748.2s)]
*  Yeah, link. [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2750.2s)]
*  And she had on confessions of a female founder, her podcast. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2751.12s)]
*  I'm a founder just in case you didn't know. [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2756.0s)]
*  She had on Beyonce's mother. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2758.36s)]
*  And here we go into Dr. Meghan Markle, watch. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2761.44s)]
*  My allergies are. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2767.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh no, do you eat local honey? [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2768.56s)]
*  That can help. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2771.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, I used to and it really does work. [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2772.48s)]
*  I have to get back to that. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2776.1200000000003s)]
*  You have to get back on that because I just, [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2777.4s)]
*  the other day, one of Archie's little friends at school, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2779.76s)]
*  this little girl has such bad allergies. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2782.7200000000003s)]
*  And I said, hold on a minute, we have bees. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2784.28s)]
*  Let me give you a jar of our honey for allergies. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2785.88s)]
*  Helpful because the local, you know, if it's local honey, [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2788.96s)]
*  get that, all the pollen, all the same things [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2792.1200000000003s)]
*  in your system and then it desensitizes allergies. [[00:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2795.28s)]
*  But I'm sorry. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2797.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, what? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2798.6400000000003s)]
*  Thank you. That's no fun. [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2799.48s)]
*  How weird is it that she kept that in, first of all, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2802.52s)]
*  when your guest starts having some sort of a sneezing [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2804.84s)]
*  or coughing attack and you're on team. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2807.44s)]
*  Sorry, Meghan. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2809.28s)]
*  The reason she kept that in and left Beyonce's mother's [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2810.88s)]
*  hacking in there for her audience [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2813.84s)]
*  because she thinks it makes her look empathetic [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2815.6000000000004s)]
*  and super smart to spew her bullshit nonsense about honey, [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2817.6800000000003s)]
*  which by the way, there's been studies on this [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2821.1200000000003s)]
*  and she's wrong, shockingly. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2822.92s)]
*  But you know, Dr. Meghan Markle's got all the answers, Link. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2824.7200000000003s)]
*  She's a jack of all trades. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2828.7200000000003s)]
*  She can't do anything well, but she tries to do everything. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2830.4s)]
*  That is Meghan Markle. [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2834.08s)]
*  So no, she acts like she invented Manuka honey [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2835.48s)]
*  or some of these homeopathic remedies. [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2837.96s)]
*  Also, there's just this undertone of elitism [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2840.04s)]
*  to everything Meghan Markle does. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2842.72s)]
*  Because how many times recently have we had to see videos [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2844.08s)]
*  and pictures of this farm she has for bees on her property [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2847.04s)]
*  and she has her beekeeper outfit. [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2850.9199999999996s)]
*  She really wants to remind us every single day [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2852.68s)]
*  that she has bees, she's mother nature, [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2855.2s)]
*  she's down home, mother of the earth. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2857.52s)]
*  We are sick of hearing about it. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2859.52s)]
*  You know what I'm saying? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2861.44s)]
*  We were tired of seeing her and her beekeeper costume. [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2862.2799999999997s)]
*  And it's like, can't you get any outfits [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2865.3999999999996s)]
*  that look good on you? [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2867.24s)]
*  How come the beekeeper outfit is the most perfectly [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2868.08s)]
*  form-fitting outfit you own? [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2870.7599999999998s)]
*  Everything else is wrinkled and misshapen [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2872.16s)]
*  and two sizes too big. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2874.0s)]
*  So no, I would not be taking medical advice [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2875.4399999999996s)]
*  from Meghan Markle whatsoever. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2877.7999999999997s)]
*  Only we had found her during Maha. [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2879.9599999999996s)]
*  Only if we had found her on the campaign, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2881.7599999999998s)]
*  she would have been a great surrogate. [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2883.3999999999996s)]
*  Literally, this person was saying [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2885.3199999999997s)]
*  that she was seriously considering suicide [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2886.56s)]
*  a couple of years ago because some of the royal family [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2890.16s)]

*  because it's like in her stupid show [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2901.44s)]
*  that they're pretending got renewed by Netflix as ever [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2903.56s)]
*  or with love, whatever it is, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2906.3199999999997s)]
*  she's constantly saying, [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2908.6s)]
*  have you been to your local beekeeper? [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2911.2s)]
*  No, I haven't been in my local, no. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2914.16s)]
*  Literally, nobody's been to their local beekeeper. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2916.64s)]
*  We have jobs, we have kids, [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2919.0s)]

*  that stop us from A, having our own beehive [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2922.92s)]
*  and B, if we don't, going to our local beekeeper [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2926.08s)]
*  for anything. [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2929.64s)]
*  I'm lucky if I can get to the ACME. [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2931.36s)]

*  No, absolutely. [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2933.52s)]
*  There's just this undertone of elitism [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2935.36s)]
*  and something she never talks about [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2937.0s)]
*  because we don't see them on camera. [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2938.36s)]
*  She has a full staff, okay? [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2939.88s)]
*  She has a full staff and she only has two kids. [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2941.76s)]
*  It's not like she's raising the Brady Bunch here. [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2944.12s)]
*  She doesn't need 15 nannies and drivers and chauffeurs, [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2945.8s)]
*  but she has this full entire staff. [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2948.84s)]
*  She has a farm for bees. [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2950.8s)]
*  She has another property that's not even her home [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2952.28s)]
*  that she just goes to film the show in. [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2954.6s)]
*  So then she tries to opine and tell us how to live our lives. [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2956.68s)]
*  You're full of crap, Meghan Markle, [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2959.52s)]
*  but I think this is Meghan Markle's journey. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2961.04s)]
*  Just keep becoming more and more out of touch, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2963.04s)]
*  but remind us that you grew up over a garage [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2966.0s)]
*  with no money and Compton. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2968.28s)]

*  It's always these people who can flip overnight, [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2971.4s)]

*  because it's just insane [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=2976.2s)]

*  to withdraw from the fight, [[00:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3070.48s)]
*  which was supposed to be between two women. [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3072.0s)]

*  through her helmet yelling, this is unjust. [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3076.48s)]

*  but I guess we can't call him a man [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3123.72s)]
*  because he calls himself a woman. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3125.52s)]
*  I don't give a shit. [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3127.3199999999997s)]

*  Some had speculated that they were intersex, [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3146.28s)]
*  meaning they have male chromosomes, [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3148.92s)]
*  they have male internal organs, [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3152.4s)]
*  but they might have a vagina. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3155.04s)]
*  However, they would never develop a male body [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3157.44s)]
*  and they would never develop breasts. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3160.48s)]
*  They would never have a period [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3163.2400000000002s)]
*  because they don't have a uterus, [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3164.52s)]
*  they don't have ovaries, [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3165.96s)]

*  Well, if the passport says it, it must be true. [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3251.16s)]
*  An Olympic boxing trainer in Spain came forward [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3254.36s)]

*  The female Olympians, after years of incredibly hard work [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3274.76s)]

*  Such was the pressure on everyone in her sport [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3298.04s)]
*  and those commenting on it to take a knee on this issue [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3301.08s)]
*  and just accept this is a female. [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3304.68s)]

*  She was born a woman, lives as a woman, [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3321.8s)]

*  So what is the argument against that? [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3324.84s)]
*  This is such an outrage. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3326.8s)]
*  Look at this, this is a man. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3328.6400000000003s)]
*  This is a man who is competing [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3330.32s)]

*  The leftist outlet, Salon, loved that segment. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3353.32s)]
*  Instead of doing any real reporting of its own, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3356.36s)]
*  the outlet just wrote up an article [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3358.2400000000002s)]
*  declaring The Daily Show calls out Megyn Kelly [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3359.52s)]

*  where yours truly was labeled garbage person of the week, [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3376.88s)]
*  simply for telling the truth. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3380.88s)]
*  My garbage person of the week is Megyn Kelly. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3382.7599999999998s)]
*  And in the extended commentary, both Kerry, which you saw, [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3386.48s)]
*  and Megyn Kelly intentionally misgender Amayn Khalif. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3389.68s)]
*  Like a month after they know that Amayn Khalif is a woman, [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3394.52s)]
*  objectively, according to all of their weirdly specific [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3400.0s)]
*  definitional requirements, is a woman, [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3404.68s)]
*  has always been a woman, will always be a woman, [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3407.68s)]
*  and they're still misgendering her a month later. [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3410.92s)]
*  They know that their audiences are all men, [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3413.64s)]
*  and they're men that want to see these women attack [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3417.76s)]
*  and demean and belittle other women. [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3421.92s)]
*  Literally not one word of that is right. [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3426.76s)]
*  Not one word. [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3428.6800000000003s)]
*  Again, another person I've never seen or heard of, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3429.52s)]
*  but the list of attacks did not end there. [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3431.6s)]
*  The media took aim at anyone in conservative media [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3434.84s)]
*  telling the truth about these two boxers. [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3437.6s)]
*  Former ESPN anchor, Jemele Hill, writing on X, [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3440.4s)]
*  I hope Khalif sues some people over their reckless remarks. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3443.12s)]
*  All this story did was expose ugliness, [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3446.56s)]
*  hatred, and transphobia. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3448.48s)]
*  Hill then went on CNN, where she and one of the network's [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3450.7200000000003s)]
*  hosts, Laura Coats, continued to stand up for Khalif. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3453.32s)]
*  People jumped the gun on this before knowing the full story. [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3457.12s)]
*  Conservative right-being at the top of the list [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3461.32s)]
*  are weaponizing trans women and the trans community, [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3464.12s)]
*  and using that as part of their ongoing culture wars. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3467.72s)]
*  That there is certainly a huge issue [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3471.08s)]
*  with transphobia in our country. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3474.56s)]
*  And all it boiled down to was that the woman [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3476.44s)]
*  that she competed again realized after getting hit, [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3478.72s)]
*  she couldn't compete. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3481.7999999999997s)]
*  And rather than accept that gracefully as a competitor, [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3483.04s)]
*  she chose to weaponize this further by crying. [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3487.04s)]
*  There was nothing unjust about it. [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3491.48s)]
*  I mean, to be frank, you just got your butt beat, [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3493.16s)]
*  and that's the end of what happened. [[00:58:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3495.8s)]
*  If you want to protect women and daughters, [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3498.5200000000004s)]
*  she is a woman, she is somebody's daughter, [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3501.1600000000003s)]
*  and she is a woman in sports. [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3503.44s)]
*  It gives concept that old statement, ain't I a woman? [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3505.1200000000003s)]
*  This is unbelievable. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3510.48s)]
*  It's unbelievable that the cover that these women ran [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3512.0s)]
*  for a main Khalif, who is male. [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3515.2000000000003s)]
*  The list goes on and it's long. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3518.1200000000003s)]
*  All right, just listen. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3520.32s)]
*  ESPN analyst, Mina Kimes, shared a similar message. [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3521.44s)]
*  This story has reached thermonuclear levels of BS [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3524.68s)]
*  and grift fueled hate. [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3527.3599999999997s)]

*  appearing on the cover of Vogue Arabia, [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3617.1200000000003s)]
*  going to Milan Fashion Week [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3620.0800000000004s)]
*  and sitting front row at the Bottega Veneta show. [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3622.2000000000003s)]
*  Vogue writing up an article about it that read, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3625.7200000000003s)]
*  for her foray into high fashion, [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3628.2000000000003s)]
*  the gold medalist donning a mustard yellow [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3630.6000000000004s)]
*  button up leather shacket, which is apparently a thing, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3633.76s)]
*  along with a pair of black leather trousers. [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3636.96s)]
*  While she left her medal at home, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3639.48s)]
*  Khalif wore a pair of the Italian House's [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3641.44s)]
*  viral drop earrings in gold, of course. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3643.36s)]
*  So that is a long windup for what I'm about to tell you. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3647.12s)]
*  Nearly a year after Khalif took gold, [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3650.08s)]
*  stole gold, leaked lab results confirm Khalif is male. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3653.12s)]
*  The lab results, the ones that got Khalif banned [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3659.68s)]
*  from the 2023 World Championships [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3662.44s)]
*  were obtained and published by Three Wire Sports. [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3664.44s)]
*  It is the premier Olympics focused media outlet. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3668.08s)]
*  It's run by former NBC and LA Times reporter, [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3670.84s)]
*  Alan Abrahamson. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3673.92s)]
*  Abrahamson came forward last year, you see, [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3676.12s)]
*  during the Olympics to say, [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3678.2000000000003s)]
*  look, I personally have seen these test results [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3680.0s)]
*  for a main Khalif that showed Khalif was male, [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3685.32s)]
*  but no one cared. [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3689.88s)]
*  No one would listen to him. [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3691.52s)]
*  We did, because unlike most in the media, [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3694.0s)]
*  we interviewed Abrahamson back in August [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3696.92s)]
*  regarding what he, an eyewitness, first person [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3700.36s)]
*  to those test results had seen. [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3704.08s)]
*  Watch. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3706.64s)]
*  And then it says result, it says abnormal, [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3707.48s)]
*  and then it says evidence of male karyotype. [[01:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3713.08s)]
*  So a karyotype refers to your chromosomal evidence, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3716.96s)]
*  and here it says male, with a capital M, male. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3722.36s)]
*  Oh, you mean the passport wasn't the final source? [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3727.44s)]
*  We shouldn't have trusted it? [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3732.32s)]
*  Gee, tell it to Mark Adams of the IOC. [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3733.32s)]
*  Now here is what is new. [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3736.92s)]
*  Abrahamson has now actually published the results. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3738.92s)]
*  They state exactly what he said they did on this show. [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3742.96s)]
*  Quote, analysis reveals male karyotype, [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3746.36s)]
*  which means X, Y chromosomes, a male. [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3750.6s)]
*  Abrahamson is also reporting that Khalif is being told [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3756.12s)]
*  by World Boxing that he must take a chromosome test [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3759.12s)]
*  to prove eligibility before returning to competition. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3762.16s)]
*  Khalif is hoping to compete in a boxing match next week, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3765.48s)]
*  but no test, no match. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3768.56s)]
*  As for Lin Yu-Ting, last November, the boxer pulled out [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3770.7999999999997s)]
*  of an international competition in the UK [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3774.12s)]
*  after the organizers questioned his gender eligibility. [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3776.72s)]
*  Both of these two, when actually pressed, saying, [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3780.9199999999996s)]
*  you can't compete because you appear to be a male, [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3784.12s)]
*  have not challenged it. [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3786.24s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3787.8399999999997s)]
*  What does that tell you? [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3789.3599999999997s)]
*  And what about Khalif's gold medal? [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3790.7999999999997s)]
*  Will he be forced to give it back? [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3793.44s)]
*  He should. [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3794.64s)]
*  However, there are zero rumblings [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3796.2799999999997s)]
*  of that actually happening, and Khalif has said [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3798.16s)]
*  he plans to defend his Olympic gold [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3800.52s)]
*  when the Games return to Los Angeles in 2028. [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3802.56s)]
*  He wants all the women's golds, all of them in boxing. [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3805.56s)]
*  And he's not worried about President Trump's stance [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3809.6s)]
*  on men competing in female sports, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3811.92s)]
*  because in March, Khalif told ITV, a media outlet in the UK, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3813.64s)]
*  quote, the US president issued a decision [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3817.12s)]
*  related to transgender policies in America. [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3819.2s)]
*  I'm not transgender. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3822.44s)]
*  This does not concern me, and it does not intimidate me, [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3824.4s)]
*  completely skirting the issue [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3827.4s)]
*  that he appears to be intersex and irrespective [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3830.16s)]
*  of exactly what his particular gender problem is. [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3834.2s)]
*  He's a biological male, which is the problem. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3837.08s)]
*  Separately, the IOC is about to get a new president. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3842.72s)]
*  Zimbabwean Christy Coventry, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3846.48s)]
*  set to take over the job on June 23rd. [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3848.52s)]
*  She's been vocal in her support for a blanket ban on men [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3850.52s)]
*  competing in female sports at the Games. [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3853.8799999999997s)]
*  However, she was part of the IOC executive board [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3855.8799999999997s)]
*  that allowed Khalif and Lynn U-Tin [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3859.3199999999997s)]
*  to compete in the first place, [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3861.6s)]
*  knowing what they already knew about world boxing [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3864.16s)]
*  and them being banned. [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3867.2s)]
*  So to all the female boxers training for the next Olympics, [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3868.9199999999996s)]
*  you better find your voices now to stop it, [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3872.6s)]
*  or lace up your gloves and get ready for a quick and easy [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3877.96s)]
*  and likely dangerous knockout. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3881.96s)]
*  Joining me now, Stephen A. Smith, ESPN host, [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3885.7599999999998s)]
*  and also the host of his own digital show, [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3888.68s)]
*  The Stephen A. Smith Show. [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3890.24s)]
*  Stephen A., great to have you back. [[01:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3892.08s)]
*  What do you make of me and Khalif? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3893.8s)]
*  Great to see you too. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3895.84s)]
*  First of all, your opening monologue [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3897.0s)]
*  was absolutely spot on, way to go. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3899.24s)]
*  There's no disagreement here. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3902.16s)]
*  The facts are the facts. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3906.04s)]
*  And he has XY chromosome, and that's what the test shows. [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3907.12s)]
*  So what you had been saying originally was right on point. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3910.8s)]
*  And there's a lot of people that owe you an apology. [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3914.68s)]
*  I appreciate where you were coming from, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3917.4s)]
*  but I also love the fact that you kept receipts [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3919.0s)]
*  and you pointed out folks that were talking [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3921.04s)]
*  a lot of smack about you. [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3922.52s)]
*  Because the reality is that when we saw in swimming, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3924.24s)]
*  for example, with Leah Thomas and how he transitioned [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3927.64s)]
*  into being a woman and competing in swimming [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3932.36s)]
*  and ultimately won a national championship [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3935.68s)]
*  when it was hard for him to be ranked in the top 300 [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3937.88s)]
*  or 400 in the world when you were competing [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3940.96s)]
*  against males for crying out loud. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3942.84s)]
*  If there is a disadvantage in swimming, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3944.52s)]
*  if there is a disadvantage in something like volleyball [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3947.64s)]
*  or basketball, what in God's name makes anybody think [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3951.7200000000003s)]
*  there wouldn't be a decisive disadvantage for females, [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3954.44s)]
*  born female in a boxing ring? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3957.6800000000003s)]
*  That is a violent sport. [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3960.36s)]
*  That is a pugilistic sport. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3962.12s)]
*  And so the level of sensitivity that you've articulated [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3963.52s)]
*  about this subject, I certainly never disagreed [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3966.6800000000003s)]
*  with you on it, but the points that you've made [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3969.76s)]
*  in your opening monologue, how on point you were [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3972.6s)]
*  and how you kept receipts of people who attacked you [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3975.2000000000003s)]
*  personally for saying what you had said [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3977.68s)]
*  when in fact the facts are born out [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3980.92s)]
*  and have shown that you were on point more so than they do. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3983.8399999999997s)]
*  If they're adults, they will come on [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3987.12s)]
*  and they'll re-air those tapes themselves [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3989.08s)]
*  and they'll say she's right. [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3991.0s)]
*  Megyn Kelly was right. [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3992.3599999999997s)]
*  I owe her an apology. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3993.44s)]
*  That's not Stephen A. saying it [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3994.8399999999997s)]
*  because I don't owe you an apology for that [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3996.2s)]
*  because I never disagreed with you to begin with. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3998.16s)]
*  You had me on the show at that time discussing it [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=3999.96s)]
*  and I stand with you on that. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4002.52s)]
*  You're absolutely right, 1000%. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4004.6s)]
*  It's crazy because it's one thing to see these men running [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4008.32s)]
*  in track meets and clearly they're faster than the women [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4011.08s)]
*  and they can jump higher than the women [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4014.56s)]
*  to no one's surprise, but it's another thing entirely [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4016.2400000000002s)]
*  to see them competing in rugby or ice hockey [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4019.0s)]
*  or field hockey or boxing, boxing for God's sake. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4023.32s)]
*  If we're gonna allow that, we'll allow anything. [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4028.92s)]
*  Yeah, think about it. [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4031.52s)]
*  What if Ronda Rousey when she was fighting in the UFC [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4032.56s)]
*  against O'Connor McGregor or somebody, [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4037.28s)]
*  how would that have looked? [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4038.96s)]
*  We see we gotta take things in. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4040.1600000000003s)]
*  She would have gotten killed. [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4041.0s)]
*  Yes, she would have. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4042.28s)]
*  And so you have to look at things from that standpoint. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4043.52s)]
*  I remember one time she joked around [[01:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4045.12s)]
*  and I have so much respect for her [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4046.4s)]
*  and what she brought to the octagon [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4047.92s)]
*  and her star-studded days [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4049.92s)]
*  before she ultimately went on a loser streak [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4052.4s)]
*  and ultimately retired from the sport. [[01:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4054.28s)]
*  I remember one time she was talking about [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4056.04s)]
*  fighting Floyd Money Mayweather [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4058.12s)]
*  and I was like, pump the brakes now, calm down. [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4059.96s)]
*  Now let's pump the brakes and calm down. [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4062.2000000000003s)]
*  This is something a little bit extra. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4064.6800000000003s)]
*  You're talking about one of the greatest fighters [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4066.48s)]
*  in the history of the sport, all right, [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4068.08s)]
*  who's around your weight class and he's a man. [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4070.36s)]
*  He will do some things to you. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4073.08s)]
*  Yeah, before you could think about grabbing him, [[01:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4074.44s)]
*  there's things he could do. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4076.76s)]
*  So let's be careful about stuff like that. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4078.0s)]
*  But people laughed about it and they shrugged it off, [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4079.8s)]
*  not recognizing the fact that you had individuals [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4082.8s)]
*  within the transgender community [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4085.4s)]
*  that were looking to partake in such actions [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4087.32s)]
*  in terms of being in a boxing ring [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4089.7200000000003s)]
*  or being on a basketball court [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4091.92s)]
*  or being in a swimming competition or what have you. [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4093.28s)]
*  You're male or you're female. [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4096.48s)]
*  And a lot of times I think that as a black man, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4098.5199999999995s)]
*  one of the things that I religiously point to, Megan, [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4100.5599999999995s)]
*  is that it's one thing for people for us to fight [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4103.16s)]
*  on behalf of every human being for their civil rights, [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4106.96s)]
*  their civil liberties and the right to be left alone. [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4110.04s)]
*  But people in today's day and age [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4113.4s)]
*  act like you have to be liked. [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4115.639999999999s)]
*  You know, and as a black man, [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4117.719999999999s)]
*  I expect not to be liked by people sometimes, [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4119.28s)]
*  not just because of the color of my skin, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4121.5199999999995s)]
*  but because they may not like my personality or whatever. [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4122.96s)]
*  I don't walk around looking for approval. [[01:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4125.36s)]
*  I'm sure you don't. [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4127.24s)]
*  We do what we do. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4128.4s)]
*  And a lot of times you see people [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4129.639999999999s)]
*  from different communities, [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4131.0s)]
*  whether it would be an ethnic community [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4132.4s)]
*  or it would be something else [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4134.719999999999s)]
*  where they're looking and demanding acceptance, [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4135.839999999999s)]
*  not just approval, but acceptance. [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4139.4s)]
*  And that's not the real world. [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4141.719999999999s)]
*  You know, your civil liberties [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4143.639999999999s)]
*  and your right to live your life [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4145.32s)]
*  and be what you wanna be. [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4146.599999999999s)]
*  I said this the other day on television, [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4147.44s)]
*  if I remember correctly. [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4148.96s)]
*  I said, hey, you know what? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4150.24s)]
*  You're a transgender athlete. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4151.5599999999995s)]
*  Compete against other transgender athletes. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4152.88s)]
*  How about that? [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4154.88s)]
*  There are other, you ain't the only person [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4155.84s)]
*  that's transitioning that might wanna be in a boxing ring. [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4158.12s)]
*  Find enough of them and compete against one another. [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4161.24s)]
*  Let the ladies compete against the ladies. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4163.76s)]
*  Let the males compete against the males [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4165.2s)]
*  and let the transgenders compete against the transgenders. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4166.4400000000005s)]
*  We understand that. [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4168.88s)]
*  It's no problem. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4169.72s)]
*  It's no big deal. [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4170.56s)]
*  Do it that way. [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4171.38s)]
*  And I think that, you know, [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4172.22s)]
*  that just went in the folks ear and then out the other. [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4173.32s)]
*  But I'm pointing to fairness where there's no discrepancy. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4176.16s)]
*  There's nothing up in the air making you wonder [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4179.72s)]
*  about the fairness of the competition. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4182.76s)]
*  And we also live in a society where for so long, [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4185.360000000001s)]
*  we've highlighted how women have been mistreated. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4190.08s)]
*  And I'm not just talking about stuff [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4194.12s)]
*  like domestic violence and things like that. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4195.46s)]
*  It's obvious. [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4196.8s)]
*  But also in terms of just fairness, [[01:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4197.92s)]
*  Title IX, for example, exists for a reason. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4200.400000000001s)]
*  Well, how do we pay so much attention to that? [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4202.96s)]
*  To get stuff implemented legislatively and what have you [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4206.04s)]
*  and then turn around and ignore that [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4211.08s)]
*  with something like this. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4213.76s)]
*  It makes no sense because I'm thinking [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4215.4s)]
*  about the young ladies out there who have protested, [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4217.12s)]
*  who have felt it was grossly unfair to them [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4219.8s)]
*  to have to compete under such circumstances. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4223.36s)]
*  And the same women we supposedly want to protect so much [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4225.72s)]
*  are the same ladies we're ignoring [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4229.5199999999995s)]
*  when they're making salient points [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4231.5199999999995s)]
*  about who they're going up against [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4233.64s)]
*  and how unfair the competition is. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4236.12s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4238.44s)]
*  I'm just saying something as a sports guy. [[01:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4239.44s)]
*  Yes. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4240.88s)]
*  You tell me like Caitlin Clark is said to be [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4241.92s)]
*  like a Michael Jordan of women's basketball. [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4244.16s)]
*  But if you took- [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4247.16s)]
*  Steph Curry, Steph Curry. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4248.0s)]
*  She's a really great shooter. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4248.82s)]
*  All right, so if you took the actual Steph Curry [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4250.8s)]
*  and put him up against Caitlin in a one-on-one contest [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4253.639999999999s)]
*  where they both went at it with their all, [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4257.32s)]
*  with all their physical gifts [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4259.96s)]
*  and their gifts on the basketball court, what would happen? [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4261.4s)]
*  The likelihood is that she would lose, [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4265.36s)]
*  but it's less harmful because if, for example, [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4267.44s)]
*  Sabrina Nunescu showed up All-Star Weekend [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4271.5199999999995s)]
*  and she competed against Steph Curry [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4274.44s)]
*  in a three-point shooting contest, right? [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4275.839999999999s)]
*  And it was a really ratings bonanza [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4277.799999999999s)]
*  and it came across very, very well, [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4279.879999999999s)]
*  but they were just shooting the basketball. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4283.32s)]
*  I saw that, I saw that. [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4284.719999999999s)]
*  And by the way, she lost to Steph Curry, [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4286.679999999999s)]
*  but she had tied or beaten all the other males [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4289.78s)]
*  in terms of their score that they had registered [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4293.719999999999s)]
*  before her and Steph Curry showed up on the court. [[01:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4296.24s)]
*  So you're talking about shooting the basketball [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4298.599999999999s)]
*  and it's not that big of a deal. [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4300.5199999999995s)]
*  But if you're talking about competing against one another, [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4301.84s)]
*  where physicality comes into play, [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4304.4s)]
*  the likelihood is that she's going to be [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4306.32s)]
*  at a decisive disadvantage. [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4308.16s)]
*  And I'll give you another example. [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4309.5599999999995s)]
*  Dave Chappelle joked about this. [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4310.92s)]
*  He joked about this in the transgender community, [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4312.84s)]
*  if I recall, were up in arms about this. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4315.28s)]
*  Dave Chappelle, the noted comedian, said, [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4317.679999999999s)]
*  what if LeBron James, essentially, I'm paraphrasing here, [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4321.16s)]
*  what if LeBron James had decided to transition [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4323.98s)]
*  to being a woman? [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4327.0599999999995s)]
*  He'd average 800 points a game. [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4328.86s)]
*  Who's going to stop him? [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4330.98s)]
*  You know, that's what he brought up. [[01:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4332.98s)]
*  He said, so we think that we're being fair. [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4334.9s)]
*  We think that we're being okay with our thinking, [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4338.74s)]
*  but we're not taking it into total consideration [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4341.28s)]
*  in terms of how it really, really registers with us. [[01:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4345.54s)]
*  And so when somebody like you comes along [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4347.62s)]
*  and you're very, very passionate about it [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4349.74s)]
*  and you're going at folks for okaying this stuff, [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4351.98s)]
*  they want to attack you. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4354.78s)]
*  And I'm sitting there saying to myself, [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4356.4s)]
*  you can't find something better to do. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4358.5s)]
*  I mean, listen, Megyn Kelly's on a game, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4360.139999999999s)]
*  but you certainly ain't going to win this argument [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4361.98s)]
*  because we're watching and we see, [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4364.58s)]
*  I mean, who couldn't see that you were right? [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4367.0599999999995s)]
*  It was people who didn't want to see. [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4370.259999999999s)]
*  And that's the real problem. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4372.7s)]
*  You didn't want to see it, so you ignored the facts. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4374.82s)]
*  And Megyn Kelly wanted to see it and you have it. [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4378.179999999999s)]
*  It was like Biden's mental infirmity. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4380.74s)]
*  We saw it. [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4382.66s)]
*  You didn't need an expert. [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4384.38s)]
*  You didn't need a medical diagnosis. [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4385.74s)]
*  You didn't need Tapper and Thompson [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4387.94s)]
*  with the big revealing book. [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4389.599999999999s)]
*  You just needed eyes and ears. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4391.38s)]
*  Same thing with this male boxer. [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4392.98s)]
*  It was very obvious taking a look at him. [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4394.74s)]
*  I do want to just mention this to the audience. [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4397.26s)]
*  They know this story, but it's just so telling. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4399.12s)]
*  After my daughter was misinformed by her teacher [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4403.12s)]
*  that there are only 10 of these trans athletes [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4405.719999999999s)]
*  competing in women's sports, which is not true, [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4408.0599999999995s)]
*  I wrote her a very long note, setting the record straight [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4410.9400000000005s)]
*  and giving her the actual facts [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4414.58s)]
*  so she would not be misled by this person with an agenda. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4416.18s)]
*  And at the end of the note, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4419.38s)]
*  I included the following because it's true. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4421.58s)]
*  In 1998, Serena and Venus Williams said [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4423.9800000000005s)]
*  they could beat any male player outside of the top 200 men. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4426.66s)]
*  Karsten Brasch ranked 203rd in the world [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4431.14s)]
*  and they were in the top 10, both of them at the time, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4435.62s)]
*  in the women's. [[01:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4437.78s)]
*  Took up the challenge and easily beat both sisters, [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4438.74s)]
*  six one, six two. [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4441.94s)]
*  He crushed them. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4443.86s)]
*  In 2017, the US women's national soccer team [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4445.179999999999s)]
*  agreed to play a Dallas, Texas under 15 boys team. [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4448.179999999999s)]
*  Under 15, so we're talking about 14 year olds. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4452.139999999999s)]
*  These must be eighth graders. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4454.26s)]
*  And lost, okay, the US women's national soccer team [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4457.179999999999s)]
*  lost five to two against a bunch of 14 year olds. [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4460.0599999999995s)]
*  It happened again in 2023 [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4464.5599999999995s)]
*  when a group of 18 to 20 year old men, [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4466.179999999999s)]
*  amateurs beat a collection of women's all star [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4469.3s)]
*  former national players five zero. [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4472.18s)]
*  And there's just no question [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4475.9s)]
*  that male advantage in sport is real. [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4477.78s)]
*  And if we continue pretending, [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4480.78s)]
*  especially in the contact sports that it isn't, [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4482.26s)]
*  I'm telling you, it's just a matter of time [[01:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4484.7s)]
*  before a woman gets killed. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4486.82s)]
*  It's just a matter of time. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4489.18s)]
*  Well, first of all, again, you're absolutely right. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4490.8s)]
*  Clarisha Shields is a fabulous boxer. [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4493.58s)]
*  Layla Ali, the wonderful marvelous daughter [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4496.18s)]
*  of the late great Muhammad Ali was a marvelous fighter. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4498.9400000000005s)]
*  You don't want to put them in the ring [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4503.34s)]
*  with a male in their weight class to box. [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4505.92s)]
*  That would be a problem. [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4509.4800000000005s)]
*  There's no question about that. [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4511.38s)]
*  And you have to take that into consideration as well. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4512.740000000001s)]
*  And in terms of how you, [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4514.66s)]
*  what your daughter was informed about, [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4515.700000000001s)]
*  that statement about no less than 10 transgender athletes, [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4518.06s)]
*  that statement came directly from the president [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4524.06s)]
*  of the NCAA at the time, just so you know. [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4527.580000000001s)]
*  No, I'm aware. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4531.18s)]
*  I'm aware, which is also not right because also, [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4532.02s)]
*  and this is another thing that we discussed, [[01:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4534.700000000001s)]
*  the, an LGBTQ group actually came out with the numbers. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4536.900000000001s)]
*  And first of all, they said that out sports said, [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4543.620000000001s)]
*  if anything, the numbers of trans athletes in the NCAA [[01:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4547.26s)]
*  are being understated because a lot of them are not out [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4549.9400000000005s)]
*  as trans. [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4553.34s)]
*  They don't want to be out because they don't want [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4554.179999999999s)]
*  to be the next to main Khalif or Leah Thomas. [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4555.0199999999995s)]
*  They just want to win the medals quietly pretending [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4557.0599999999995s)]
*  to be women. [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4559.42s)]
*  And the schools are only too happy to let them [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4560.26s)]
*  because a lot of these schools enjoy the fact [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4562.099999999999s)]
*  that they're beneficiaries of the male advantage, [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4565.0199999999995s)]
*  that the men can win more easily than the women. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4567.46s)]
*  And these schools are like, great. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4569.66s)]
*  It's just another gold medal for us. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4571.26s)]
*  But then it goes on to say that, my note, [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4573.099999999999s)]
*  when I did my research, UCLA School of Law [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4577.0599999999995s)]
*  put out these estimates in just this past February, 2025, [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4579.66s)]
*  we estimate that there are as many as 122,000 [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4583.66s)]
*  transgender youth ages 13 to 14. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4586.3s)]
*  I didn't know that. [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4588.86s)]
*  Who could be participating [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4589.7s)]
*  in high school level team athletics, 122,000. [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4590.54s)]
*  Which would explain all we've seen this past week [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4596.86s)]
*  and alone in California and in Oregon and Washington state. [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4599.5s)]
*  And I didn't even mention, listen to this one, [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4603.0599999999995s)]
*  Minnesota, a girl softball team, which could not win. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4604.82s)]
*  And Stephen, they thought that this team was like, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4609.82s)]
*  cursed, Champlain Park. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4613.0199999999995s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4615.42s)]
*  They're now headed to the state tournament [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4616.9s)]
*  for the first time. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4618.5s)]
*  Yay, everybody's so excited. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4619.5s)]
*  How did it happen? [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4621.34s)]
*  I'll tell you how it happened. [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4622.78s)]
*  There is a pitcher who goes by Marissa, who is a man. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4624.179999999999s)]
*  His actual name is Charlie Dean. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4630.74s)]
*  He now goes by Melissa Rothenberger. [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4632.94s)]
*  Here he is pitching and crushing it. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4635.54s)]
*  And now this guy is going to carry Champlain Park [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4638.86s)]
*  all the way to the state tournament. [[01:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4643.259999999999s)]
*  And here for the first time ever, here, by the way, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4644.7s)]
*  he pitched all seven innings in both games. [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4647.66s)]
*  It was a 14, it was 14 shutout innings [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4650.58s)]
*  against the defending state champions that this guy pitched. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4654.339999999999s)]
*  And here's the coverage from the Minneapolis Star Tribune. [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4658.46s)]
*  The ending could scarcely have been more fitting. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4661.299999999999s)]
*  The Champlain Park softball team, perennial bridesmaids [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4663.54s)]
*  for most of the past decade, [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4666.82s)]
*  finally scaled a hump that had grown mountainous, [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4668.58s)]
*  leaning on the right arm of lanky junior pitcher, [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4671.74s)]
*  Marissa Rothenberger. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4675.66s)]
*  To defeat Rogers 1-0 in the Class 4A, [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4677.259999999999s)]
*  Section 5 Championship on Thursday, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4679.66s)]
*  Rothenberger was masterful. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4681.66s)]
*  What's missing from the coverage? [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4684.5s)]
*  The fact that this is a boy posing as a girl [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4686.219999999999s)]
*  with all the male advantage that comes to any boy. [[01:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4689.139999999999s)]
*  Of course he was masterful. [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4692.099999999999s)]
*  I knew nothing of that story, shame on me. [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4694.42s)]
*  What I would tell you is that, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4697.74s)]
*  had I been the one covering that story, [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4699.860000000001s)]
*  it would have been a lot different than what you just read [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4702.74s)]
*  because of what you highlighted. [[01:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4705.900000000001s)]
*  It's a boy. [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4708.54s)]
*  And this is the thing that I think is very, very important [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4710.02s)]
*  for us to understand, Megan. [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4712.62s)]
*  You have folks out there from the transgender community [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4715.38s)]
*  and those who support the transgender community [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4719.62s)]
*  that are looking at subject matters like this [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4722.62s)]
*  as an indictment against them, [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4726.7s)]
*  instead of seeing it the way that I see it, [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4729.3s)]
*  and I think the way that you see it, [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4732.0599999999995s)]
*  which is pointing out how unfair it is [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4734.42s)]
*  to the young ladies competing against them. [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4738.82s)]
*  And so when we bring it home to that point, [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4741.86s)]
*  that's where our sensitivity needs to elevate. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4744.82s)]
*  There are a bunch of young ladies out there [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4748.5s)]
*  in the world of sports, born ladies, naturally, [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4751.26s)]
*  they're female, and they've worked their tails off [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4755.54s)]
*  to compete. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4759.26s)]
*  We have laws like Title IX in effect [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4760.900000000001s)]
*  to ensure that fairness and equity [[01:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4763.62s)]
*  is accorded to these young ladies. [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4765.74s)]
*  And then all of a sudden, [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4768.34s)]
*  this kind of issue has come about [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4770.3s)]
*  where that's being circumvented, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4772.900000000001s)]
*  and the people that are circumventing the rules [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4775.3s)]
*  are finding a way, or folks are finding a way [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4779.02s)]
*  to make them look like victims, [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4781.820000000001s)]
*  instead of the young ladies [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4784.06s)]
*  who are having their level of competition compromised [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4786.06s)]
*  because they're not going up against other young ladies. [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4789.9400000000005s)]
*  It doesn't matter whether it's 10, 100, 120, 200, whatever. [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4792.780000000001s)]
*  What matters is that it shouldn't happen. [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4798.14s)]
*  Males should compete against males, [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4800.46s)]
*  females should compete against females, [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4801.9800000000005s)]
*  transgenders should compete against transgenders. [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4803.58s)]
*  It's just that simple, [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4806.78s)]
*  because that's what you're talking about, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4808.26s)]
*  fairness and equity of competition. [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4809.86s)]
*  Let's take gambling in consideration. [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4811.58s)]
*  If you were in a position where you had the prowess [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4813.38s)]
*  as an athlete to dictate an outcome, [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4819.26s)]
*  and you gambled on your own sport, [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4822.34s)]
*  or gambled against your team, or whatever it was, [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4825.82s)]
*  to compromise competition, you'd be banned. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4829.179999999999s)]
*  Because the issue of competition comes raining through. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4832.66s)]
*  It's very prolific, it's very potent. [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4836.820000000001s)]
*  You can't do that, because anything [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4838.38s)]
*  that compromises competition in any way [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4841.34s)]
*  threatens to compromise the overall integrity of the sport. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4844.7s)]
*  If we're thinking that way about issues like that, [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4848.18s)]
*  how could you not think about that with issues like this? [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4851.38s)]
*  It makes no sense. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4854.54s)]
*  You know, today, before we came on the air, [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4855.38s)]
*  I was on X and I saw a video, [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4857.38s)]
*  you probably know this story, but I have no idea. [[01:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4859.3s)]
*  I don't follow sports, as you know, [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4862.3s)]
*  but it was a guy at the AAA league level in baseball [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4863.34s)]
*  who played for, he had a shirt that read Tacoma, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4867.18s)]
*  so I guess he's Tacoma, Washington, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4870.26s)]
*  and he was notified by the coach of his team [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4871.74s)]
*  that he wasn't gonna be there the next day [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4876.46s)]
*  because he'd been called up to the big show [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4878.860000000001s)]
*  to go play for Seattle. [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4882.02s)]
*  And it was just this really sweet moment, [[01:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4883.42s)]
*  as sports, as you know, this is the stuff [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4885.58s)]
*  that can draw somebody like me into sports, [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4887.9800000000005s)]
*  where somebody who's worked that hard [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4889.900000000001s)]
*  makes it, they make it, you know? [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4892.9s)]
*  And you see him stunned when he gets the news [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4894.94s)]
*  he's been called up, and every guy on the team [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4898.0599999999995s)]
*  is giving him a huge hug and a high five. [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4900.299999999999s)]
*  They're all so happy for him. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4903.259999999999s)]
*  This is all of their dream. [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4904.66s)]
*  And that, to me, like, separate it apart [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4906.5s)]
*  from the fact that somebody's gonna get hurt or worse, [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4908.98s)]
*  and the fact that it's just not fair [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4911.82s)]
*  to make them compete against somebody [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4914.379999999999s)]
*  who has so many advantages that they don't have. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4915.7s)]
*  I just feel like you're denying these girls [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4918.0199999999995s)]
*  the glorious joy of winning, of excellence, [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4920.42s)]
*  of being the one to get that tap on the shoulder, [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4925.18s)]
*  not having to share the top podium. [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4929.62s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4932.7s)]
*  That's fair because it's what you play for. [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4933.9400000000005s)]
*  And that's what makes us love sports, right? [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4936.02s)]
*  You explain it to me. [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4937.9800000000005s)]
*  Part of the joy of watching sports is to see that moment. [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4939.26s)]
*  Not everybody's a winner, not participation trophy. [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4943.38s)]
*  There are real actual winners that show who's best. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4947.02s)]
*  I give you an example that's closer to home. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4950.78s)]
*  So I think it was 2017 was the year. [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4953.86s)]
*  It was a trash can controversy in baseball. [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4956.9s)]
*  And essentially, the Houston Astros was in the postseason [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4961.3s)]
*  for Major League Baseball. [[01:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4964.1s)]
*  They had gone against the Yankees. [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4965.5s)]
*  And then ultimately they had gone against the Dodgers. [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4967.34s)]
*  And when they captured a championship, [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4969.9400000000005s)]
*  what they would do is they would make these sounds, [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4973.5s)]
*  Megan, on the trash can to give you an indication [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4976.78s)]
*  of what pitch was being thrown or what happened. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4980.620000000001s)]
*  They would like give you a heads up. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4982.9800000000005s)]
*  And so it was acknowledged, [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4985.06s)]
*  but you had people thinking that their championship [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4988.780000000001s)]
*  should have been confiscated. [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4991.5s)]
*  You had a New York Yankees team [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4992.620000000001s)]
*  that thought they would have been in the World Series. [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4993.860000000001s)]
*  You had a Dodgers team [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4995.34s)]
*  that thought they should have been the champions, okay? [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4996.18s)]
*  And that their level of success was compromised [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=4998.46s)]
*  because somehow, some way it gave them an unfair advantage. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5000.900000000001s)]
*  My only point in bringing that up, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5004.780000000001s)]
*  you can bring up trash cans, you can bring up gambling, [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5007.02s)]
*  you can bring up performance enhancing, drug use, anything. [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5010.86s)]
*  And I mean anything that we deem in our society [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5013.62s)]
*  that compromises fair competition is called out. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5017.78s)]
*  It's condemned. [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5023.219999999999s)]
*  Which is why for the life of me, I couldn't understand [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5024.58s)]
*  how when you were going off about Khalif in the boxing ring, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5028.0199999999995s)]
*  and remember, she hit her competitor with one shot, [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5032.339999999999s)]
*  one shot, and she said, uh-uh, this is not normal. [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5038.06s)]
*  I've never been hit like that before. [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5042.02s)]
*  Now, in fairness, I've seen mailboxes [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5044.5s)]
*  like when George Foreman, [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5046.900000000001s)]
*  the late great George Foreman got arrested. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5047.860000000001s)]
*  So he hit some people, I mean, [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5049.26s)]
*  they had never been hit like that either, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5050.860000000001s)]
*  and they were males. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5052.38s)]
*  I mean, one time Joe Frazier turned around and ran from him [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5053.22s)]
*  and he knocked him upside, literally on the top of his head [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5056.02s)]
*  and dropped him. [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5058.54s)]
*  He dropped him about six, seven times, okay? [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5059.38s)]
*  Nobody's one of the most powerful punches [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5061.22s)]
*  in the history of boxing. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5063.06s)]
*  So we understand that. [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5064.14s)]
*  But clearly you're looking at Khalif [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5066.5s)]
*  and you're seeing somebody who looks male. [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5068.54s)]
*  You're seeing somebody that feels like she's a male. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5071.14s)]
*  You have a competitor going against her, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5074.38s)]
*  swearing she was a male. [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5076.0599999999995s)]
*  You called it out, and then the evidence has proven [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5077.58s)]
*  that you were right. [[01:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5081.94s)]
*  My point is, all of these little things [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5082.78s)]
*  that you could point to are things [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5085.54s)]
*  that we wholeheartedly condemn in sports. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5087.68s)]
*  Anything that compromises legitimate competition, [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5091.62s)]
*  we called out. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5095.780000000001s)]
*  So I don't understand for the life of me [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5096.46s)]
*  how a whole bunch of people were against you on this issue [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5098.02s)]

*  It doesn't make sense. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5106.08s)]
*  It's ideology, it's an attempt by some to be empathetic, [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5106.92s)]
*  but it's like, where's your empathy for the girls? [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5111.06s)]
*  Where's your empathy for the women [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5113.400000000001s)]

*  That's the argument. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5117.42s)]
*  Stand by, I'm gonna take a quick break, [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5118.26s)]

*  It was not supposed to get this bad. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5126.14s)]
*  Maybe you were on top of your bills, [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5128.42s)]

*  and loan companies. [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5155.02s)]
*  They have one goal, to drastically reduce [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5156.1s)]

*  but I think that what people don't realize is that [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5356.6s)]
*  as a black man, you do find yourself getting offended [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5360.96s)]
*  at what we've seen from the Democratic Party. [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5366.24s)]
*  So since 1964, since you had Civil Rights Act [[01:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5369.64s)]
*  and then ultimately the Voting Rights Act [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5372.68s)]
*  and then Fair Housing in 1968 and stuff like that, [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5374.16s)]
*  we heard quotes, supposedly purportedly [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5378.68s)]
*  from Lyndon B. Johnson at the time that, [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5381.12s)]
*  you know what, we passed this in the law, [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5382.64s)]
*  we'll have the Negroes vote for us for the next 200 years. [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5385.28s)]
*  Well, it's been over 50, over 60 actually. [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5388.96s)]
*  And for the most part, they've been right. [[01:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5392.24s)]
*  And so when you, I've often said this, [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5394.28s)]
*  because we've been so transparent [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5397.92s)]
*  in our support for the Democratic Party, [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5400.32s)]
*  there's a reason why the black community by and large [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5402.96s)]
*  has been considered disenfranchised. [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5405.88s)]
*  Because on one hand, we have a party [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5408.2s)]
*  that takes us for granted because they know [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5409.88s)]
*  they're going to get our vote [[01:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5411.400000000001s)]
*  and they never really, really had to cater to us. [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5412.4800000000005s)]
*  And on the other side, we've alienated a party [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5414.76s)]
*  who by the way, played a role in pushing civil rights [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5417.8s)]
*  and voting rights legislation in the law in the 60s. [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5420.8s)]
*  And we basically said to hell with you. [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5423.2s)]
*  So as a result, they turned around and said, [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5426.12s)]
*  we're not gonna have their support anyway. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5427.68s)]
*  So you have one party taking us for granted, [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5429.52s)]
*  you have another party assuming [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5431.56s)]
*  they'll never get our support and we get no representation. [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5433.24s)]
*  What I like about what's transpiring right now [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5436.24s)]
*  with Trump's ascension or return to the White House, [[01:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5439.4s)]
*  what I do like about what has transpired [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5442.12s)]
*  is that it's put the Democratic Party in a position [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5444.96s)]
*  where you no longer get to take us [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5448.36s)]
*  or various communities for granted. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5450.16s)]
*  You gotta go out there and earn our vote. [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5453.04s)]
*  You can't get moralistic and sit on your sanctimonious chair [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5455.16s)]
*  and act as if you're above reproach. [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5459.4s)]
*  I watched you and I've watched you interview [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5461.76s)]
*  many, many people. [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5463.96s)]
*  And again, I don't agree with you 100% of the time, [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5464.8s)]
*  I don't expect you to agree with me 100% of the time. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5466.5199999999995s)]
*  But I respect the hell out of your integrity [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5469.4800000000005s)]
*  and what you bring to your show every day. [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5470.56s)]
*  And I watch it every chance I get to be quite honest with you [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5471.96s)]
*  because I'm always learning something. [[01:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5474.72s)]
*  But I love how you are not afraid to hold people accountable [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5476.52s)]
*  on a personal level in terms of how they make you feel [[01:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5482.24s)]
*  about things that they say, the policies that they push forth, [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5486.08s)]
*  the things that they've tried to implement. [[01:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5489.72s)]
*  And that's what I'm paying attention to now. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5491.64s)]
*  Do I like Doge with Elon Musk and his saw [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5493.92s)]
*  and what he was and how he was? [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5497.68s)]
*  I don't like that visual. [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5498.72s)]
*  I sense a flagrant level of insensitivity [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5500.240000000001s)]
*  to federal employees and others who may rely on those jobs [[01:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5504.400000000001s)]
*  and what have you. [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5509.08s)]
*  But with 37 trillion in debt, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5510.08s)]
*  there is no question that waste, fraud, et cetera exists [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5513.0s)]
*  and it needed to be addressed. [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5516.52s)]
*  Did he do the right things? [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5518.6s)]
*  Did he point out the right targets? [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5519.96s)]
*  I don't know. [[01:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5521.6s)]
*  History will show us whether he was accurate [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5523.0s)]
*  in doing so or not. [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5525.200000000001s)]
*  We're looking at Trump, his war on tariffs. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5526.56s)]
*  I told you from Jump Street, [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5528.76s)]
*  I didn't like that, I didn't like the fact [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5530.200000000001s)]
*  that he was going after everybody. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5531.64s)]
*  Go after China, you want to go after China, [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5532.4800000000005s)]
*  go after China. [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5533.6s)]
*  But don't turn allies into enemies [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5534.4400000000005s)]
*  that could potentially side with China. [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5536.280000000001s)]
*  He made me nervous with that. [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5537.8s)]
*  Now again, I don't know. [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5539.120000000001s)]
*  This is what I was seeing and saying, wait a minute, [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5540.68s)]
*  I'm a bit worried here. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5542.4400000000005s)]
*  Don't know if this is accurate or not. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5543.52s)]
*  But then when I see so many pundits from the left [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5545.400000000001s)]
*  and they're talking about how awful all of this was, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5548.320000000001s)]
*  I took the liberty of just looking at some things [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5551.04s)]
*  and I'm saying, you know what? [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5554.0s)]
*  You're not going to cut so much into spending [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5554.96s)]
*  when it's $37 trillion in debt. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5558.08s)]
*  You're creating new jobs. [[01:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5560.16s)]
*  You got eight trillion in commitments [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5561.6s)]
*  from corporations, okay? [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5563.28s)]
*  You got oil that, you know, we're drilling here [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5564.76s)]
*  in the States as they say. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5567.96s)]
*  There's a plethora of other things that's taking place [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5569.4s)]
*  that are going to contribute to the economy, [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5571.4800000000005s)]
*  that's going to contribute to other people being employed. [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5573.2s)]
*  This is what we're hoping for. [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5575.36s)]
*  If it doesn't work, I'll be up here saying it didn't work. [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5576.96s)]
*  I think Megyn Kelly will be up here saying, [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5580.4s)]
*  it didn't work, damn it. [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5582.28s)]
*  But we can't knock them for trying [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5583.8s)]
*  because what was the other side doing? [[01:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5585.72s)]
*  Building debt and while you were doing so, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5587.92s)]
*  you were trying to guilt us into voting for you [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5590.4800000000005s)]
*  by throwing as much hate array as possible on that guy [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5594.16s)]
*  instead of highlighting, instead of highlighting for us [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5597.8s)]
*  what made you the better candidate. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5600.88s)]
*  And when I think about it from that perspective, [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5603.52s)]
*  I get really, really upset. [[01:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5606.0s)]
*  And I know a lot of black folks [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5607.56s)]
*  and a lot of minorities in this country [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5609.12s)]
*  who get very, very upset [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5610.96s)]
*  because we want to get to a point where [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5612.72s)]
*  your policy against their policy, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5615.360000000001s)]
*  what's best for America? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5618.0s)]
*  What you got? [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5619.64s)]
*  And we're not seeing that. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5620.8s)]
*  And as a result, Trump's able to come in there [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5622.52s)]
*  and say to hell with all of y'all, [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5624.88s)]
*  this is what I'm going to do. [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5626.08s)]
*  And there's little that anybody can say [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5627.2s)]
*  until we show us fails. [[01:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5628.68s)]
*  They can't stick with a hate array forever. [[01:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5630.16s)]
*  Every once in a while you need some nice tea. [[01:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5632.0s)]
*  That's right. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5635.56s)]
*  However, we're getting something very different still [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5636.400000000001s)]
*  from top Democrats like Tim Walz, [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5638.320000000001s)]
*  who has got a different plan for the Democrats [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5641.28s)]
*  to improve on these numbers. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5643.32s)]
*  And here is part of it, Sat 17. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5644.679999999999s)]
*  Called out on this because I called Donald Trump [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5648.16s)]
*  a wannabe dictator. [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5651.24s)]
*  It's because he is. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5652.5599999999995s)]
*  It's because he is. [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5654.5199999999995s)]
*  The governor's being mean [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5656.28s)]
*  and the governor's speaking out on that. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5657.84s)]
*  Well, maybe it's time for us to be a little meaner. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5659.639999999999s)]
*  Maybe it's time for us to be a little more fierce. [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5661.84s)]
*  We have to ferociously push back on this. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5665.44s)]
*  And again, I'll speak to my teacher colleagues in here. [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5668.24s)]
*  The thing that bothers a teacher more than anything [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5671.639999999999s)]
*  is to watch a bully. [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5674.0s)]
*  To watch this bully and to stop it. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5675.719999999999s)]
*  And when it's a child, you talk to them [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5677.8s)]
*  and you tell them why bullying's wrong. [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5680.76s)]
*  But when it's adult like Donald Trump, [[01:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5682.84s)]
*  you bully the shit out of him back. [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5684.719999999999s)]
*  You push back. [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5686.5199999999995s)]
*  You make sure they know it's not there. [[01:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5689.719999999999s)]
*  Because at heart, at heart, [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5692.0s)]
*  this is a weak, cruel man that takes it out [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5695.44s)]
*  and punches down on people. [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5698.639999999999s)]
*  Here we go again, Stephen A. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5702.679999999999s)]
*  He's a wannabe dictator. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5704.4s)]
*  You need to bully the shit out of him. [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5706.0s)]
*  We need to be meaner. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5708.16s)]
*  We need to be fierce, [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5709.5199999999995s)]
*  which is literally like a word that my young children [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5711.04s)]
*  rejected about three years ago. [[01:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5713.719999999999s)]
*  I don't mind. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5716.32s)]
*  I don't mind, Megan, to be honest with you, [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5717.24s)]
*  as long as you have policies to back it up. [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5719.879999999999s)]
*  Because you see, we can talk about [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5722.28s)]
*  Donald Trump bloviating all we want to. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5724.36s)]
*  And by the way, I don't like him suing media [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5726.12s)]
*  and going after folks and feeling as if you're compelled [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5728.639999999999s)]
*  to agree with him and to not insult him. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5731.92s)]
*  Otherwise, he's going to target you. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5734.0s)]
*  I do think that's petty from time to time. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5735.719999999999s)]
*  And I do think that he should be better than that. [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5737.759999999999s)]
*  But in the same breath, if I'm looking at you [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5740.36s)]
*  and I'm saying, like I told you, I wrote stuff down. [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5742.599999999999s)]
*  This big, beautiful new deal and all of this other stuff. [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5745.0s)]
*  Well, guess what? [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5747.88s)]
*  Eight trillion and pledge US jobs, [[01:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5749.0s)]
*  tax cuts on small businesses, fair trade, [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5750.799999999999s)]
*  no tax on tips, no tax on overtime, [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5752.92s)]
*  makes 2017 tax breaks are permanent, deregulation, [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5755.12s)]
*  no more green energy subsidies. [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5759.4400000000005s)]
*  These are the kind of things that I just wrote down. [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5761.32s)]
*  If I'm wrong about anything that I said, Megan, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5763.04s)]
*  please tell me and I'll correct myself. [[01:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5765.28s)]
*  But when I hear that, I'm like, okay, [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5767.6s)]
*  I don't like how he acts sometimes. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5770.52s)]
*  I don't like how juvenile he comes across sometimes. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5773.4800000000005s)]
*  But I know it's more important that I hear that [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5776.68s)]
*  when I just read off to you. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5778.6s)]
*  I know it's more important to the American citizen. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5779.8s)]
*  I know it's more important to the voter. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5781.84s)]
*  And what do you have to offer if you're the other side? [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5783.8s)]
*  See, that's the whole point. [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5787.4800000000005s)]
*  We're fierce. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5789.12s)]
*  You can talk. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5789.96s)]
*  Well, listen, you talk about being fierce. [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5790.8s)]
*  Well, you just got your ass kicked in the election. [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5792.76s)]
*  Okay, I mean, I don't really wanna hear that. [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5795.68s)]
*  Cabo Harris was literally out there last week [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5797.28s)]
*  in Australia saying, I eat no for breakfast. [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5799.2s)]
*  Okay, you were delivered no on a silver platter [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5801.68s)]
*  by the American voters. [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5803.8s)]
*  And here's the deal, but this is what they hold it on to. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5805.400000000001s)]
*  He got 49.8% of the vote. [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5808.68s)]
*  We got 48.3. [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5811.160000000001s)]
*  We only lost by one and a half percentage points [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5813.160000000001s)]
*  and neither side got 15% of, 50% of the vote. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5815.68s)]
*  So guess what? [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5818.96s)]
*  It's not a mandate. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5819.8s)]
*  The man won young voters. [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5820.72s)]
*  He got more black voters. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5823.400000000001s)]
*  He got more young voters. [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5825.04s)]
*  He won every swing state. [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5826.320000000001s)]
*  He won the popular vote for the Republican party [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5827.8s)]
*  for the first time since 2004. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5830.12s)]
*  I mean, damn, what do you need [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5831.76s)]
*  in order for there to be labeled a mandate? [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5833.8s)]
*  I don't understand it. [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5836.280000000001s)]
*  But nevertheless, in a loss, to reflect upon the loss [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5837.64s)]
*  and to talk about pushing back, pushing back, [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5842.160000000001s)]
*  pushing back on them, that's all you got. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5844.64s)]
*  And oh, by the way, if that is what you really, really feel, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5847.08s)]
*  how come you didn't do it during the campaign? [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5851.04s)]
*  How come you didn't do it [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5853.280000000001s)]
*  when you were on the debate stage versus JD Vance? [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5854.12s)]
*  I mean, if there was ever a kumbaya moment in politics, [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5856.52s)]
*  it was him against JD Vance. [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5861.160000000001s)]
*  I mean, they did everything by hugging, kiss, or whatever. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5862.92s)]
*  I mean, this is what was going on. [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5865.08s)]
*  They even parody did on Saturday Night Live. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5866.56s)]
*  I mean, this is how funny it was. [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5868.92s)]
*  And so when you're looking at it from that standpoint, [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5870.84s)]
*  where was all of that when you had the ear [[01:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5873.040000000001s)]
*  of the Democratic presidential nominee [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5876.160000000001s)]
*  that is Kamala Harris? [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5879.0s)]
*  Where was all of that then? [[01:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5880.56s)]
*  We don't want, I respect Tim Walsh, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5881.92s)]
*  you're the governor of Minnesota. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5885.4800000000005s)]
*  I get what you bring to the table, whatever that may be. [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5886.4400000000005s)]
*  God bless you. [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5888.88s)]
*  But you had an opportunity to make all of this noise before. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5889.84s)]
*  And if you missed out on it, [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5893.040000000001s)]
*  we certainly don't wanna hear from you now. [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5895.08s)]
*  That in sports parlance, Megan, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5896.8s)]
*  that is the equivalent of losing the championship [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5898.64s)]
*  by getting swept and then going to talk shit [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5902.8s)]
*  about the opponent. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5905.8s)]
*  How that work? [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5907.0s)]
*  You had an opportunity to beat them. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5908.16s)]
*  They ran by calling Trump a dictator, [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5910.36s)]
*  comparing him to a Nazi, calling him Hitler. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5912.72s)]
*  Like how much meaner do they think they should get? [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5915.92s)]
*  I don't understand where's the extra room [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5918.24s)]
*  for them to get even meaner, a little meaner, more fierce, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5921.16s)]
*  and to bully the shit out of him. [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5925.72s)]
*  How do you do that in a way that they didn't already do that? [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5927.16s)]
*  I don't know how you're gonna do that, [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5929.4400000000005s)]
*  but more importantly, I don't know why you would think [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5931.4400000000005s)]
*  that would work considering how we've shown you, [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5933.8s)]
*  we felt about you during the election. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5937.400000000001s)]
*  Even people like me who voted for her, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5940.6s)]
*  I voted, I didn't like his incivility. [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5943.04s)]
*  I thought the presidency was a statesmanship position. [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5945.24s)]
*  But in the same breath, I was hopeful [[01:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5947.88s)]
*  that she would be somebody that would work across the aisle [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5949.4400000000005s)]
*  and that you would be able to police some things [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5951.8s)]
*  that was going on on the left. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5954.6s)]
*  I regret that, okay? [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5956.160000000001s)]
*  Not to say that I would vote for him, [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5958.160000000001s)]
*  but I certainly don't like the thought of voting for her. [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5959.56s)]
*  And so I'm looking at our politics. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5962.76s)]
*  This is such a fun thread. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5963.6s)]
*  But now we only have 16 seconds left, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5965.0s)]
*  so we've gotta put a pin in this one [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5967.360000000001s)]
*  and pick it back up the next time [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5968.88s)]
*  since I'm running out of time. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5969.96s)]
*  We have to put it back up, [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5970.8s)]
*  we have to pick it back up another time, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5971.64s)]
*  no doubt about that. [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5973.4800000000005s)]
*  But I don't like what I'm seeing from the left, [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4YOn1LVCLxI&t=5974.320000000001s)]
