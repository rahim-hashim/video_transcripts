*  This is from a special not like on this show [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=177.51999999999998s)]
*  But you were talking about your then girlfriend and how obsessed she was with crime shows [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=179.6s)]
*  Yeah, I can totally relate to this [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=184.56s)]
*  And however you did this bit on how you know [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=186.72s)]
*  You'd watch nfl uh football with her and she'd be like and some guy would have a compound fracture with the blood everywhere in [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=188.48s)]
*  The bone and every guy you know be like, oh my god, and she'd be like when is someone coming to murder him? Yeah. Yeah [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=194.07999999999998s)]
*  It's like not savage enough. Yeah. Why do you guys like the the serial killer? I have my own theories [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=200.16s)]
*  I think it's because like when you grow up, you know who gets murdered who gets attacked when it's stolen young women [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=205.84s)]
*  Yeah, we're the victims and so like it's instilled in you from an early age by your parents by your friends by your teachers by tv [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=212.56s)]
*  The news like you're the victim like and so, you know you walk around everywhere like oh my god [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  And then you there's a morbid fascination with what happens to others like how do I prevent that from happening to me? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=224.88s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's why so yeah, it's fear-based. So this is like this. Yeah gigantic fear you have. Yeah, we're working something out [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=230.07999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=236.32s)]
*  It's like the same way my 11 year old likes to watch shark videos all the time because he thinks he's gonna get eaten by a shark [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=236.72s)]
*  Totally and meanwhile [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=241.84s)]
*  So what is our fear? What is our [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=244.08s)]
*  Why don't you know what I'm just not afraid of anything [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=248.32s)]
*  I'm embarrassed to tell you that i've been dreaming lately about the am update that we've been doing as a new pod that we've [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=250.8s)]
*  Launched in our feed. It's very embarrassing. I mean your dreams are about news now [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=256.0s)]
*  Okay, because I do it either really later early morning and it's just on my mind and you shouldn't dream about news [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=259.6s)]
*  That's just sad. Yeah, right. That's well, this is your passion [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=265.76s)]
*  Yeah, you dedicate your life to you see but I could relate to didn't you say [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  Did I hear this in the special that you were saying your girlfriend always dreams about you cheating on her? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=272.32000000000005s)]
*  Oh, yeah, my wife your wife. Yeah, she dreams about me cheating on her. Yeah [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  So I've had that dream with doug too and if I have that dream the next day I am such a bitch to him [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=278.72s)]
*  Right. It is it is funny that you punish us for it, right? But yeah, yeah, that was what I was saying [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=283.6s)]
*  I think in the special it's like why can't I have those dreams? It's almost like you're like go through it. Yeah [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I was like, i'd like to know exactly but yeah [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=293.6s)]
*  It was it's almost as like, you know god shot like the dream arrow and like it was just like a degree off [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=295.76000000000005s)]

*  Where i'm cheating on her or was she's cheating on you? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=308.48s)]
*  I think I might have had something and I woke up upset. I think it's like this is my sexism coming out. But like [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=311.92s)]
*  When a when a woman cheats like even in like a movie [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=318.72s)]
*  like [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=322.8s)]
*  My my thought is like who wrote this? [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=324.32s)]
*  Yeah, this is twisted shit like like if I watch a serial killer thing i'm like, okay, this is what it is [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=328.56s)]
*  But if I see like a woman being unfaithful in something i'm like there is a diabolical [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=334.0s)]
*  Madman out there writing this shit like we need to like lock him up. Like why would you promote this? We're lost as a society [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=339.68s)]

*  you know, there's this like this prominence in uh, [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=406.08000000000004s)]
*  We're talking about relationships now like talking about like red flags and ick culture have you heard about this? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=409.59999999999997s)]
*  No, I've got to be too old [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=414.32s)]
*  Okay [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=415.67999999999995s)]
*  So like a lot of women talk about like red flags and icks they have with men like little things that they do that annoy them [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  Okay [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=421.67999999999995s)]
*  And um, it could be something like small like if it's raining and a guy lifts his shoulders [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=422.64s)]
*  I don't like that. It like really turns me off to him. That's like tough. Yeah, exactly [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=427.03999999999996s)]
*  so and like they're really like nuanced and specific and [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=430.79999999999995s)]
*  I was like, what do you I was asking like, what do you think that's about? And um, [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=433.76s)]
*  Um [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=437.68s)]
*  This is my suspicion [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=438.88s)]
*  I think that like there's so much pressure for women to be with somebody that [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=440.96s)]
*  They maybe would rather be with somebody they don't really like than be alone [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=445.68s)]
*  Like their moms are constantly going. Hey, you gotta get married [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=451.12s)]
*  You gotta have someone and then you're with someone you don't like oh god [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=453.52s)]
*  And when you're around someone you don't like everything about them annoys you no, you can't have that no [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=457.36s)]
*  And then you're gonna let them get on top of you never no never how could you but if you really love someone like you said [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=461.76s)]
*  They can go to columbia with the boys. It has an the opposite effect. It's like nothing bothers me at all [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=467.6s)]
*  It's all really cute. Yeah [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=472.56s)]

*  Yes, so there wasn't exactly like this big display. I don't remember my parents ever correcting table manners [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=631.1999999999999s)]
*  You just it's something I I picked up on later in life when I got to be more of a professional person [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=635.8399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, but I still have questions like here's one question for the audience. Maybe they know maybe you know this [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=640.7199999999999s)]
*  When you're eating soup [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=644.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you go outside in or no that I know you're supposed to go from the front to the back [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=646.56s)]
*  I know you're supposed to I don't think that's the front to the back [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=650.4s)]
*  It is stupid but you're supposed to do motion like why would you move the food further away from you? [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=652.72s)]
*  This is this like pretentious like british shit where they're it's like [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=657.04s)]
*  Really wealthy people have to find a way to make you feel insecure about you not having money [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=661.12s)]
*  And then when everybody started wearing suits, it's like all right. Well, we got to belittle them somehow [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=665.92s)]
*  Oh if you see somebody moving the spoon out, then they really have money. I hate this shit [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=669.84s)]
*  I I what I love about america is the lack of rules in that regard [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=674.72s)]
*  Yes, like we're not trying to keep up with the joneses. Well, here's my question on it though in addition to those [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=677.84s)]
*  What do you do with the soup spoon? [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=683.2800000000001s)]
*  When you are in the middle you want to put it down [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=685.2800000000001s)]
*  And or when you're done, does it go right back in the soup or does it go on the little [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=688.8000000000001s)]
*  I accidentally move it off the table and it falls and I go oh god and then somebody gets that's not okay [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=693.0400000000001s)]
*  No, it's either supposed to go right back in the soup [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=697.84s)]
*  Which is what I think you're supposed to do [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=699.6800000000001s)]
*  Or you're supposed to put it on the plate like the saucer underneath the soup that plate that's holding the soup bowl [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=701.2800000000001s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, but one of them signifies to the waiter that you're finished and one signifies you're still eating [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=706.0s)]
*  With the soup that's true, too. I just made that up. Okay, but it seems like it makes sense [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=712.24s)]
*  I do know what to do on the plate when you want to signify you're done [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=716.4s)]
*  Knife in between the fork fork and knife at five o'clock [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=720.72s)]
*  Yes, like one's it. Well, I guess 10 of five at 10 of five [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=726.8s)]
*  So one's at the 10 and one's at the five on your plate. Yeah that I got yeah, that's my one thing [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=730.88s)]
*  Isn't it crazy that we have to like speak in code to the waiters at the restaurant, right? [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=736.32s)]
*  Yo, yeah that works right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Nothing left on the plate. Are you a good tipper? Yeah [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=742.72s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I work in the service industry. That's the thing. Yeah, if you've ever done it same [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=749.28s)]
*  Yeah, I have to say so I have like what is a good tip for you. Well, I I always leave 50 percent [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=754.24s)]
*  What five oh, yeah, I I always leave 50 but can I tell you something kind of surprising? [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=758.72s)]
*  You think is it good or it's bad it's good. Yeah, it's a lot right. I mean [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=766.08s)]
*  They're not the government. Well, I [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=771.92s)]
*  I always want to be overly generous to the wait staff. I mean, wow, that is I gotta tell you something [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=774.4s)]
*  It I never and I go to women don't usually tip. I just want to point point that out [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=779.76s)]
*  That's not a big thing. That one's important to me. You that is you will never read a report about me being a bad tipper [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=783.52s)]
*  I wow, i'm not going 50. What do you go? [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=790.0s)]

*  I go like 25 or something like that. That's you know, I keep it round [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=795.04s)]
*  I got this from sean hannity who tips 100 percent he does. Yes. Oh wow [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=799.12s)]
*  Like that's too much. No, no, that's guilt. Something's going on. Something's going on. He's a really generous guy [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=805.12s)]
*  He's harassing waitresses [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=810.32s)]
*  Something's happening where he's paying them off a hundred percent is guilt. There's something wrong [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=811.84s)]
*  But I gotta be honest with you. This is he's taking no, I mean sean is a great guy. You're not doing this [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=817.04s)]
*  You're not at all. Where's my camera? [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=822.08s)]
*  You're not at all doing this [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=823.52s)]
*  But I would tip 100 percent too if I was taking my girlfriend to the fucking thing and I don't want anybody to know about it [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=824.72s)]
*  But sean would never do that and that's not the case. Not it. Listen, he does not he does not need to stray [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=829.84s)]
*  He's with ainsley. He's good [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=835.2s)]
*  Well, listen [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=838.48s)]
*  I was gonna say I would have I would kind of expect that when I go back to these same restaurants and have the same [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=838.96s)]
*  Waiter like maybe i'd get a little bit more white glove treatment. Yeah, I noticed absolutely no white glove treatment [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=843.84s)]
*  I don't think it really counts. So I just have to feel good about it in my heart [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=849.9200000000001s)]
*  Which I do not the reason why we do it [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=853.6s)]
*  I mean, it would be nice if somebody was like thanks. Thanks for it [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=855.52s)]
*  But I the worst one you're like at the bar and you're like i'm gonna fucking tip the but this bartender big [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=858.4s)]
*  And you go to put the money down and they walk away and now you gotta just stand there until they come back and notice [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=863.76s)]
*  I need your recognition that I left that like this needs to be very clear [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=870.0s)]
*  My 13 year old daughter just asked this question at the dinner table last night. This is where it's going for you [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=874.32s)]
*  um, she said is [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=879.36s)]
*  any act of charity [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=882.0s)]
*  Ever for the other person or is it all really out? [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=884.4s)]
*  Is or is it isn't it all selfish? [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=887.6800000000001s)]
*  um [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=890.1600000000001s)]
*  I would like to believe that we are capable of altruism [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=891.52s)]
*  But I think that there are like percentages of selfishness for sure like if you're doing it to get to heaven that seems pretty selfish [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=894.88s)]
*  Yeah, that's that's what she was saying and she was saying even just to make yourself feel good [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=900.0s)]
*  There's an element of selfishness in it. And then my brother-in-law said what if you threw yourself on a grenade? [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=903.2s)]
*  And she said no still you're doing it like there's some piece of you that's doing it to feel good about saving somebody [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=908.16s)]
*  Or you might be like a word of the medal of honor if you're you know, like there's something in there [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=913.44s)]

*  You could not that's a good point. That's a good point. Wow, that is uh, that is a sophisticated thought for a 13 year old [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=925.6800000000001s)]
*  I know has she watched everything everywhere all at once [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=931.12s)]
*  Well, she she watches some of the dateline specials with me that's probably part of it though tonight [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=935.76s)]
*  She's got that side where she's deep and philosophical and cynical in some ways [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=940.0s)]
*  But tonight she'll be starring as ursula in the little mermaid at her school play. Did she pick ursula? [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=943.36s)]
*  Yeah, she tried out for it. Yeah, so she wanted ursula. Yeah [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=947.84s)]
*  We gotta keep an eye on this girl right here. We gotta keep a very close watch on this girl [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=950.8s)]
*  This is because it is I think that what she's what she's approaching is like a very realistic way of looking at life [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=955.12s)]
*  You know, which is a but sometimes having that view of humanity can be difficult to handle [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=961.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's a really sophisticated view of it's very hard with a with a mother who's in news and a father who is as [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=967.12s)]
*  Cynical and funny as doug is yes [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=972.48s)]
*  It's just there are kids have a very healthy sense of humor which you would appreciate but like very realistic [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=974.3199999999999s)]
*  Yeah, you know [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=979.4399999999999s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=980.0s)]
*  I'm trying to think like what is the like the positive impact of that is you can have probably like really mature conversations with them [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=980.16s)]
*  Yeah, she's definitely ahead of her time. What is her school did it? It's a private school. It's all girls [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=985.92s)]
*  I will say it's more woke than I would like [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=991.52s)]
*  Not as woke as the one we pulled her from in New York City [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=994.56s)]
*  That's the the conversation I have with parents public and private is is the exact same one that we're having right now [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=997.12s)]
*  Yeah, it's just like yeah [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1002.88s)]
*  They're all kind of like woke to use that term and it's kind of like a we've beaten that term to the ground [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1004.0s)]
*  No, they just had one of the um, I know it was martin luther king day [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1008.88s)]
*  Yeah [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1013.1999999999999s)]
*  And they had an assembly and they had the head of dei go in there and talk to the girls and said just just as a reminder [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1013.4399999999999s)]
*  We believe in equity everyone has the right to wind up in the same space [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1019.6s)]
*  Yeah, and of course my daughter my kids are primed on this, you know [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1024.96s)]
*  We're inoculating them against this bullshit at home [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1027.6000000000001s)]
*  She knew enough to come home and be like mom. This is what they said and I was like no [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1030.32s)]
*  She's absolutely right on the next test when you study hard and the girl next to you doesn't [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1033.28s)]
*  She has a right to see your answers. You have to show them to her [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1038.0800000000002s)]
*  She has the right to get the same grade as you no matter how much work you did or didn't put into it [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1041.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean that is funny to to have a di program at an all-girl school well that it's like you don't even accept men [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1045.4399999999998s)]
*  but that's [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1052.1599999999999s)]
*  Those are selecting out a group of people you really can't continue that conversation [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1054.9599999999998s)]
*  Well, they can't have the oppressors and the patriarchy running the school [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1059.12s)]
*  That is wait. Are there are there any like male leadership in this? Yes [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1061.9199999999998s)]
*  Well, not leadership, but there are plenty of male teachers just male teachers. Yeah, but no male leadership [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1065.28s)]
*  No, there isn't no. Well, wait, i'm wrong when you get to the high school [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1069.84s)]
*  There's a there's a head of the high school. I mean, she's only a middle school, but so we're not there yet [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1072.88s)]
*  Yeah, I don't I don't think they're against men [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1077.2s)]
*  But you know we did a bunch of research when the kids were really young on single sex education [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1079.44s)]
*  And it seemed like they could focus through eight [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1083.92s)]
*  It was a good idea and the good thing about this high school is when she gets to high school [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1086.4s)]
*  She'll mix now with boys [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1090.64s)]
*  So that's good because you know at some point you have to learn how to be around the opposite sex [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1092.48s)]
*  Yeah, you do. I wonder i'm surprised. It's that way not the opposite way. What do you mean like co-ed k-8? [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1095.44s)]
*  Yeah, single sex. Yeah, I think they're looking I think for girls the philosophy is [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1101.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, they'll they they won't um be afraid to say how they feel because you know in middle school [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1106.56s)]
*  It's awkward for everybody and maybe around the boys. You're a little bit more buttoned up [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1112.48s)]
*  Yes [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1116.0s)]
*  And then in the younger grades boys tend to be more disruptive and kind of bigger pains in the ass and girls are like [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1116.32s)]
*  Well-behaved and so then they get demonized so it can be better better for them to be alone too [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1122.56s)]
*  You know where they're not being compared to the well-behaved girls [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1127.4399999999998s)]
*  Like at our boys school the first thing they do for the k-3-5ers [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1131.3600000000001s)]
*  Is they let them go to gym for like an hour get it out the system get it out. That's smart [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1134.8s)]
*  Right, that's really smart, but girls don't need that. They're just ready to pay attention and lock in I mean, oh, it's amazing [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1138.56s)]
*  Yeah, isn't this funny you have all this to look forward to with your now one year baby. I'm so excited [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1144.8s)]
*  Yeah, it's great. It is like terrifying though. All these things are scary. You don't know anything [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1149.04s)]
*  You really don't know anything and now I like I have this I have this amazing empathy for uh, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1153.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I don't want to like politicize this too much but like even these like hot button topics like you know [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1158.96s)]
*  vaccination and these kind of things like [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1164.3s)]
*  If you don't have children like you really don't even need to be part of the conversation at all [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1166.0s)]
*  Because you don't understand the fear of making a decision that could negatively impact your daughter either way [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1169.84s)]
*  Yes to do it and then something happens god forbid now you feel that responsibility [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1175.6799999999998s)]
*  You don't do it and something happens you feel that responsibility [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1181.1999999999998s)]
*  Yes, and you're constantly you know, these decisions are put in front of you [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1185.28s)]
*  It's like oh well like you're trying to rely on your doctor and you're you know [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1188.8s)]
*  You try to find a good doctor and just do what he says [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1192.72s)]
*  But then this whole past five years has really undermined health in doctors and public health officials, right? [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1194.96s)]
*  So you're kind of like every institution. I feel like we have super low confidence in yeah [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1200.56s)]
*  Every pediatrician that we've had has recommended that we get them the coveted vaccine, which we didn't yeah my current no [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1204.8s)]
*  No, not my fake one. Oh, no, I got myself the vaccine which I regret [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1210.16s)]
*  But I did not get it from my kid. Did you get a booster? Yes. I got one booster [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1214.08s)]
*  Oh, I didn't I got I got a fake booster so I could do a movie. I wish I had gotten fake. I got you [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1217.76s)]
*  There's like some stupid Jewish guy in in Brooklyn that I went to oh, come on [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1222.08s)]
*  Yeah, why didn't I know any of this and then I gave it to the movie company to prove them that I was vaccinated [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1225.76s)]
*  They hit me back. They're like, yeah, this is bullshit. And I was like, all right. I gotta talk to that guy [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1230.96s)]
*  It was [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1234.96s)]
*  I'm shocked [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1236.24s)]
*  What did he shoot me up with? [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1237.9199999999998s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, so you got the first two shots but nothing more [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1239.4399999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I was excited like I know this sounds crazy [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1242.32s)]
*  But I was like excited to get the first two because I was like I just want to get out like I want to party [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1244.08s)]
*  Like I like I didn't know what the fuck it was. We were in New York. We went down to Miami [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1248.0s)]
*  Okay, so we were in New York and everything was shut down New York and in the beginning [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1251.76s)]
*  It was kind of exciting. It was just me and my wife were like making fucking meals together every single night [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1256.56s)]
*  You know, it's felt like camping though. I've never gone camping but like that's kind of what I imagined it was and then [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1261.76s)]
*  And I was lucky. I'm doing podcasts. I'm doing what I do outside of stand-up [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1266.96s)]
*  Yeah, so like my life wasn't that different outside of like not being able to eat out I guess yeah [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1270.3999999999999s)]
*  Come winter it got brutal [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1277.4399999999998s)]
*  Like it was just so we went down to Miami for four months and it was amazing like my whole team [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1279.6799999999998s)]
*  We all went down there. I think day two the entire team got covid [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1284.6399999999999s)]
*  Yeah, of course higher team. My poor guy was in our pool house for two weeks with kovac. He got long covid [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1288.56s)]
*  Like it was yeah, I mean it was great. I was I just see him in the window just waving [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1294.3999999999999s)]
*  It was incredible duff who's here right now, but um [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1299.3600000000001s)]
*  But yeah. Yeah, so there was this part of me that was like I just want to be able to do things [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1303.1200000000001s)]
*  Like so shoot me up. I don't care and they were nazis in new york about it, which is your real home base [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1306.32s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, it is tricky. Do you like so there is this thing where I go? [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1310.64s)]
*  Yeah, we're gonna be more strict in new york where we live on top of each other [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1315.52s)]
*  We're all on the fucking subway together [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1318.48s)]
*  Like I don't want to compare new york to montana like when someone in montana is like I can't believe you guys did that [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1320.08s)]
*  In new york. It's like yeah, you live on a ranch. Yeah, like [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1324.64s)]
*  500 acres. Yeah, like the rules are gonna be different [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1327.6799999999998s)]
*  You know [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1330.3999999999999s)]
*  I got like a dominican family above me that's gonna play music at 12 unless the city has a rule [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1330.6399999999999s)]
*  That stops the music attack. That's right [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1335.6799999999998s)]
*  So sometimes you like a little government overreach if you want to get to bed, you know [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1337.28s)]
*  And we were all being told at the on the initial vaccine that it would stop the spread [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1341.28s)]
*  So, you know exactly make you not contagious. This is what I feel like people do that's just like so frustrating. It's like [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1346.08s)]
*  They it's the lies to cover up the lack of information [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1352.56s)]
*  And then you get these like conspiracies like every conspiracy. I imagine like the truth of it is probably way more boring [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1357.52s)]
*  But it's probably like a little incompetence. Yeah, somebody refusing to take accountability for their own incompetence [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1363.76s)]
*  Covering it up with a lie [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1369.9199999999998s)]
*  And then the internet gets after trying to solve this puzzle and it's just if one person had the balls to just be like [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1371.6s)]
*  Yo, I fucked up. Yeah, that was me. I was the second shooter [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1377.6s)]
*  I'm just gonna put it out there. We need the victoria secret guy. Who's epstein's? [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1381.14s)]

*  Give him immunity. Yeah, and then we can learn everything and we can move on. Yeah, but he's got to know [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1401.38s)]
*  Why'd you give this guy billions of dollars to manage I have to tell you I I had [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1407.7s)]
*  A couple of conversation with somebody very close to the epstein case like very close to it [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1412.74s)]
*  Who shall go nameless for this conversation and this person swore to me acosta? [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1418.66s)]
*  No that there's [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1423.7800000000002s)]
*  That there's a talk too. He knows shit too that that he [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1425.22s)]
*  Wasn't this quote? [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1429.7800000000002s)]
*  Right that he was into like [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1432.16s)]
*  1617 year old girls. Yeah, and that yes some may have sort of gotten through that were slightly younger [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1434.78s)]
*  but that wasn't exactly his thing and that [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1440.88s)]
*  Pretty much every famous celebrity was friends with him and went on his jet [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1445.2s)]

*  You are making dollars and cents business that you can cash out like I mean [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1622.64s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think that you can have this like pious constitution and do that [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1627.84s)]
*  Most of these people cash out and they they sell like mark cuban, you know [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1632.0s)]
*  He sold this business he came up with and there's just the one sale because it seems like the first buyer winds up getting screwed [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1635.76s)]
*  Like he thinks he's going to build it [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1642.24s)]

*  Tweet out something like two things elon has a suit and a babysitter [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1662.88s)]
*  We haven't seen it he's turning over a new leaf, you know what the thing about elon is is like [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1669.52s)]
*  He's obviously a brilliant guy and you want brilliant people on your side [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1674.16s)]
*  Especially if like we're going to world war three like if we are going to go to war with russia china, whatever it is [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1677.92s)]

*  My concern about the doge thing is this is I don't think there's a single american out there. That's like I want waste [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1695.3600000000001s)]
*  Inefficiency and government corruption, right? This is a bipartisan supported issue [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1701.2800000000002s)]
*  and I feel like because maybe he's [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1706.24s)]
*  He hasn't developed like the the the skill of politics [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1709.2800000000002s)]
*  He's kind of like twisting the knife a little bit and it's like too inhumane [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1713.2s)]
*  I don't even know about it inhumane. I'm just like it's kind of like gotcha [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1717.76s)]
*  Here we go where you could rally support from all of us. Everybody wants this [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1721.44s)]
*  The left should want this the right should want this [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1725.8400000000001s)]
*  The right should want this [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1728.32s)]
*  The right should want this [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1731.76s)]
*  This can be a victory for america I think it is I mean like do we have you guys we have that harry anton thing [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1734.96s)]
*  I asked for you know him over on cnn. He's hilarious. I know him from the cellar. He hangs out with the comedy [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1739.76s)]
*  All right. Oh, he does. Yeah. Yeah, he is. He's funny himself. I love his new york accent here [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1744.56s)]
*  He is talking about the the doge and the public reaction [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1749.12s)]
*  This to me was one of the more shocking figures that I saw made me go wait a minute. Hold on one second [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1752.48s)]
*  Spending and operations look at this 54 the majority say that he and they should [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1758.0s)]
*  How about a proof of trump trying to cut staff at government agencies again? You get a majority here 51 [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1763.28s)]
*  So yeah, ilan must might not be that popular [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1768.88s)]
*  But these cuts and the idea of spending cuts at least within the federal government and cutting at government agencies [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1771.44s)]
*  That actually has majority support. I was truly surprised by this tape [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1777.12s)]
*  But the numbers are the numbers i think democrats want to argue that the type of spending that must is cutting is mainly [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1780.48s)]
*  Necessary programs but that comes in at just 36 percent the wasteful spending actually wins the plurality here at 42 percent according to a recent washington [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1786.38s)]
*  Post ipso's paul and I think that is the reason why you see that when it comes to dusk and mose [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1795.0400000000002s)]
*  Musk and doge you see in fact the majority believe he should have some influence because they believe the plurality believe that he is cutting [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1799.92s)]
*  Wasteful spending not necessary programs that democrats are arguing [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1806.72s)]
*  So he is winning the pr war [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1811.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but to me there shouldn't even need to be pr [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1813.84s)]
*  I guess it should be 100 what what how so like he should be more clear on the doge website [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1817.52s)]
*  Which is not that user-friendly [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1821.6s)]
*  Yeah, I don't even know if it's more clear [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1823.28s)]
*  I think it's more like the tweets and like the antagonism within the tweets and I think he's developed this very like polarizing personality online [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1824.56s)]
*  And there's a way okay. The question right now is is it possible to be less polarizing right? [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1832.24s)]
*  Like what percentage no matter who you are, of course [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1837.12s)]
*  And like now that he's in this position of it's not only like immense power but also influence [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1839.6s)]
*  And he's tackling a topic that is not partisan at all like there is support here [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1845.9199999999998s)]
*  So you don't need to antagonize at all buddy. Everybody's on your side [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1852.0s)]
*  If you hire some people and then sorry if you fire them and then have to hire them back like it's okay to be like [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1855.6s)]
*  Hey, we made a mistake there. We're not perfect. We're gonna we're gonna do this right and we're gonna figure this out [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1860.4799999999998s)]
*  like it's okay to acknowledge these things and [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1865.6799999999998s)]
*  This is where I think like having a little bit more experience [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1869.1200000000001s)]
*  In politics can be helpful because this is it is a different game. You're doing dealing with emotions not facts [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1872.48s)]
*  Yeah, you could show me those lists all you want like people are emotional beings. They don't give a fuck [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1878.32s)]
*  like what is it that dweeb says all the time the ben shapiro guy is like, uh, [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1881.76s)]
*  Facts don't care about your feelings. It's like no no no dumbass [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1886.16s)]
*  Feelings don't care about facts [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1890.08s)]
*  We feel things like there's a woman in mexico that's going to see the virgin mary in her toast today [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1893.04s)]
*  Yeah, because she feels the lord and then sees it afterwards. We don't look at like usually it's a cinnabon [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=1899.04s)]

*  You know, well, yeah like but because like [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2108.88s)]
*  There's a competitive advantage about not caring about people but the human experience is connectivity [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2112.08s)]
*  so like [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2117.6s)]

*  Because you want people that can make those really difficult decisions and i'm sure the cia is all there whatever right anyway, and um [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2126.4s)]
*  He was telling me that like [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2133.28s)]
*  He he's aware of what people should feel. Yeah, even though he doesn't feel it. No, they study [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2135.76s)]
*  Yeah, they learn the proper way of reacting [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2141.68s)]

*  What a horrible way to live. Can I tell you something? I can find out whether you are a sociopath [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2157.92s)]
*  Oh, tell me two minutes or less. Go go. Go. This is good [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2162.56s)]
*  It's a little riddle. Okay, go. Okay [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2166.7200000000003s)]
*  A man shows up at a funeral. Yeah [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2169.6800000000003s)]
*  He goes to grieve the dead body at the wake it was the week [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2172.7200000000003s)]
*  And he sees a woman near the casket and they exchange a glance, you know, they make eye contact [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2176.96s)]
*  The man leaves the funeral wraps up a week later that man kills that woman's mother [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2184.96s)]
*  Why? [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2192.0800000000004s)]
*  Um [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2195.44s)]
*  Because he's a sociopath [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2198.8s)]
*  Well, I probably do have the answer but uh, what do you think the answer is because that woman's mother [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2201.2000000000003s)]
*  Uh was the mistress of his father. You're not a sociopath. Oh, wow. What is it? [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2207.52s)]
*  Because he wanted to see her again [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2214.1600000000003s)]
*  the woman [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2216.7200000000003s)]
*  Now let me tell you something did you see how I went with women cheating but can I tell you everybody's my biggest fear [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2219.52s)]
*  No, so so the sociopath gets that like this wait really they have that answer like this and let me tell you where I got [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2225.92s)]
*  This test from my somebody who used to be in my life [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2232.64s)]
*  um [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2236.7200000000003s)]
*  That person's father was a psychiatrist in one of the worst prisons in america and they would actually do this test [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2237.6s)]
*  on the patients [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2245.6s)]
*  And man by man by man if and by the way to my listening audience if it came to you right away [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2247.36s)]
*  You might be a sociopath. Yeah, turn yourself in but you'll see it has to come like if you're wrestling with it [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2252.24s)]
*  And after like a minute you're like was it this you've given a couple guesses and you get there eventually you're good [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2256.24s)]
*  Because a sociopath immediately is like because he wanted to see her again [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2260.7999999999997s)]
*  They just think differently. I mean it is the it is the easiest path to seeing her again, right? [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2265.04s)]
*  It guarantees it and there's no moral objection on your list again. You're like who cares? [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2271.12s)]
*  Isn't that crazy? That feels good that i'm not a sociopath. Yes, you can go tell emma [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2276.64s)]
*  Yes, I know but I knew you were in in my head while I was like should I do the sociopath test on him? [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2280.24s)]
*  I was like what if he fails and i've humiliated this poor guy in front of everybody [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2284.72s)]
*  But then I was thinking about the video you put in your latest comedy thing on netflix. I'm like there's no way [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2288.64s)]
*  You know, like an sociopath. What's the yeah, the opposite is empath. Yeah. Yeah, I think that's it. I'm like you feel too much [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2293.28s)]
*  Yeah, I believe that about you. Yeah, you are a softy. Yeah, i'm sensitive. Yeah, I can see that and it's like [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2299.12s)]
*  It's weird it's like i'm sensitive but like I can I can i'm numb to certain things [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2306.32s)]
*  Not numb, but like they don't really affect me like criticism going through all these like random internet shit that I go through. Yeah, but um [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2310.88s)]
*  I'm I am very sensitive to the people I really care about so like reactivity within like my family or friend group [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2317.76s)]
*  uh [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2324.88s)]
*  And then i'm also sensitive to like kind of like cultural trends. I can like feel like frustration pretty early [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2325.68s)]
*  Like what do you mean do you feel one now? [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2331.68s)]
*  No, not even like like what do I think for people for example, like what I think people really care about [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2333.76s)]
*  um [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2339.76s)]
*  Like I think that the democrats for example, like they could win the next election if they just make it a class issue [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2341.68s)]
*  Like it's that simple and they gotta just be [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2347.76s)]
*  They're not they're so risk averse and they need to be a little bit more brave americans [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2350.7200000000003s)]
*  We have very high risk tolerance or low risk. What's the one i'm trying? We have high risk high like everybody in our family [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2355.04s)]

*  So we like people that take risks and we like bravery and despite your politics [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2376.56s)]
*  We react to those type of people and like I think this is part of the reason why bernie was so successful [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=2381.76s)]

*  Yeah, did you did you run it by her first so the the thing was is uh, yeah at first like, you know [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3158.3999999999996s)]
*  This is the most like male thing like but it's I assume that the reason why we couldn't is because it was her fault [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3164.64s)]
*  Right and I talk about it in the special where i'm like she was really concerned [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3170.72s)]
*  It was her fault and I was really concerned. It was her fault. Like we were all really concerned [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3174.16s)]
*  Obviously her fault. Yeah, because like men we have this like confidence in our sperm that like there's no real reason why but we just [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3177.52s)]
*  Know right like every time i've ever had sex with a girl. I was like, oh my god, this is gonna be great [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3184.48s)]
*  Like what should we do? How do we you know calling the next month? I know she's pregnant guaranteed [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3189.2000000000003s)]
*  Which I now know is a waste and uh, once we found out that her ovaries were perfect and my sperm was horrible [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3194.56s)]
*  Um, it actually made it a lot easier for me to talk about really [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3200.8s)]
*  Yeah, because I think the reason why like anybody who has fertility issues one [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3205.12s)]
*  It's very isolating because you're so protective of the person that you love [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3208.88s)]
*  That you don't a lot of women feel a lot of shame around this. Yep, true [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3212.96s)]
*  And uh at first I I felt like real shame [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3216.56s)]
*  I was like does god not want me to have a child like I was like I didn't understand it [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3219.12s)]
*  like I think i'm like a pretty good person and i'm kind to people and i'm like [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3222.88s)]
*  Why is this happening? Like what the fuck is going on? [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3226.08s)]
*  and um [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3228.64s)]
*  Yeah, so I get that and a lot of women if they are struggling they're just like it they feel like it's a [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3230.0s)]
*  I don't feel very stigmatized, right? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3235.36s)]
*  And um, but once she was perfect and I was fucked up I could get on stage and I was really cathartic to talk about it [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3237.44s)]
*  And then once I started talking about it [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3244.32s)]
*  I literally thought that I was like [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3247.04s)]
*  This was like a one in like 10 million thing. Oh, wow [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3249.2000000000003s)]
*  The same I started talking about all my friends start telling me that they're doing ivf. Oh, wow [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3252.88s)]
*  And like all these people in the audience would hit me up afterwards. They're like, oh, yeah, you know same thing happened [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3256.96s)]
*  And I was like, what the fuck is this like the last taboo subject? [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3261.52s)]
*  How did anybody ever get pregnant before ivf because everybody's doing it dude [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3265.44s)]
*  It is like it's unbelievable. It's it's almost like [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3269.36s)]
*  I was like [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3273.6000000000004s)]
*  Does anybody really get abortion like i'd like i think it's so hard to get pregnant. Why is this an issue like [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3274.8s)]
*  Like how often do these athletes have unprotected sex that they have 20 kids like like [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3280.6400000000003s)]
*  I couldn't believe it. It was unfathomable [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3286.96s)]
*  So, um, but then it became like yeah, they're as brutal as it was [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3288.96s)]
*  There was these kind of funny moments that being one of them. Yeah that that [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3292.24s)]
*  The humility going into the room with the lady [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3296.16s)]
*  Oh, we just talked to the audience [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3298.9599999999996s)]
*  You know doug came in to say hi to andrew in the commercial break and uh, [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3300.24s)]

*  Yes, and they don't really want it to be 46 or 44 because you need the amount of time to build up the new batch [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3479.84s)]

*  sort of definitely hardest thing we went through and um [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3530.0s)]
*  but after the fact [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3533.36s)]
*  It is hysterical. Yes [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3535.44s)]
*  Like there's believe what you've been through [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3537.76s)]
*  Yeah [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3539.6s)]
*  And like there are so many of these things that are so funny and the beautiful thing about having a child is you get this? [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3539.92s)]
*  Like amnesia. Yeah for what you went through to get there [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3544.96s)]
*  I think that's actually kind of like built into our dna so we keep making them. I totally agree [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3548.32s)]
*  You know same women have been saying that for eons because of the pain of labor and it's so, you know [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3552.56s)]
*  Devastating and then you forget all about it. I never had labor because I had three c-sections [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3559.34s)]
*  But yeah, my friends tell me it's extremely painful [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3563.28s)]
*  Oh my what the emma was in there for 24 hours and then she had the c-section because the uh, the baby's heart rate dropped [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3565.92s)]
*  Oh god, that's scary. Yeah, the whole thing is is is terrible when you were doing the shots [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3571.0400000000004s)]
*  Before to prepare for the ivf like did you have any fun? Uh, [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3575.6000000000004s)]
*  Mood swings or anything. Oh, yeah, I was actually fine. I I did not have weird mood swings [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3578.96s)]
*  but it was very funny because doug does not like he [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3584.4s)]
*  His mom got this terrible cut in her leg and it was so brutal and doug was right there [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3588.32s)]
*  He bandaged it up. He put the medicine. I was like, yeah [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3592.48s)]
*  I can't take that kind of injury. Yeah, but you pull out a needle and doug is one of those like [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3596.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh, so he so he can't do shots. But he had to in the beginning as it turned out [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3602.08s)]
*  He didn't have to but we thought he did. Yeah [[01:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3606.48s)]
*  Because in the beginning they really make it up into a thing like you got to mix the compound and it's like kind [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3608.96s)]
*  Of back in a hard spot to reach. Yeah, you got to ice the area. Oh my god [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3612.64s)]
*  I like our future family depends on this [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3616.08s)]
*  Yeah, and doug was in a hot like a cold sweat and the superintendent of our building at the time [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3618.3199999999997s)]
*  His name was lance and they're like it's very important that your wife have a partner that helps her then and doug is like [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3623.44s)]
*  This is gonna be very hard for lance. Yeah [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3627.7599999999998s)]
*  But he did it he did it he got it through but honestly by the third child, you know [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3632.08s)]
*  He doug was no part of it. I was like, I need no ice. I'm good boom. We're done [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3637.12s)]
*  Yeah after the race it is crazy that they make you mix it at home. So anybody who's not familiar they give you these two [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3641.68s)]
*  Uh, I guess hormonal compounds and you have to put them together in the syringe in just the right proportions [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3647.6s)]
*  I'm like, why isn't this done at the lab? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3655.12s)]
*  And then we just hit it like you don't have to make the kitkat, right? [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3656.96s)]
*  Like make the bar and then send it to me [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3660.4s)]
*  And I remember like watching my wife do these things making sure it's the right amount [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3662.88s)]
*  You got to push a little out so no air gets in there, right? [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3666.48s)]
*  Right, so you don't give yourself an air bubble like life or death literally and she's like did I push too much out? [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3669.12s)]
*  Will I not get it? Is this [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3674.32s)]
*  But they're yeah, they're I mean emma would get like it would really get her going [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3676.88s)]
*  I should get angry or just overly emotional angry like [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3680.8s)]
*  But we didn't know that that was the cause [[01:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3684.56s)]
*  So like I remember we got into it at a japanese restaurant [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3687.44s)]
*  You don't realize how quiet those restaurants are until you're having like a loud blow up with like [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3690.7200000000003s)]
*  And you know the only thing interrupting the blow up because everybody is already quiet a japanese restaurant [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3695.44s)]
*  And then once you have like a verbal altercation, they're really quiet [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3700.88s)]
*  Oh, I love when somebody has a fight and i'm nearby [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3704.96s)]
*  Oh my god, doug and I like he'll start talking. I'll be quiet. This is too important to me [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3707.6s)]
*  Everybody was locked in they're just slurping udon and watching us [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3711.92s)]
*  And the only thing that would interrupt it is like when a new person would walk in and you know [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3714.8s)]
*  The whole restaurant has to go [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3718.48s)]
*  Emma would feel like they were interrupting [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3723.04s)]
*  Our argument so so so we're fighting. I see my say Emma goes. Are you kidding me? And then back to yelling at me? [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3726.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just amazing [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3733.36s)]
*  Well, weren't you so you weren't that guy who was like she's going through a lot. These are just her emotions [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3734.88s)]
*  I'm just gonna i'm gonna let everything slide. I'm not gonna get mad about anything. We didn't know that it was the case [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3739.04s)]
*  So we didn't know until literally that night [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3745.04s)]
*  I go hey, did we do the shot? We did the shot today, right? And she goes, oh shit [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3747.84s)]
*  We're walking down we were on kenmare street. That's when you put it together that she's hormonal [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3752.2400000000002s)]
*  And then and then she was also like, oh fuck. I guess i'm like really reactive to this [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3756.5600000000004s)]
*  And then from then on we stop going to japanese restaurants [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3762.08s)]
*  And then how about after she had the baby did she have like because you're sleep deprived [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3764.72s)]
*  You're very hormonal. It's the most insane thing if you're did you breastfeed? Yeah. Okay, that is the [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3769.36s)]
*  I think that [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3775.68s)]
*  This is I think that is the most difficult part [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3777.28s)]
*  of child rearing [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3781.2s)]
*  Is the the if you are breastfeeding full-time like meaning every two hours. Yeah [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3782.88s)]
*  That is insane. Yeah, it's a lot [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3789.04s)]
*  That is insane [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3791.6s)]
*  Every two hours so you're waking up. I don't think a lot of people know this [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3793.2799999999997s)]
*  You're waking up every two hours in the night. You don't get more than an hour of sleep at a time [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3797.44s)]
*  It's truly like a like an astronaut training situation [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3802.0s)]
*  Yeah [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3805.12s)]
*  No, it's brutal. But then that it [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3806.0s)]
*  It lets up a little when it lets up this is beautiful bonding experience that you have with your child and like it's something even now [[01:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3809.04s)]
*  Like Emma's still breastfeeding and it's just this thing that she's like she doesn't even want to let go of it [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3814.8s)]
*  Yeah [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3819.84s)]
*  Well, then you get to like the six month mark where the baby can start having like smaller like solid foods [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3820.4s)]
*  Yeah [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3825.04s)]
*  And they're still having breast milk and you're at the point now where like you're you're producing the more more milk than ever [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3825.92s)]
*  And yet the baby's somewhat getting a little independent. Yep, and the weight comes shredding off [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3831.52s)]
*  That's the best moment where you're like, i'm making tons of milk. All these calories are coming off for free [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3836.7200000000003s)]
*  Oh because your body is burning calories [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3843.2799999999997s)]
*  But your your baby doesn't need as much milk as [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3845.36s)]
*  From you right as he needed it five months because now he's starting to eat food [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3848.08s)]
*  But your body doesn't know that so it's still burning like 800 calories a day. You're like, oh my god. I'm out of a waste again [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3851.92s)]
*  Yeah, there's a normal ass [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3858.48s)]
*  Thank you, sweet baby [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3861.2799999999997s)]
*  I always say they're selling breastfeeding moms all wrong that you would care about the hell of our babies [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3863.52s)]
*  But we know that babies who are formula fed are fine, too [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3867.36s)]
*  You have to sell it to them like ozempic. You'll be skinny. Yes, it is natural ozempic. It's natural ozempic [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3870.08s)]
*  Let that baby suck the fat out of you [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3875.28s)]
*  They put it on you it's the least they can do that is their gift. Yes. Wow, that is so true [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3878.08s)]
*  Yeah, Emma really got her shit back. Yeah, it was like well your baby's only like one now, right? [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3882.96s)]
*  Yeah, yeah 13 months. So now is it is it kicking in now? Like that's usually when you're like, what about number two? [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3886.88s)]
*  Let's let's go gonna fire up the machines again. Literally. She was like do you want to do it this month? [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3893.44s)]
*  And I was like, can I just get the special out? Can I get let's get the special out [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3897.92s)]
*  Let's do like a weekend somewhere. This has been like three years in the making [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3901.6s)]
*  Yes between like making a baby and also, you know making the special and like let's just take a let's just take a little vacation [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3904.96s)]
*  And you've probably been told this but you know, like the difference between one and two [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3911.76s)]
*  Is large wait, tell me what do you mean? Like [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3916.88s)]
*  Your relationship with them or no. Yeah. No when you just have one baby like in the beginning [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3919.6800000000003s)]
*  You're overwhelmed as you know, but like by year one you kind of got it down [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3923.28s)]
*  Oh, yeah, and things are you know, you can still have a life. Yeah [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3925.84s)]
*  You can still take a nap you and emma can still steal away for like an hour in the middle of the day [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3929.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, while your one baby is asleep or somebody else would easily watch your one baby [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3934.0800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, but when you have two babies, like under the age of three, you're effed. There's no napping ever [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3938.96s)]
*  There's no downtime. This is where you really start thinking about having live in yeah help like yeah who can come live with us? [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3946.0s)]
*  What about so I can sleep again? [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3952.5600000000004s)]
*  I don't even remember three [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3954.7999999999997s)]
*  It's like all a blur [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3956.08s)]
*  But I I felt the difference from one to two was much larger than from two to three [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3957.04s)]
*  Like you you've given up your free time when you have to got it got it [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=3961.12s)]

*  It was just just a day trip. Yeah, and it was the first time i'd been alone for like 12 hours with both of them [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4008.72s)]
*  Without doug being there [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4015.7599999999998s)]
*  I'm like i'm good. I'm fine. Like I had a newborn and a two-year-old and like honey. I'm trust me [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4017.6s)]
*  I'm i'm the mother i've got this [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4023.12s)]
*  and um [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4025.36s)]
*  So I was pushing it was late in the day things hadn't gone that smoothly [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4026.56s)]
*  I'm not gonna lie and I took them out for a walk and I was pushing the baby in her stroller and my two-year-old was like [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4029.52s)]
*  Walking next to me earlier. He was on like that little ride-on thing that you can put on your stroller like on his feet [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4035.2s)]
*  And uh, he had this thing where he loved to take off [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4040.64s)]
*  So we're i'm pushing the baby up a hill and he's on the little ride-on thing standing there and doug [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4043.8399999999997s)]
*  Turns the corner in his car coming home just at that moment, right? So he sees the whole thing [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4050.3199999999997s)]
*  So at this moment yates our oldest did not see doug. He was just doing his thing [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4055.04s)]
*  He takes off running and there's a massive street straight ahead to to which he's running [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4058.96s)]
*  And I can't just let go of the baby stroller because i'm on an incline like if I let go of the baby stroller [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4064.08s)]
*  She's gonna go. Yeah, but he's running toward traffic the other way [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4068.72s)]
*  So all this is happening and there's doug and he he kind of does the gentle beep and waves and I was like [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4071.92s)]
*  Oh, oh hi [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4077.2s)]
*  Oh [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4079.6s)]
*  Trying to rescue the toddler i'm like I got it all under control [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4085.6s)]
*  No, he knew it wasn't true. Yeah, you just got it. The whole thing is so humbling, isn't it? [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4090.3999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, as you add more and as they get older into the toddler years even more so it is amazingly humbling [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4094.8799999999997s)]
*  That's the best way to describe it all of it, right? You don't know anything. You know nothing [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4100.72s)]
*  It's crazy to even give you the baby [[01:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4105.12s)]
*  I remember when they first gave us the baby to leave the hospital. I was like, how is this legal? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4106.56s)]
*  Isn't there someone more qualified? We are we're not professionals at all. Like they just give you like here's how you wrap it [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4110.88s)]
*  All right. Have a good good luck at home, right? [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4116.4800000000005s)]
*  I mean, it's just so do you do are you an involved dad? Do you change diapers? Oh, yeah [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4118.88s)]
*  Yeah, I feel like you can't you can't really have an opinion on how it's raised if you're not doing [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4122.88s)]
*  Some of the things like obviously i'm at work, you know, yeah, so like emma [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4128.8s)]
*  This was actually really hard for her. I wonder if you felt this way at all, but like, uh, you know my wife [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4134.0s)]
*  Oh, there you are. He's my little shy. She's so cute. Yeah, so so emma's like, uh, she's you know [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4139.28s)]
*  Very like successful in her own right like she got her mba and then she was working and managing ai [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4145.12s)]
*  Uh projects for apple and then she was like, I don't really want to do this [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4151.2s)]
*  I want to be a mom and I feel a little guilty even saying that but that is the true thing that I want to [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4155.12s)]
*  Do with my life like it's always been my dream to be a mom and I was like listen if you want to do it [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4159.599999999999s)]
*  don't do it because I said it because [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4164.32s)]
*  Then you'll resent me if you realize that you wish you never should have quit your job [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4166.4s)]
*  Yeah, but if you want to do it then go for it [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4171.44s)]
*  And uh, it was like interesting watching her like grapple with that [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4174.32s)]
*  And that's something that I hope changes in the very near future. I think it's starting to yeah [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4178.32s)]
*  Like I think that we should reward [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4184.08s)]
*  Mothers that stay at home in the same way that we reward mothers that go work and and value and talk about yeah [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4186.96s)]
*  Yeah, I I feel like republicans are are way ahead on that democrats. I don't think they're there. Yeah, maybe not [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4194.32s)]
*  I mean, it's just like [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4200.8s)]
*  When you go to certain countries that like value [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4202.5599999999995s)]
*  I think it's also like a big city thing where there's not a lot of like family built into it [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4204.64s)]
*  I grew up in new york city and it was very rare that there were like families there and um, [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4208.96s)]
*  So they're just the idea of it like a kid crying on the subway can be like bothersome to some people [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4214.0s)]
*  And whereas like once you have kids you see a kid crying you're like, oh, it's adorable [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4218.88s)]
*  I know bad for the parents, but I hope that as the pendulum continues to swing [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4222.32s)]
*  with [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4228.08s)]
*  Feminism or masculinity or whatever these things are [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4229.58s)]
*  I hope that there is this place for moms that stay home and it is a privilege [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4233.5199999999995s)]
*  But that they don't feel this kind of scrutiny [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4238.88s)]
*  I think it's like a really beautiful thing if you can afford it to do [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4241.04s)]
*  Yeah, I couldn't agree more and also for guys who are sensitive and empathic. Yeah, but [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4244.4s)]
*  Not man buns and mandels mersed toting. I don't get about like the masculinity movement right now [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4250.48s)]
*  It's like a lot of these guys like at the at the forefront of it like don't even aren't even dads [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4256.24s)]
*  Yeah, so it's like yeah. Okay. You got like you could deadlift like [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4261.759999999999s)]
*  or some are just like [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4266.32s)]
*  You know or deadbeat dads because I was gonna say they're producing children, but they're not even looking after [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4268.24s)]
*  It's like why are you why do you get to decide what masculinity is? [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4272.88s)]
*  Like I think that's like the least masculine thing you can do. That's like a coward. That's right [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4275.76s)]
*  I was talking to rogan about this. He says listen [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4279.2s)]
*  There's a lot of bitches out there and even bitches need a leader of the bitches [[01:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4280.8s)]
*  and I think sometimes we're [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4284.639999999999s)]
*  Mistaking them for like being masculine guys [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4286.94s)]
*  It's like having muscles doesn't make you masculine like to me being involved in your kid's life [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4290.0s)]
*  Is masculine what I mean what tough guy ever tells you how tough he is [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4294.48s)]
*  They don't they don't talk about that exactly like the greatest of all like michael jordan never said he was the greatest [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4298.4s)]
*  He didn't need to we knew right so like when I see like involved parents [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4303.52s)]
*  Like one of the most beautiful things about this whole process even talking about these things is like seeing how much [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4307.92s)]
*  People love their children and like feeling really comfortable sharing that and they'll share these [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4313.6s)]
*  Stories about when they first had their kid and like seeing dads [[01:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4318.32s)]
*  I mean this guy who's driving me and when I was in austin recently [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4321.919999999999s)]
*  He was telling me about how he does this like daddy daughter dates [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4324.639999999999s)]
*  He has these two daughters and they each get a different day and like [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4326.96s)]
*  That's the shit [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4330.08s)]
*  I would like to see promoted a little bit more in the masculinity movement in america [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4330.719999999999s)]
*  Like don't tell me like how much time that you could like jog [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4335.04s)]
*  Yeah, you know, I don't care how many miles you could run how much money you have in the bank [[01:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4340.32s)]
*  Yeah, like I don't give a fuck. They don't give I'll tell you one thing. They don't your daughter don't care [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4343.839999999999s)]
*  Well, you do a very funny bit in life about how you you have there's so much pressure of being a dad to a daughter [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4348.32s)]
*  Because one wrong move and she's on only fans. Yeah, and it's your fault. You missed a volleyball game [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4355.68s)]
*  It's and it's your it's daddy. Like there's no such thing as mommy issues. Oh, we have that. Okay, let's watch that [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4360.24s)]
*  That's so funny. It's hot. I have a screenshot of the moment. I found out that I was gonna have a daughter if you want to see [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4365.2s)]
*  stress [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4371.44s)]
*  If you want to see pressure put that shit up [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4373.12s)]
*  that's [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4376.08s)]
*  That's a real picture [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4378.48s)]
*  This is the pressure of knowing no matter what happens to your daughter is dad's fault. I miss one volleyball game [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4380.639999999999s)]
*  She starts an only fans. It's my fault [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4386.88s)]
*  You're not wrong [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4393.76s)]
*  Daddy issues is a thing. What's mommy issues? No, it's not really I mean it can happen [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4394.96s)]
*  But what is it? It's not as much of a phrase. We don't even know what it is [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4399.76s)]
*  Like there's no like if a kid shoots up a school, we don't go on mommy issues [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4403.28s)]
*  No, it's more like he can't leave his mom. I that's what I attribute to me. That's awesome. Yeah [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4407.12s)]
*  Yeah, you're right. I did a good job being a mom [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4412.08s)]
*  Yeah [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4414.88s)]
*  Wow, your son loves you and has a deep connection to the most important human being in it [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4415.4400000000005s)]
*  Like that's a positive effect now you're terrified of making the wrong move [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4419.68s)]
*  Yeah, like I don't know [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4424.16s)]
*  I don't want like I I want my kids to be incredibly comfortable with their family not like [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4425.28s)]
*  Waiting to jump at the first person who's going to take them away [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4430.24s)]
*  You wouldn't find it empowering for your daughter to consider becoming a quote sex worker. Oh my god [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4433.12s)]
*  This is praised. Can we just call them whores? [[01:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4438.24s)]
*  Like I hate the fact that we're like making up these terms that make it seem more dignified. Right? It's whore, right? [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4440.56s)]
*  That's it. Well, what about that girl on only fans? [[01:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4448.16s)]
*  I don't know her name, but she's the one who had sex with like 100 people in a day and then like [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4450.56s)]
*  And she's now [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4455.360000000001s)]
*  Going on a tour of nursing homes [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4456.64s)]
*  Oh, that's cool. I like that [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4459.68s)]
*  I wondered how you're gonna react to that. I like it. I had a crazy thing. We do [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4461.68s)]
*  Oh, we actually my team is way ahead of me here. Here she is and sought 24. Her name is lily phillips [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4465.28s)]
*  Via facebook and when I asked for his address, he actually sent me the address of a care home [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4473.6s)]
*  So i'm actually here with him and his friends and i'm gonna show them a good time [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4479.92s)]
*  Oh [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4485.12s)]
*  So these they actually figured it out [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4488.08s)]
*  This is heroic [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4491.68s)]
*  I like that this no judgment. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, they figured it out [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4493.280000000001s)]
*  Those are sex workers. That's work [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4498.88s)]
*  That is no, no, no, no, no [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4501.280000000001s)]
*  This is I didn't know that they were doing this when they were doing those like, you know [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4502.64s)]
*  100 girls or that 100 dudes or thousand is whatever i'm like this is disgusting [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4506.4800000000005s)]
*  But but having sex with old guys in old people homes, yeah [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4510.56s)]
*  That is like [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4515.84s)]
*  That is altruism [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4517.4400000000005s)]
*  That is when we're talking about she showed my daughter. That's what she said. Yeah when she's ready. That is charity. That is beautiful [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4519.280000000001s)]
*  That is fucking beautiful. I feel so uncomfortable with it. Yeah, it's uncomfortable. Yes very but for not for them [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4525.84s)]
*  Those guys there. Oh, oh, they're so excited. What do you think like? [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4532.56s)]
*  You know could they could die [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4537.280000000001s)]
*  Happy, oh they'll die happy. They'll also just forget it and then the next day [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4539.84s)]
*  That's the sad part is they won't even remember it happened. Yeah, that's that's actually one of my favorite jokes [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4544.4800000000005s)]
*  I heard a long time ago, which was um [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4548.72s)]
*  like a 95 year old guy marries a 25 year old gal and goes to the doctor right before the wedding and he says [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4550.8s)]
*  Is there anything I need to know doc and the doc says yeah, you know [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4556.4800000000005s)]
*  You should know that sex at this point could be dangerous even lethal and he said if she dies she dies. That's great [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4559.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's a my dad is a dementia and which is you know, obviously very sad [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4565.84s)]
*  he's my hero and you know, he's he introduces me in the special and um, but like during this time where em and I were trying [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4570.56s)]
*  To get pregnant I would go over every week to see him and uh, he'd be like how's things going and i'm like, uh, [[01:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4576.24s)]
*  It's you know rough trying to get um [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4581.04s)]
*  I'm just trying to get pregnant. It's just not really going that well and he would go uh, he goes [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4583.28s)]
*  Well, if you need some help, you know, I could I can help you and he would forget that he would say the joke [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4587.360000000001s)]
*  every week [[01:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4592.88s)]
*  I would go over and he would offer to have sex with my wife and put a baby in her [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4594.64s)]
*  So this goes on for like six months [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4599.84s)]
*  So this is now what I will say is that might be like the negative side of dementia [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4603.4400000000005s)]
*  but one of the cool positives is um [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4608.64s)]
*  And you know life is about perspective right? You can have good perspective on even the worst things [[01:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4611.92s)]
*  Like he gets to find out he has a granddaughter [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4616.160000000001s)]
*  Every single time I see him. Is that right? [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4619.52s)]
*  Yeah, now sometimes he'll kind of remember sometimes it might not be there but like [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4622.4s)]
*  That must be a pretty cool feeling. Does he remember you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4626.4s)]
*  So his it's it's it's hard building new long-term memories [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4629.84s)]
*  Okay, like the way the memory is it works is there's like short term and long term and you can create new long-term memories just by [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4633.36s)]
*  continuous [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4639.18s)]
*  Efforts so like repeating the same thing over and over again with the table manners [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4640.32s)]
*  Exactly reinforcement reinforcement constant, but uh, but short term he doesn't really how old is he? He's 81 [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4644.4s)]
*  So, how long has he been dealing with this if [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4650.64s)]
*  Honestly, it started I think when I got out of college like even 20 years ago [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4653.04s)]
*  I started noticing these things like very small, but it was like, oh something's kind of up and then so does that [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4657.12s)]
*  Does that make you worry for yourself? Do you ever think about it? Anytime? I forget anything. I'm like I got it [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4664.24s)]
*  Yep, but I don't know if it you know exactly works like that. Right? I know [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4669.12s)]
*  I I have such a fear of this and my my mom doesn't have alzheimer's and my dad died too young for me to know [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4672.48s)]
*  You know me died at 45 of a heart attack [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4678.32s)]
*  But I worry about it so much because it's like it can happen to anybody [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4681.28s)]
*  And it can even if you're using your brain as you do for a living as I do for a living [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4685.28s)]
*  You're not immune. It's got sandra day o'connor who's like, I mean you're not there's nothing more intellectually [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4690.0s)]
*  Straining than being on the u.s. Supreme court. Yeah, so it's just so indiscriminate and it's terrifying to me some say diet [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4695.58s)]
*  Yep, diet. I could really impact and sleep every time I have a sleepless night [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4702.08s)]
*  I'm like, uh, it's over getting my early alleys. Yeah, it's coming on. Yeah, because you do you don't remember [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4706.16s)]
*  When you have a bad night's sleep, you don't remember that as well the next day [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4713.92s)]
*  I will say it it does kind of expose like your true character in a lot of times [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4716.4800000000005s)]
*  And uh, one of the cool rewarding things about it is just like seeing what like a good human my dad is [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4722.08s)]
*  I've always thought he's like this angel but like a truly just good kind human [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4728.16s)]
*  Like he was my mom had to take his like debit card because he would like give [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4733.599999999999s)]
*  Uh to people who sell the fruit in the neighborhood just money and forget he did it and then go back [[01:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4737.68s)]
*  Oh and keep giving his popular. Yeah, he's fucking assholes kept letting them give him. Oh, no, that's low [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4743.44s)]
*  Yeah, that is low. Yeah, so I made a call to trump and I was like we got some [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4748.32s)]
*  Speaking of having murdered people [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4754.96s)]
*  Exactly. Oh, that's I mean, that's good. You take care of him. You have a good perspective on it [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4756.8s)]
*  I always feel like if god forbid this happens to me, I said this to doug, you know [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4760.24s)]
*  Please make sure i'm sitting in a room with all my favorite movies just on loop [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4764.0s)]
*  Yep, and uh in my favorite audiobooks just playing on loop like I just keep enjoying these series over and over and over [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4768.0s)]
*  Yeah, i'm not sure that's exactly the way it works [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4773.44s)]
*  But that's how i'd like to believe it's gonna work it will but I don't think that I don't know [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4775.36s)]
*  Who knows what will happen? I hope it won't happen. But don't stress about it now [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4779.28s)]
*  I know you shouldn't plenty of time to stress about it later [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4782.48s)]
*  Well, the other thing is, you know, there's this is one of the things that rfkj's been talking about [[01:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4785.44s)]
*  You know, there's been such bullshit going on in the public health world for so long [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4790.0s)]
*  And we talked about this about this on our show four three years ago [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4794.24s)]
*  Where this massive thing came out with this guy committed fraud in saying they'd made this major breakthrough in alzheimer's [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4797.759999999999s)]
*  And that they'd really really zeroed in on the amyloid plaque. Yeah [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4804.16s)]
*  Yeah, and then it turned out he had been faking all the photos [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4807.84s)]
*  To show this and they'd been repeated and he was like the gold standard researcher in all this [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4811.28s)]
*  And now it's like it was alzheimer's research was set back by 15 [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4816.72s)]
*  20 years. It's one of the other reasons why I just feel so good [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4821.04s)]
*  We have people in there now who will not treat any of this prior bullshit as you know, godly and untouchable [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4824.08s)]
*  Yeah, you know jay bodhicharya who just took over at nih. He's being confirmed right now. His hearings are underway [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4831.5199999999995s)]
*  They were like so you're not going to go back and look at whether childhood vaccines are linked to autism, right? [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4838.32s)]
*  Those are well settled studies that it's there's no link whatsoever and to his credit. He was like [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4843.12s)]
*  Look, I understand there's been a lot of research on this [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4847.84s)]
*  But i'm not he basically said i'm not going to say never like I think yeah [[01:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4849.76s)]
*  There's nothing wrong with going back and looking and then revealing the science to everybody. I think I think that [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4852.96s)]
*  The most important thing that anybody that is representing a government institution can do right now [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4858.96s)]
*  Is be transparent about their failures and their successes [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4864.64s)]
*  So if going back and looking at the research and then presenting studies [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4868.879999999999s)]
*  Shows that there is no link [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4873.599999999999s)]
*  That's awesome. Yeah now I trust it coming from you. Yeah, i'm feeling concerned like I joke around all the time [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4875.759999999999s)]
*  Like I believe whatever the last youtube video I watched this that that is what I believe 100 percent [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4881.36s)]
*  I'm easily convinced like i'm locked in so [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4886.16s)]
*  If if you're if you're rfk if you're this guy, it's like just be transparent. Tell us where the fuck-ups were [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4889.839999999999s)]
*  Yeah, don't gaslight us because we've been gaslighted so gaslit so much that I feel like that [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4896.32s)]
*  It's completely dissolved our confidence and confidence in these institutions and in order to have like a proud american public [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4902.0s)]
*  We need something to be proud of [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4908.08s)]
*  We can be proud. We fuck up too. You can fuck up and we will forgive you [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4910.72s)]
*  Give us that opportunity. Yeah, but I cannot forgive you if you continue to lie to me [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4916.4s)]
*  That's right [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4920.56s)]
*  If you are not accountable for anything at all like and I think that's why Fauci he'll never be forgiven [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4921.44s)]
*  That's why he probably took the he took the what's it called? I am science the pardon [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4926.639999999999s)]
*  Yeah, it's like why do you even need to take the pardon? [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4930.5599999999995s)]
*  Yeah, meanwhile, I will say Elon's out there like we did screw up. We cancelled funding for ebola. Nobody likes ebola [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4932.48s)]
*  But you know that we're resuming that more of that. I love that like to me instead of [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4938.5599999999995s)]
*  Looking at that and hopefully the opposition or hopefully democrats don't use them to like see he's an asshole [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4942.96s)]
*  You should use that as an example of how you should conduct yourself in public. Hey, we messed up [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4948.0s)]
*  We're bringing it back. We're bringing those people back. It doesn't sound like trump to me [[01:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4954.0s)]
*  Trump refuses to ever do it. He is right. The first one on which he explained the weave [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4957.76s)]
*  Yeah, it was right. Yeah, that was an amazing sound bite. Oh, dude [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4963.12s)]
*  He was the I think the best moment of that whole thing to me was when he goes, uh, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4966.4s)]
*  i'm [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4972.08s)]
*  basically [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4972.9400000000005s)]
*  an honest person [[01:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4974.08s)]
*  And i'll never forget that I think about that once a day because it's actually the most honest thing you can say yeah [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4976.5599999999995s)]
*  If you everybody looked at that like see he's admitting he's a liar and it's like no, no, no, no, no [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4983.28s)]
*  A liar would say i'm an honest person. I never lie [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4988.96s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, meanwhile, I don't know if this is true, but they say like the average person lies something like 15 times a day [[01:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4993.28s)]
*  It's something ridiculous [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=4998.8s)]
*  But no, that was a great interview that you did with him. Thanks. We actually have a clip of it, right? [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5001.44s)]
*  Let's let's let's play it and we'll take a break. You know, I do a thing called the weave [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5005.36s)]

*  To why khanye likes apparently having his wives be naked in public like a lot. What did what did she say? [[01:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5538.66s)]

*  Honey, it's for sure. Drop the car like that [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5547.78s)]
*  Yeah, he did the same thing to me and kim [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5550.259999999999s)]
*  This is what is it? What is it about that that he wants the world to know? [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5552.74s)]
*  Look at my woman [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5556.74s)]
*  We can see he wants other men to want his woman that's what he's into he likes that [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5559.860000000001s)]
*  He likes he likes that men are like drooling over his woman [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5566.02s)]
*  That's what he's into. Yeah. He wants all his friends the one his girlfriend. He wants everybody that when you walk in a room [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5570.1s)]
*  That his girlfriend or wife is the most desirable in the room. She the baddest be in the room. That's what he likes. Yeah [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5577.3s)]
*  And she said he did it to me he did it to kim and he's doing it to bianca what do you make of that like [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5584.259999999999s)]
*  I don't that seems so odd to me to to want [[01:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5590.66s)]
*  To want everybody to admire a woman so much you you want her to go out naked in public [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5593.86s)]
*  Yeah, it makes me question like if he really likes her or if she's just a tool for his own validation right to get attention. Yeah [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5597.86s)]
*  Yeah, he's khanye's a uh [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5605.299999999999s)]
*  I'm just like exhausted by it to be honest like he's so exhausting [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5608.099999999999s)]
*  But he's so good at getting attention. Yeah, like i'll just be so annoyed by him [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5613.06s)]
*  And then he'll like tweet a couple things and i'll be like, holy shit [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5616.58s)]
*  You see how the porn he tweeted? No, super bowl weekend. Oh my god [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5619.06s)]
*  So all my all my friends were texting me like don't go on khanye's x feed, which of course you gotta do it [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5622.58s)]
*  You go immediately. What's he doing? Yeah, and I could not believe my eyes why he's actually posing porn porn [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5627.860000000001s)]
*  I don't think it was him. Yeah, it was a black man and a white woman in the videos without the faces in most of them [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5635.06s)]
*  So I not sure. Yeah [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5641.0599999999995s)]
*  But it was very graphic triple x porn. Yeah all over his x feed [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5643.62s)]
*  Yeah, and I was like, oh my god, right? [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5648.9s)]
*  So then I logged off of that and it wasn't until a couple hours later that I remembered to mention it to doug [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5650.82s)]
*  I'm like, yeah, I got kind of so he went back. It was still up. Yeah, like it hadn't been taken down [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5655.62s)]
*  That's not surprising to me because like there's a moment like the super bowl where [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5660.259999999999s)]
*  He knows that everybody's attention is going to be on somebody else. Oh, so he's like i'm gonna make this about me [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5664.419999999999s)]
*  That's interesting. Yeah, I think it's a constant like thirst and need for attention [[01:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5670.42s)]
*  I don't even know if he's aware of that. Do you think the hitler comments are coming from the same place? [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5674.26s)]
*  Yeah, it's the same thing as magga like when magga was that radioactive. He was like i'm gonna wear the magga hat [[01:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5678.1s)]
*  That's interesting. He takes the most disliked [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5684.740000000001s)]
*  Radioactive fucked up thing and he's like i'm so cool [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5687.84s)]
*  That I can make this cool and he's done that like throughout his life with fashion and you know [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5691.62s)]
*  Now he does it with like talking points and that kind of stuff [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5698.820000000001s)]
*  But it's I think just a reflection of like him thinking i'm still the man [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5701.14s)]
*  I could make [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5705.780000000001s)]
*  hitler the man or it's coming from this place of [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5706.9800000000005s)]
*  You're not going to tell me what I can or can't like yeah, I have total autonomy and freedom in my that I respect and like [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5711.780000000001s)]
*  Yeah, that I like it's just there's other ways to prove you're free. Right? [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5718.34s)]
*  Well, there are a lot of people like that in the public, you know [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5722.660000000001s)]
*  Conversation well, I would also go like are you really free? [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5725.62s)]
*  If you need to do that, right because now you're being controlled [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5728.820000000001s)]
*  The opposite well if you always have to do the most subversive thing the most controversial thing people that are truly free [[01:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5733.22s)]
*  Don't need that. Yeah, they feel the freedom [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5739.22s)]
*  So they don't need to execute it every second people who don't feel free need to constantly prove that they're free [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5741.9400000000005s)]
*  It's back to the old, you know, michael jordan didn't tell you what a great basketball player he was [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5747.62s)]
*  He was yeah like he knew he was it's I was actually with somebody from another sport [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5751.54s)]
*  Which I won't I won't reveal who it was because it would make it obvious [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5756.0199999999995s)]
*  But they were like i'm the goat everyone knows i'm the goat and I remember thinking [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5758.74s)]
*  I don't think the goat ever calls himself the goat. No, it's not a thing [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5762.18s)]
*  No, so you've got this very successful podcast now in addition to your comedy routines. Do you [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5766.26s)]
*  Like what do you do on that show? [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5771.54s)]
*  Is there are there any limits is there anything you do to make it a success? [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5773.14s)]
*  Somebody was just asking me this about my show and I was like, that's not how I approach it [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5776.66s)]
*  I just kind of do what I I just talk about what I want to talk about [[01:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5780.1s)]
*  Yeah [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5782.5s)]
*  Yeah, I talk about what I want to talk about and then like I try very hard to not let the algorithm dictate [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5782.9800000000005s)]
*  What we talk about? Yep, and I feel like a lot of times now [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5789.22s)]
*  There's a lot of creators that don't even realize that that algorithm is really dictating to them what they should create [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5792.1s)]
*  They'll post a video or cover a topic and it will go crazy and then they go [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5798.1s)]
*  Oh, I should cover that more and then you see people like lose their own personal creativity and they just become this slave to the algorithm [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5801.46s)]
*  Yes [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5808.98s)]
*  The problem is that when you're gonna do the stories you want to do [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5809.86s)]
*  You have to accept that some days the stories are gonna go crazy and some days they're not gonna go crazy [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5813.299999999999s)]
*  And your core fans will really appreciate it, but it's not gonna be this pure numbers game [[01:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5818.98s)]
*  and that's been the the thing that like [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5825.219999999999s)]
*  You know, we've we've we accept because authenticity is like the most important thing to me [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5828.0199999999995s)]
*  But it is one of those things that you gotta go. Okay. Well, okay. This isn't gonna be as big a story [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5833.299999999999s)]
*  We get that how can we be so interesting or so funny? [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5836.74s)]
*  About it that maybe more people will find interest in this thing that we're really interested in [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5840.0199999999995s)]
*  I really think that that is fool's gold right just to go for the viral clip because it's it's like [[01:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5843.7s)]
*  You might get a lot of subscribers or follows or whatever or even just views or likes of that one clip, but they're not real [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5849.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm so glad you keep going. This is great. They're not going to stay like that's why you see people who have a huge number of subscribers [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5855.86s)]
*  On on youtube but very little engagement because their fans are not actually like they just click to watch that one clip [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5861.54s)]
*  But then they're never coming back [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5867.9400000000005s)]
*  Whereas if you just work on doing good programming every day [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5869.46s)]
*  They're real the relationship between you and the people watching is real [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5872.34s)]
*  They they trust you and honor you and vice versa trust you they're here [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5875.14s)]
*  And if you really care about something there are people watching right now that might not care about it at all [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5879.22s)]
*  And the fact that you do they'll give it that little second [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5883.9400000000005s)]
*  They'll give it that minute and they'll be like, okay, maybe I should care about this thing, right? [[01:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5886.42s)]
*  Yeah, I see this I see this all the time it's like um, [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5890.5s)]
*  and this is kind of like where you can see the grift a little bit where [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5893.78s)]
*  There [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5898.34s)]
*  There are people that sometimes are popular because there's great social utility, right? [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5899.38s)]
*  Like there's a version where like this special has social utility and I might get popular with some people because they're called life on netflix [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5903.94s)]
*  Check it out with andrew schultz [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5909.62s)]
*  I wasn't even trying to plug but like maybe they're going through like ivf or fertility issues and they feel like really seen or represented [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5910.58s)]
*  but [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5915.94s)]
*  So maybe for like a moment i'm very important to them [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5916.82s)]
*  But then when that becomes more normalized less stigmatized they realize they don't really agree with me on other issues [[01:38:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5919.299999999999s)]
*  So they're like, okay, I don't need you anymore [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5924.42s)]
*  It's kind of like not to harp on chapiro like kind of what he's gone through [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5926.66s)]
*  It's like he had these great arguments for conservatives at a time where it was like really radioactive to be conservative, right? [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5929.139999999999s)]
*  It's like there are these people that they like needed to defend their positions [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5935.46s)]
*  But you know, they they didn't have these they didn't have like the these like beautiful harvard [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5938.74s)]
*  Like this like no fat at all awesome dart arguments, which he's like really brilliant at making totally and [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5945.16s)]
*  He supplied him and they were like, oh, this is the guy now [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5952.84s)]
*  It's not stigmatized at all to be a conservative the majority of the country is conservative [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5955.24s)]
*  So now they're like, all right. Well, we don't really agree with you on israel palestine [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5959.32s)]
*  So we don't really need you anymore. You don't have social utility. He didn't build that bond with the audience [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5962.679999999999s)]
*  I mean his show is still huge and very very successful. Yeah, i'm not again again [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5967.32s)]
*  I'm saying like, uh, i'm not saying that he's not but clearly there's been some issues over there in terms like a fracturing of the audience [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5971.4s)]
*  Yeah, and the fracture of the audience to me shows that they're not actual fans of him [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5977.72s)]
*  But that there was social utility that he provided [[01:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5982.68s)]
*  And then a quarter of them or 10 20 percent whatever is now going well now i'll no longer need that social utility [[01:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5985.72s)]
*  But it's not just him. I'm saying it could be it can happen to anybody and and [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5991.72s)]
*  What you hope is you have this core which he has his core you have your core [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5996.44s)]
*  I hope I have my core that that will continue to expand when you create authentic shit that matters to you [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=5999.5599999999995s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. Well here's to doing that a lot more of that and if you want to see andrew do that [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=6004.679999999999s)]
*  Seriously, trust me [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-fPIE3uDtQ&t=6010.179999999999s)]
