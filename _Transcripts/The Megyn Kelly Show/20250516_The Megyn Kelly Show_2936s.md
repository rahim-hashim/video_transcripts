# Diddy Trial Deep Dive: "Mob Boss" Background, Issues of Consent, Prosecution and Defense Strategies
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and a special Friday, more casual [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=0.0s)]
*  edition of what's happening in the P Diddy trial. We're actually supposed to be off today, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=5.92s)]
*  but I've been following this case pretty closely and there's been a lot I've wanted to say. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  And we've been trying to sandwich it into other shows. And finally, I just wanted to take a [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  chunk of time to just cover what we've seen this week because there's been a lot of developments [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=21.28s)]
*  and I got a lot of thoughts on this. So coming in sort of on a day off was supposed to be a day [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=26.08s)]
*  off. Thank you to my team for accommodating me on my need to get this off my chest. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=37.2s)]
*  You know the secret to great days, better nights. It all starts by turning your bedroom into a [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=43.599999999999994s)]
*  sanctuary with cozy earth. Their bamboo sheet set is something special. The softest, coolest, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=49.2s)]
*  most luxurious sheets you will ever own, breathable temperature regulating and crafted to help you [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=54.72s)]
*  sleep like it actually matters. Imagine crawling into bed every night and feeling restored, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=59.839999999999996s)]
*  refreshed and ready to take on tomorrow. And don't forget about their bamboo pajamas, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=64.48s)]
*  lightweight yet cozy. They're designed to help you fall asleep faster and stay asleep longer. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=69.6s)]
*  It's the sleepwear upgrade you didn't know you needed, but you definitely deserve. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=74.8s)]
*  Cozy Earth makes it easy. You get a hundred nights risk free. Plus every bedding product [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=79.28s)]

*  heard about Cozy Earth from us at the Megan Kelly show. Sleep better with Cozy Earth. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=103.44s)]
*  I'm horrified by this case. And the more I look at it, the more I think the case is getting stronger [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=109.75999999999999s)]
*  by the day against Diddy for sex trafficking, racketeering and transportation to engage in [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=116.0s)]
*  prostitution. Those are the claims against him. I do not predict he's definitely going to get [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=122.0s)]
*  convicted, but I'm more and more believing it's likely. And that's because watching, for example, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=127.68s)]
*  the cross-examination of the star witness has been, I think, kind of underwhelming. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=135.6s)]
*  I thought that they'd have more and I thought that they'd be a little bit more skilled, [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=142.32s)]
*  but instead they seem to be all over the board. The defense counsel on trying to just score points [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=145.20000000000002s)]
*  with her and they're clearly, I get it, trying to prove that she consented to some of this behavior. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=149.92000000000002s)]
*  Okay. Okay. You need to prove that she consented to all of it. That's the truth. I mean, more [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=155.84s)]
*  accurately stated, the prosecution needs to prove that there were at least some of these sexual [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=165.60000000000002s)]
*  encounters, so-called freak-offs, that were not consensual on her part. And I think they're doing [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=171.44000000000003s)]
*  it. I have to tell you. So let's just take a step back, okay? Because what's interesting about this [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=179.76000000000002s)]
*  case and the reason we're all paying such close attention is because this is one of the most [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=184.4s)]
*  famous men in the world. Sean Combs, Puff Daddy, P. Diddy, whatever, is one of the biggest celebrities [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=187.52s)]
*  in America, in the world. And his star was on the rise. He formed Bad Boy Records. Of course, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=197.52s)]
*  he was very famous for his relationship with J. Lo and being involved in shooting a woman in the [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=203.76s)]
*  face. He allegedly had another person take the fall for him. The woman who got shot in the face [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=209.36s)]
*  says, it was Sean Combs. I saw him and that he paid this other guy to take the fall for him and [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=215.68s)]
*  actually serve time for him. That's not at issue in this case. I'm just saying he's been infamous [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=221.68s)]
*  for a long time. And we've seen him at the award shows, behaving badly and being a bully and just [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=226.88000000000002s)]
*  kind of a douchebag. And we knew that he was a douchebag. I knew he was a douchebag. In my [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=234.24s)]
*  opinion, that's what he was. But it's so far beyond that. This is just so far beyond that. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=239.12s)]
*  This is not the Johnny Depp case, guys. This is not like, oh, you got this controversial guy and [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=246.56s)]
*  this lunatic woman and she's trying to make a buck off of him or she's not taking responsibility [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=252.56s)]
*  for her piece of it. This is not that. It's also not Epstein or R. Kelly, where you're talking [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=258.96s)]
*  about underage girls. The women involved in P. Diddy's Web were of age. They're adults, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=267.03999999999996s)]
*  but that doesn't mean they're incapable of being sex trafficked in the meaning of the law [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=274.64s)]
*  or part of what essentially amounted to a criminal conspiracy of control and [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=280.15999999999997s)]
*  coercion over them. And that's really at heart what the government is alleging against this guy. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=286.47999999999996s)]
*  But P. Diddy's apex of his fame almost was right when he was brought down. I mean, the news reports [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=293.28s)]
*  about him talk about how in 2023, he'd been nominated, I think, for his first solo Grammy, [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=301.91999999999996s)]
*  artist of the year, whatever it was. He was moving up in the awards ceremony world. He was [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=309.52s)]
*  getting more and more recognition. He was releasing an album and he was sort of everywhere [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=314.15999999999997s)]
*  in the media and he knew everyone. Remember that video of him going through the names of the people [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=319.76s)]
*  who came to his parties? It was a who's who of the Oscars and the Grammy Awards. I think I should [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=326.08s)]
*  have said Grammys, not Emmys. That's TV. And he was extremely well connected. Ashton Kutcher [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=335.12s)]
*  at all of his parties and Oprah, of course. He's the one who listed her as coming to his 50th [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=343.52s)]
*  birthday party. Everyone wanted to be near him, his extreme wealth and his infamous party life. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=350.48s)]
*  We had seen these videos of Justin Bieber being handed over to him at age 15. Great job. Great job [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=361.92s)]
*  for his weekend with Diddy Camp. I mean, we don't know, but it certainly looks like Justin [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=370.32s)]
*  Bieber is still suffering the fallout from whatever happened to him as he was coming up [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=376.32000000000005s)]
*  the ranks of the music world. It really doesn't seem worth it. I'd love to hear more from his [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=381.44s)]
*  camp about what's real because it's clear he's suffering. We just don't know from what and what [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=388.0s)]
*  mother out there would give her 15 year old boy over to a grown man who's in the rap industry [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=393.92s)]
*  for a weekend with Diddy Camp without other adult supervision. That's insane. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=400.8s)]
*  Then there was Usher going on with Howard Stern talking about how he was living with Diddy for [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=407.68s)]
*  almost a year and how he would never, never let his young sons at his age then go and do that kind [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=411.84s)]
*  of thing. These are guys who are indebted to Diddy professionally saying, this is Usher at least, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=421.11999999999995s)]
*  saying this is insane. I believe this guy has been abusing people severely for a long, long time. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=427.76s)]
*  I don't think the government's wrong that he behaved like a mob boss, like the rules [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=439.04s)]
*  did not apply to him. Let's face it, they didn't seem to. Where were the repeated [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=445.76s)]
*  police interventions on his behavior? He was too rich, he was too connected, he was too powerful. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=453.2s)]
*  Look how the government opened its case here. By the way, before I get to that, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=460.56s)]
*  so he's reaming back up to the apex of his fame in 2023 and that's when his ex-girlfriend of 11 [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=465.36s)]
*  years, Cassie Ventura, dropped her civil suit against him and it was settled within 24 hours [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=471.76s)]
*  for $20 million. That's really what got people interested. Then more and more started to come [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=478.4s)]
*  forward. Some are just money grabs because they're like, shit, if she can get paid, maybe I can get [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=484.08s)]
*  paid. Some were probably much more serious than that. Some of the more serious ones have [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=487.03999999999996s)]
*  withstood motions to dismiss and are in civil litigation right now. She brings that case and [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=492.32s)]
*  the feds get interested and before we know it, there's a federal raid on his homes and Bob's [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=499.92s)]
*  your uncle. We're in criminal court. Diddy was behaving with impunity for a long, long time. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=504.8s)]
*  And the way the government opened its case kind of proved how he operated. Their first witness [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=516.08s)]
*  was not Cassie or another alleged sex trafficking victim of his or a sex worker. It was an LAPD guy [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=522.32s)]
*  who had been prior to joining the LAPD working security at the Hotel Intercontinental out in LA [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=532.88s)]
*  and was there when that terrible beating we all saw on camera took place. That security guard was [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=539.36s)]
*  the one who got called and who went up to see what the hell was going on. Here's the tape for those of [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=549.12s)]
*  you who have forgotten. He's walking down the hall. Sorry. She's walking down the hall. Stand by. Now [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=554.72s)]
*  he's coming in a towel running, running after her. She's trying to get in the elevator. He grabs [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=564.56s)]
*  her by the head. He whips her down to the floor. He kicks her, kicks her in the head. She's down. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=571.52s)]
*  She stays down. She's testified. He kicks her again. She testified. She stayed down because [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=577.1999999999999s)]
*  she thought it would minimize her injuries and he's literally dragging her down the hallway [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=582.3199999999999s)]
*  and back into the hotel room. There are a number of reasons the prosecution started with that. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=587.68s)]
*  And with this witness who is a third party, not alleged to be a victim of Diddy's, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=592.64s)]
*  not a friend of Diddy's, not a friend of Cassie's, not a sex worker, no one directly involved in this [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=596.88s)]
*  case. This is an LAPD guy who said not only was he there and saw the visible injuries on Cassie, [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=602.0s)]
*  but said that Diddy offered him a bribe. He offered him $100,000 wrapped in a wad. First of all, who [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=608.72s)]
*  the hell is walking around with $100,000 cash on them? Wrapped in a wad and that he declined it [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=616.88s)]
*  and he was smart enough to take out his cell phone and videotape the videotape that was on the [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=623.76s)]
*  security cameras. He was going home for the weekend and he was very wise to do it because [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=628.96s)]
*  he said when he came back on Monday, the hotel tape had disappeared and the testimony was that [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=635.12s)]
*  Diddy did find some security agent willing to delete it. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=642.32s)]
*  Love to hear more about that. But this one, their first witness said, I rejected the bribe [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=646.8s)]
*  and I videotaped what was on that camera. And it was only leaked to CNN recently. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=653.28s)]
*  We hadn't seen that tape. And it tells you so much. There's no doubt he's a physical abuser, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=660.88s)]
*  zero doubt that he is a physical abuser of women. That's not his first rodeo. That guy's been around [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=666.72s)]
*  the block. That's not how you beat a woman when you're just trying it out for the first time. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=673.6s)]
*  Bullshit. There's no question in my mind that this is part of a pattern of abuse that probably went [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=678.8s)]
*  on for years and probably spanned across multiple individuals. And part of the thing we don't know [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=684.72s)]
*  right now is who else is the government calling? They don't have to tell us right now. So we don't [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=691.36s)]
*  know. We know a couple of people. We know Cassie. We know they have another female, Jane Doe, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=695.36s)]
*  who we believe is going to take the stand and say he did this similar behavior to her. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=701.2s)]
*  There's a third witness who absconded. She decided not to testify and she left the jurisdiction, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=705.52s)]
*  according to reports. We don't know exactly who that was or why, but I'm sure that she's terrified. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=712.5600000000001s)]
*  Of course, they're all terrified because what's not going to come into this trial probably [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=718.0s)]
*  are all the other reports around Sean Combs. He denies all of this, just to be clear. He denies [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=723.8399999999999s)]
*  the allegations, the abuse. No, he's admitted that against Cassie in that video because he had to, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=728.88s)]
*  but he denies sex trafficking and he denies racketeering and he denies the prostitution [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=736.0s)]
*  charges and he denies being a serial abuser. But I mean, there are stories again about him [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=740.88s)]
*  firebombing Kid Cudi's car because Kid Cudi was dating Cassie. Who does that? He denies everything. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=747.1999999999999s)]
*  There are lots of other allegations about Biggie Smalls and what if anything Sean Combs did to [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=758.4799999999999s)]
*  him. He was part of his record label. He was part of Sean Combs' Bad Boys record label. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=765.3599999999999s)]
*  What's he going to say? He's no fan of Diddy. That seems clear. What happened with him? What [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=771.76s)]
*  happened in the past with some of these big rapper battles like Tupac Shakur? There are all sorts of [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=778.8000000000001s)]
*  questions about what Diddy has done, to whom, when, how extensively involved, none of which [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=786.72s)]
*  this trial is going to get into. It's too big. They've decided sort of Al Capone-like [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=793.2s)]
*  to focus on the few charges they think they can prove beyond a reasonable doubt. And the rest is [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=799.28s)]
*  just sort of noise. But it shouldn't be for the press, the public. We should know before. Why [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=803.6s)]
*  don't we choose more carefully who we're going to lionize? Not just us, but like the Harvard's and [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=812.5600000000001s)]
*  the MIT's of the world. Look how they lionized Epstein, not to mention the Bill Clintons. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=819.28s)]
*  Why don't we choose more carefully who we're going to put up on these pedestals? Jeffrey [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=824.08s)]
*  Epstein was lionized even after he had pleaded guilty to this act of prostitution with a 14-year- [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=829.5200000000001s)]
*  old. Still, Katie Couric's going to his house for dinner. Why? Not to mention Prince Andrew. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=835.84s)]
*  We were so obsessed with people who attain great wealth and have the trappings of it all around [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=843.76s)]
*  them. It's like some sort of magic elixir to other people, even if they're wealthy, too. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=851.12s)]
*  You must know something. You must be someone. Instead of having a healthy disdain for that and [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=856.08s)]
*  questioning, how'd you get it? I'd like to know more. If I sit next to Tom Brady at a dinner, [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=863.28s)]
*  I'm going to know exactly how he got his money, and I'm fine with that. But like an Epstein [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=871.12s)]
*  and a P. Diddy or a Weinstein about whom there's always been a rumor mill of bad behavior, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=876.1600000000001s)]
*  I mean, it just makes you wonder. Like before you actually get in business with this person or in [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=882.0s)]
*  bed with this person, how much more would you need to know? How much due diligence should you be [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=887.2s)]
*  doing? And lionizing them, yeah, same rule. So Diddy, after the Cassie lawsuit gets hit with a [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=892.48s)]
*  bunch of lawsuits and then ultimately the raids and then this criminal case and the feds Al Capone [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=900.32s)]
*  style have not charged everything under the sun. They've charged three main charges, racketeering, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=907.12s)]
*  sex trafficking, and the transport of a prostitute. And I'll tell you, I don't know about the [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=914.48s)]
*  racketeering charge. It's pretty sweeping. And I'll tell you what the general elements are. [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=922.5600000000001s)]
*  So you can understand it's a lot. And you can ask yourself whether you think they've proved their [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=930.32s)]
*  case. It's going to be probably an uphill battle on the racketeering. That's the toughest one. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=939.2s)]
*  But the other two are looking good. Racketeering, okay, that he has [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=945.36s)]
*  with others and just because no one else has been charged, which normally in a RICO case, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=954.24s)]
*  you would have others charged. It was a statute designed to get mob bosses trying to get at [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=958.0s)]
*  criminal behavior. That's like a web of criminal behavior that you can't necessarily prove like [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=963.6s)]
*  the one thing or the statute of limitations expired on the other thing. But you're just [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=968.8s)]
*  showing this bad guy who's operating what's clearly an enterprise that over and over engages [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=971.6s)]
*  in criminal problems or criminal acts. So they've used it against many non mob bosses since it was [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=975.68s)]
*  created and they've used it against people like Epstein. They were going to [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=981.68s)]
*  for this kind of behavior. So what they're saying is that the defendant and others known and unknown [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=989.28s)]
*  being persons employed by and associated with his enterprise engaged in, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=994.0s)]
*  and in a way that affects interstate commerce, they conspired together and they engaged in an effort [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1000.2399999999999s)]
*  to violate the racketeering laws of the United States. And what they say is we mean that [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1006.0s)]
*  they committed multiple acts involving, by the way, under the law, I think you just need to [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1011.76s)]
*  multiple acts involving kidnapping, arson, bribery, and more. The general list at the [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1016.64s)]
*  front of the complaint says arson, bribery and obstruction of justice too. So among others. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1028.0s)]
*  Now the kidnapping and standby, I'm just looking at my list here, kidnapping arson, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1034.5600000000002s)]
*  that's probably going to be the kid, cutty stuff. We'll see. That's, she testified to this, [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1045.68s)]
*  like they got this from Cassie when she took the stand, that videotape she testified was her [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1052.3200000000002s)]
*  running out of a freak off. She'd had enough. She was escaping and that he ran after her, [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1061.1200000000001s)]
*  dragged her back and forced her to continue. Now that's kidnapping right there and it's assault. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1066.56s)]
*  And just because the state prosecutor in California did not bring charges against Diddy, [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1073.52s)]
*  which he should have. But again, that tape was kept secret for some 10 years. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1080.4s)]
*  So the statute of limitations may have expired. So it's not being charged as an individual act, [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1085.76s)]
*  but that her showing us that and saying, I was escaping a freak off and dragged back in there [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1090.24s)]
*  to continue is kidnapping. And on top of it, it meets the other, it meets the other elements as [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1097.1200000000001s)]
*  well. It's a person in a room with a sex prostitute, which she testified to someone being paid to be [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1104.0s)]
*  there to engage in sex acts. And she's testifying. She was there under coercion. That's sex [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1111.9199999999998s)]
*  trafficking. And there was testimony that he did this with her across state lines and outside of [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1119.76s)]
*  the country too, like down in Turks and Caicos or some, one of those tropical islands not owned by [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1124.9599999999998s)]
*  the United States. So that is the second count sex trafficking by force fraud or coercion, saying that [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1129.9199999999998s)]
*  from at least 2009 up until 2018, he in and affecting interstate and foreign commerce, [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1137.44s)]
*  knowingly recruited enticed, harbored, transported, provided, obtained, advertised, maintained, [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1144.48s)]
*  patronized and solicited by any means a person knowing and in reckless disregard of the fact [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1149.68s)]
*  that means of force, threats of force, fraud and coercion would be used. What they're trying to say [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1155.44s)]
*  to force that person to engage in a commercial sex act. What they're saying is in interstate commerce, [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1160.48s)]
*  he transported would be enough a person through means of force, fraud or coercion into a commercial [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1166.88s)]
*  sex act. Okay. Well, where was the Ford, the force, fraud or coercion? The prostitutes are [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1177.52s)]
*  going to testify that they did it willingly. Now, the first guy said I was there willingly. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1182.48s)]
*  They're paying me, but he also took a picture of my license and seemed to be threatening me [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1186.24s)]
*  that if I spoke or didn't behave as he wanted me to, he was going to, you can hurt me. There [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1190.5600000000002s)]
*  would be retribution. So that's evidence of some force or coercion, but it's really coming down [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1195.9199999999998s)]
*  right now to Cassie who is showing us the tape. I tried to escape. He grabbed me by the hair and [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1200.6399999999999s)]
*  dragged me down the hallway back into one of the freak offs. That would be coercion to go back into [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1207.1999999999998s)]
*  this room and engage in a commercial sex act. She's not the one getting paid. The lover is, [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1213.28s)]
*  and she testified to that. So you don't, and then you also have to prove that he knew, Sean knew [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1219.92s)]
*  that the victim was engaging in this act as a result of force, fraud or coercion. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1227.36s)]
*  Well, the defense is offering emails of her saying, I want to do the freak offs. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1232.1599999999999s)]
*  I'm into it. Can't wait to freak off. It's all from 2009 so far, 2010. There was some testimony, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1236.8s)]
*  some email correspondence. They're not sharing all the email language with us. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1243.6s)]
*  Before that 2016 one that resulted in the beating that we saw in the hallway. But even if they have [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1247.92s)]
*  an email suggesting she wanted to do that one and she's disputing that, [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1253.76s)]
*  seems pretty clear on the tape. She was done with the freak off. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1260.24s)]
*  Seems pretty clear. The consent had been withdrawn. And by the way, as a legal matter, [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1263.44s)]
*  a woman can withdraw her consent to a sex act literally in the middle of sex. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1268.88s)]
*  The first two minutes can be consensual. And if she says, I'm done, get off of me, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1274.08s)]
*  the next minute would be rape. If he doesn't listen, that's the law. So you can certainly [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1278.0s)]
*  participate voluntarily in one of these freak offs, which she said, some of them last four days. [[00:21:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1283.84s)]
*  And maybe on day one you're good, but by the time you're on day four, you're saying, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1288.96s)]
*  I want to get out of here. Let me go. And if he chases you down the hallway and grabs you and pulls [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1293.04s)]
*  you back into the room where the commercial sex worker is there on the clock for money, [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1300.96s)]
*  you're F'd. You're F'd. You are going to be charged likely with sex trafficking by force, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1306.1599999999999s)]
*  fraud or coercion. That's count two of this indictment. Now, maybe the jury will be persuaded. [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1312.0s)]
*  Maybe the defense has one of these emails or texts for every single freak off. She said there were [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1318.72s)]
*  hundreds, so I doubt it. She's doing more of a narrative explanation of what happens. She's [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1323.52s)]
*  saying in the beginning of our relationship, by the way, there was a 17 year age difference. She [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1329.76s)]
*  was 19 when it started. He threw a 21st birthday party and invited Paris Hilton and Britney Spears. [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1335.28s)]
*  She was an ingenue. She was as green and doe-eyed as they came. And this older, much more successful, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1343.04s)]
*  more sophisticated, bully, criminal thug took advantage of this young girl, so beautiful, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1351.36s)]
*  everything in front of her and lured her into his world through promises of making her in the music [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1360.08s)]
*  industry, remaking her, making her over, teaching her how to dress and how to be in a way that would [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1367.36s)]
*  be enticing for others. Of course, that would be extremely alluring for any young woman, [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1376.8s)]
*  but there was a price to be paid. And in the beginning, he wooed her. My God, this is a [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1382.72s)]
*  pattern. I mean, you guys have seen it. You've heard it just on this case, this show enough to [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1387.04s)]
*  know it is a pattern of abusers to love bomb the women at the beginning. If those are the roles, [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1390.48s)]
*  the gender roles, men versus women, it can happen the other way, but it's this kind of abuse, [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1398.24s)]
*  domestic abuse with a love bombing is generally men on women. And then once he obtains control over [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1404.1599999999999s)]
*  her, comes the abuse. It can be verbal, it can be financial, and it can be physical. And she testified [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1409.52s)]
*  that he beat her many times. And the second witness of the case was a sex worker, not the one who was [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1417.4399999999998s)]
*  in that room for the 2016 Intercontinental Hotel incident, freak off slash beating, but a different [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1423.76s)]
*  one, a different sex worker, the one who said I had to show my license. And he said he heard [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1430.96s)]
*  Diddy slapping her behind closed doors, that they had an argument. I think that he threw a bottle at [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1437.76s)]
*  her and then they went behind closed doors and he heard him slapping her and he heard her saying, [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1443.76s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm sorry. And then he expressed his concern directly to her. He sounds like this guy [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1449.04s)]
*  was kind of falling in love with Cassie and he worried about her. This is the hired sex worker. [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1454.08s)]
*  But he was hired so often, he felt like he was getting to know them and she and he would kind [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1461.1200000000001s)]
*  of side text from time to time. And he felt that she was in danger in Diddy's world. This is [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1465.92s)]
*  the third party. Again, yes, he was involved, not like the security guard. He was involved in their [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1473.1200000000001s)]
*  relationship and their freak off, but he's setting the stage and the prosecution with those first two [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1477.52s)]
*  witnesses is setting the stage that this was not a purely voluntary thing, that Cassie did feel [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1481.44s)]
*  coerced and feel like she had no other choice and understood very well that there would be a [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1489.12s)]
*  high price to pay if she did not do what he wanted. And it really doesn't matter. Again, if that [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1494.56s)]
*  coercion began mid freak off, pre freak off, or if in the beginning of their relationship, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1501.36s)]
*  when she was very young, 2008, seven, nine, when they're showing her her loving texts toward Diddy [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1507.76s)]
*  that she was genuinely in love with him and possibly wanted to do these things. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1515.2s)]
*  She was explaining that she did love him, that she felt there was actual tender love between the two [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1521.12s)]
*  of them. And she felt he loved her too, though he was dating other women. He was hiding her. He [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1525.52s)]
*  wouldn't bring her out in public. She didn't like that. He was spending all the holidays with Kim [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1531.9199999999998s)]
*  Porter, the mother of some of his other children. There are many, many baby mamas in his world. And [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1536.3999999999999s)]
*  he wasn't treating her in any way like an equal or a partner, but this poor [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1544.56s)]
*  lost girl who now had been hooked by this guy had been repeatedly, I mean, it's a form of sexual [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1548.8799999999999s)]
*  abuse, what he was doing to her, whether she knew it or not. It is not love to take a 17 years, [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1556.48s)]
*  younger, 19, 20, 21 year old girl and have some sex worker come into your private home or hotel [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1564.48s)]
*  room and urinate down her mouth to the point she's gagging. You fucking cretin Sean Combs. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1575.44s)]
*  That's what the evidence was. That's one of the many reasons I think he's a disgusting, [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1583.52s)]
*  perverted criminal. It's my opinion. And she was fooled into believing it was because she was young. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1587.92s)]
*  I don't know what her background was, but I guarantee you it wasn't great. And she's, [[00:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1595.1200000000001s)]
*  she testified that even now, even up until the recent, you know, past couple of years, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1599.6000000000001s)]
*  she's had suicidal ideations. She's married now to what appears to be a nice man by all accounts. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1605.76s)]
*  They've got a child and she's, I think they've got two children and she's about to give birth [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1611.3600000000001s)]
*  to number three. That's why they had to rush her onto the stand because the prosecution [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1614.88s)]
*  understands she is the star witness and you know, she's got two weeks to go. This baby could come [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1618.4s)]
*  at any time. And everybody understood once the baby's here, all bets are off. She might not testify. [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1623.1200000000001s)]
*  So they were right to put her on the stand, but even now with her life ironed out and a good man [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  by all accounts in her life, she's still having suicidal ideations or at least was up until recently. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1634.16s)]
*  She was very tearful on the stand. She's very soft spoken. This is not some strong, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1641.1200000000001s)]
*  fierce, bad-ass woman. Even in the text messages, you can tell she's very sweet. [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1645.8400000000001s)]
*  Even the defense counsel seemed to be conceding that in the cross-examination of her. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1651.76s)]
*  And their answer to it is have Diddy sitting there in a sweater. For our listening audience, [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1657.6000000000001s)]
*  I have a great sweatshirt on today, but like, you know, you know, it's sort of a wool sweater like [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1662.0s)]
*  this with this little polo collar and a Bible. His hair is gray now and he's wearing reading [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1665.28s)]
*  glasses. Oh, he's basically grandpa. No, actually he's not grandpa. He only called himself pop-up [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1672.56s)]
*  in his texts with her because he found out that was her endearing term for her grandpa. [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1679.28s)]
*  Like it was for me and mine. What a sick effort. He found out she called her grandfather pop-up [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1684.72s)]
*  and then he insisted she call him that the guy who was forcing her to do it with unknown sex workers, [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1692.16s)]
*  et cetera. So he called her BG baby girl and she called him pop-up per his request. I'm just so, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1700.5600000000002s)]
*  it's so foul. So the defense yesterday got their hands on her Thursday for the first time and [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1710.4s)]
*  they were all over the map. They were making some, they were scoring some points in terms of [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1726.3200000000002s)]
*  she loved him. She was definitely requesting at least a couple of these freak offs and it's in [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1730.88s)]
*  writing. Now she was saying, those are just words by that point. She was denying that she actually [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1735.76s)]
*  wanted them and it's hard because if you look at the overall narrative of her first two days on the [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1742.32s)]
*  stand, she was talking about the coercion and the control he had over her and how she didn't want to [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1748.4s)]
*  be doing it. And she knew she'd pay a price if she didn't. And she was afraid of him and he would [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1752.8s)]
*  physically threaten her. So it's okay. You can pull out like in the course of hundreds of these [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1757.28s)]
*  things, one or two, or she's trying to please him. And she also testified that some of the time she [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1762.24s)]
*  knew she had to. And so she'd volunteer to do it like three days in advance. That's the 2016 one, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1767.6s)]
*  she said of an award ceremony she was supposed to appear at because she knew she'd have to take [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1774.32s)]
*  drugs to get through it. And that sometimes she would be physically hurt. And she wanted to look [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1780.0s)]
*  nice at her movie premiere or at the premiere of an album, an award show. So she would try to convince [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1785.6s)]
*  him to get it done like three days before so she could recover from these things. I mean, this is [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1793.12s)]
*  sick. This is a depraved individual. And just keep in mind, she's not the only one that we're going [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1799.84s)]
*  to have more women come forward, we believe, and take the stand and say he did this with them too. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1806.0s)]
*  And as far as the racketeering goes, there's been testimony that his staff was facilitating it. They [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1810.4s)]
*  would set up the rooms, they would deconstruct the rooms, they would clean the rooms, they would [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1818.8000000000002s)]
*  bring in fresh linens from all the blood and human fluids and baby oil that were all over the beds [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1822.0800000000002s)]
*  of these hotels. It's absolutely disgusting. Yes, he was obsessed with baby oil. I know we're all [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1831.6000000000001s)]
*  kind of joking about baby oil now. It's just sick. Like he wanted to heat it up. He wanted her putting [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1837.12s)]
*  it on sex workers, sex workers putting it on her. He wanted her to watch him with female sex workers [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1841.6s)]
*  too. Made her do that. And the defense is trying to say it's all consensual. We've got these emails [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1847.9199999999998s)]
*  showing some of them were at her request or she was at least open minded or seemed to [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1855.52s)]
*  be anticipating it with favor. And therefore this wasn't coercive. As for the beat down we've seen [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1861.84s)]
*  on tape, they seem to want to suggest he was angry about his phone, something that happened to his [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1867.4399999999998s)]
*  phone and not that she left the freak off. Now they're not going to get that in evidence in any [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1875.52s)]
*  meaningful way unless he testifies. And if he testifies, all bets are off. It would be a disaster. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1880.24s)]
*  I think it will seal his fate beyond doubt. And he's just arrogant enough to think he might be [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1885.28s)]
*  able to get away with it. But unless they can convince the jury through some other means that [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1893.92s)]
*  that's what he was angry about when he beat her, I think they're going to accept Cassie's testimony [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1898.6399999999999s)]
*  because she was quick to own it when she didn't know something. She wasn't an argumentative [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1902.96s)]
*  witness. Even the judge at one point said to the defense, look, you've got a very cooperative [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1909.12s)]
*  witness. Like, come on. Because they were saying, oh, we might need to hold her over to Monday. We [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1912.88s)]
*  don't know when we're going to be done with her. And he was like, you're going to finish up with [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1917.8400000000001s)]
*  her on Friday. That's it. This was the schedule. You knew this was the schedule. Get it over with. [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1920.5600000000002s)]
*  And the baby's about to pop for God's sake. And by the way, think of the poor stress that this woman's [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1925.68s)]
*  under. For all my female listeners who've had kids, remember yourself in the last two weeks of [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1930.96s)]
*  your pregnancy. Remember what an enormous whale you were and how even emotionally vulnerable you [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1935.68s)]
*  become. It's like somebody could stick a pin in you and you feel like you'd pop. You'd be like a [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1940.64s)]
*  verruca salt. No, violet Beauregard type. Juicy everywhere, rolling around on the wonka floor like [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1944.24s)]
*  a blueberry. You're totally not yourself. You're spicy and you're maybe kind of emotional and [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1951.44s)]
*  you just, you don't feel like yourself. You're excited. You're nervous. Even if it's your third [[00:32:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1960.8000000000002s)]
*  kid. I've had three kids. It's a big, very big deal to squeeze another human being out of your body. [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1965.76s)]
*  And I mean, it's quite a testament to this woman's strength on some level to be doing this at all. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1970.56s)]
*  The other woman's going under Jane Doe. Like this woman is like there with her real name [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1977.84s)]
*  and you know, the stress hormones that are running through her body. I'm sure this was [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1984.56s)]
*  calculated by her on whether she wants to do this. You know, am I going to hurt my baby? Am I going [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1988.4s)]
*  to endanger my pregnancy? But things don't get any more emotionally relaxed in the first four weeks [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=1994.16s)]
*  of motherhood after you have your baby either. So clear is very important to her to take the stand [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2002.24s)]
*  and do this. And there's no picture whatsoever being painted of her as a villain. That's why I [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2007.8400000000001s)]
*  say it's not like Amber Heard. Even the defense seems to be conceiving. This is a sweet lady. [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2013.76s)]
*  Their best defense is she was into it. And I'm sorry, but that that hotel videotape is just [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2018.8s)]
*  absolutely freaking devastating to their case. Because what we know more than anything is [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2027.2s)]
*  she was not into it that day. All she wanted was to get away from him. And he came out there [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2035.28s)]
*  like a criminal thug, beat the shit out of her and dragged her back to his room in which she was [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2043.44s)]
*  sitting naked prior to putting on that towel. I just think that's going to be enough for most of [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2049.76s)]
*  these jurors. Look at her getting out of there. For the listening audience, we're showing the tape [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2056.16s)]
*  again. He's running, running. He's just holding the towel together. He didn't even have the time [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2060.56s)]
*  to fold it on properly. Grabbed her like a rag doll. Kicked her in the head grabbing her stuff. [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2066.72s)]
*  This is in public. Basically, it's a public hotel. Kicked her again. The anger. So these kicks, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2074.0s)]
*  he's incredibly angry. Oh, and by the way, they tried to establish through Cassie when she was [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2080.72s)]
*  on the stand that he was upset because they took bad drugs the night before. He was on a bad drug [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2086.3199999999997s)]
*  trip. I don't give a shit and neither will the jury. She testified that he was violent with her [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2091.6s)]
*  many times. As I said, she's already gotten sex worker testimony that he heard him abuse. How many [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2097.6s)]
*  bad drug trips did he have? And is that really a defense to coercion? I don't think so. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2101.6s)]
*  I guess that's it. That's where we are right now. This thing's supposed to go eight weeks. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2110.72s)]
*  We're in week one. Week one. I'm looking at the sex trafficking count. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2116.08s)]
*  All right. Interstate and foreign commerce, there was testimony that they crossed eight lines [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2124.0s)]
*  and even country lines that he transported or provided or obtained or patronized or solicited [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2128.24s)]
*  any person to engage in a commercial sex act, again, by use of force, threats of force, [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2135.36s)]
*  fraud and coercion. So she's the one being forced. The sex worker is the one who makes it commercial. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2144.96s)]
*  He definitely transported and provided and so on prostitutes into these rooms. I think the jury's [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2153.92s)]
*  going to accept that. And then the last piece of that second count is that he did it knowingly and [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2160.56s)]
*  in reckless disregard of the fact that it was by force, fraud and coercion. And that's one of the [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2165.36s)]
*  things they're going to argue. He didn't know. If she didn't want to be there, he didn't know [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2171.36s)]
*  because she was sending him emails saying, I want to do it. Well, he knew at the intercontinental [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2174.56s)]
*  because she had her clothes on and she was running and he beat the shit out of her and dragged her [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2179.68s)]
*  back there. He knew that's just how are they going to get around that? There's a reason the prosecution [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2183.52s)]
*  opened its case with that videotape. And I don't know what else we're going to see on these [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2187.92s)]
*  videotapes or what else the jury is going to see. The prosecution has held its cards close to the [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2192.56s)]
*  vest. The one unknown dynamic here is not totally wowed by the strength of the lawyering on either [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2198.88s)]
*  side. Believe it or not, you have James Comey's daughter as the lead prosecutor and you have [[00:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2208.7200000000003s)]
*  Mark Garagos' daughter as one of the lead defense attorneys. Isn't that crazy? [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2215.92s)]
*  And the other defense attorneys, it's actually very interesting. It's Mark Agnifilo. And Mark [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2220.4s)]
*  Agnifilo is the guy who defended Keith Ranieri in that NXIVM sex cult case from Albany, New York, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2225.6800000000003s)]
*  my hometown. And I think if you remember, I've shown you my interview of him when I was in NBC [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2233.52s)]
*  on the NXIVM case and how he was going to defend these claims by these women who got branded as [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2240.0s)]
*  part of a Keith Ranieri sex cult with his initials. And Agnifilo said to me, oh, same defense he's [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2246.4s)]
*  bringing here. Look, this is a New York jury, he said. We don't do disempowered women. There's no [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2254.8s)]
*  cult. You're not forced to do anything. These women got the brand because they wanted it. [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2262.8s)]
*  They had sex with Keith Ranieri because they wanted to. No one made them do anything. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2267.44s)]
*  And that is literally what they said is going to be the defense here. These women were there [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2271.68s)]
*  of their own volition. Nobody forced them. Sean Combs didn't force them. I've got emails. I got [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2277.28s)]
*  texts showing. I can't wait for the freak off. Let's do it this Friday. There's no force. [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2282.56s)]
*  It's like he tries to spin like a girl power moment out of all of this. Like, no, it's impossible for [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2291.6s)]
*  a strong woman to be abused or something. And that's the other defense, of course, [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2299.52s)]
*  that this is all just a weird sex life. But I do think we have to bear in mind [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2303.68s)]
*  there's something dangerous about not understanding that domestic violence can absolutely be a part [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2308.96s)]
*  of sex trafficking and a racketeering case like this, where you're saying it's a criminal enterprise [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2318.7999999999997s)]
*  in which you force multiple women into your weird sex web that involves other criminal acts, [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2325.68s)]
*  potentially like kidnapping, like assault, like drugs. And there's been some testimony to that [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2331.6s)]
*  effect as well. Just because domestic violence is a thing that happens outside of the sex [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2337.12s)]
*  trafficking arena, it happens in people's private homes every day in this country, [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2346.64s)]
*  far too many times. So just because it isn't a thing, it is a thing that's independent of [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2352.16s)]
*  potential criminal charges involving racketeering or sex trafficking, doesn't mean that racketeering [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2357.2s)]
*  and sex trafficking will never involve domestic violence. Or just because a freaky sex life [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2362.3199999999997s)]
*  can happen and does happen every day in this country in non-criminal settings, doesn't mean [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2371.04s)]
*  that it can't cross over to being a part of a criminal enterprise like racketeering or something [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2376.64s)]
*  you would see on camera or hear testimony about in a sex trafficking case. So we have to be aware [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2384.08s)]
*  that this is the only defense that's available to Sean Combs. She wanted it is really what he's [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2392.0s)]
*  saying. We're both freaks in the bedroom. Everyone was there of their own volition. [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2397.8399999999997s)]
*  There was no coercion of anyone in these rooms. Frankly, I don't know how he's going to get [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2403.2s)]
*  past the prostitution counts. That's going to be transportation to engage in prostitution, [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2410.7999999999997s)]
*  which doesn't really require too much. He knowingly transported individuals in [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2418.0s)]
*  interstate or foreign commerce with the intent that they engage in prostitution. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2421.6s)]
*  It doesn't require fraud, coercion, or force. He knowingly transported individuals in interstate [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2425.3599999999997s)]
*  and foreign commerce with the intent that they engage in prostitution. Well, we've already had [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2431.76s)]
*  testimony to that effect and there's going to be more, my understanding is. And Cassie, [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2435.44s)]
*  two witnesses have already testified to that. Now that's got a lower penalty, [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2439.28s)]
*  but the sex trafficking, the one that I read to you before, sex trafficking by force, fraud, [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2443.5200000000004s)]
*  or coercion, that alone could be 15 years. And you add the Rico in there and now we're talking [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2448.1600000000003s)]
*  potential life in prison on all these counts. But I'm just saying he's looking at some very [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2452.6400000000003s)]
*  serious prison time on all of these. And it's no defense. Like she wanted it to the transportation [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2456.24s)]
*  to engage in prostitution count. Now you just have to keep in mind, she wanted it has to apply [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2462.4799999999996s)]
*  across the board. And I just don't know how they're going to get there. There's just too many of them [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2470.0s)]
*  and the tape is too brutal and the testimony of the sex worker about the fight and him slapping [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2477.12s)]
*  her behind closed doors. And even one of her text messages says, when we both want the freak offs, [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2481.6s)]
*  I love them. Well, what does that mean? So what I see is two okay lawyers on the prosecution and the [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2487.36s)]
*  defense side squaring off against one another and each building the planting the seeds for their [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2497.36s)]
*  garden in closing argument. And you're going to have the prosecution get up there and they are [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2504.64s)]
*  just going to go element by element on each of these charges. That's what they're doing. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2509.44s)]
*  They're eliciting testimony to prove each of the elements they need to prove and they will go [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2513.04s)]
*  through them piecemeal on kidnapping. What was it bribery? That's another one of the predicate acts [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2517.52s)]
*  for the Rico count. We've already had the testimony on that. The security guard was offered [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2523.68s)]
*  a hundred thousand dollars to get rid of the tape. She said that under oath. They really didn't dent [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2529.12s)]
*  that guy up at all. He added more on the stand about he and combs scuffling over, I think his [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2533.84s)]
*  phone, maybe combs had seen him videotape the videotape and they got in his grill about why he [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2539.28s)]
*  didn't put that in his report. And the guy's like, look, I didn't put every detail in the report, [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2544.88s)]
*  but you know, obviously the beating happened. The security guard we know is telling the truth on [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2547.6800000000003s)]
*  that. We've all seen it. So that's, that guy's talking about bribery. You got bribery there. [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2554.1600000000003s)]
*  Looks like you got kidnapping right there on camera. That's two. All you need is two predicate [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2559.04s)]
*  acts for conspiracy under Rico. And you generally have other defendants. Again, it appears some have [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2564.56s)]
*  cut deals. That's my belief. I believe there are probably unindicted co-conspirators who are [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2569.92s)]
*  probably going to take the stand against Diddy and say, I arranged the room. I provided the baby oil. [[00:42:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2575.12s)]
*  I paid the prostitutes. I supplied the drugs. I mean, why are we going eight weeks? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2579.28s)]
*  If we're not going to hear that. So all of that is coming our way. And I would say now when we are [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2584.08s)]
*  at week one, and I should offer the caveat that we're doing this Friday morning around 11 [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2590.72s)]
*  and she's back on the witness stand getting crossed again right now that the defense is still [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2595.2s)]
*  crossing. And then the prosecution will do a redirect and then a recross, et cetera. So that, [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2599.9199999999996s)]
*  so maybe something dramatic will happen today before we go to, you know, air with this. But [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2604.48s)]
*  right now I think the prosecution is getting it done. They're not, they're not wowing me. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2609.92s)]
*  And the defense is not wowing me either. They don't have, you know, what was her name? Vasquez, [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2614.4s)]
*  the lawyer who cross-examined Amber Heard. Yeah. Camille Vasquez. She was a star. They don't have [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2621.84s)]
*  that on team defense. Not so far. And they don't have a witness who can be made into a villain [[00:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2628.8s)]
*  like Amber Heard pretty easily was, you know, when she did fine on her cross. You remember [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2636.24s)]
*  I actually found her on her direct. I found her direct kind of compelling and then she got [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2641.3599999999997s)]
*  across and it was just so clear. Her whole story fell apart. That's not happening to Cassie Ventura. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2644.8799999999997s)]
*  It's not happening. So that's where we are after one week of the ditty trial. I really think [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2651.04s)]
*  we need this. We need this full airing of this man's behavior. It was past time and it shouldn't [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2656.16s)]
*  stop at this criminal trial. Like this isn't my world. I cover politics, you know, for the most [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2668.08s)]
*  part and, you know, massive cultural stories too. But the people who cover the entertainment [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2673.6s)]
*  industry, the people who covered the music industry, where the hell were you losers? [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c7i2eB9NUW8&t=2678.0s)]
