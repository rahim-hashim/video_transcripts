# Shocking NSA Chat Logs, Bezos Brings New WashPost Revolt, and White House vs. Press, w/ Buck Sexton
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 27, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. The corporate media [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=0.0s)]
*  is having a bigger meltdown this week than any other of the Trump presidency so far. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3.84s)]
*  There's Joy Reid's firing on MSNBC. Take care, sweetheart. We'll miss you in our own special way. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=8.08s)]
*  There's the revolt over Washington Post owner Jeff Bezos putting his stamp on the outlet's opinion [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  page. And there is the ongoing Doge Saga as Elon Musk starred in President Trump's first cabinet [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=21.76s)]
*  meeting yesterday. They are horrified that someone who's not in the cabinet would show up at the [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=28.32s)]
*  cabinet meeting and actually try to run herd on this thing. Like this person thinks that they're [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=34.24s)]
*  in the cabinet and they're not actually in the cabinet and how dare they do that. It's very [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=39.68s)]
*  upsetting and it's totally inappropriate unless your name is Jill Biden. In which case it's very [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=44.08s)]
*  laudable and good for her or we didn't even notice it. Joining me now to discuss it all is Buck [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=49.2s)]
*  Sexton. He's co-host of the Clay, Travis and Buck Sexton show. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=55.04s)]
*  show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. Here's one way to clean up your medicine [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=62.24s)]
*  cabinet this season and replace toxin-filled conventional products with more natural options. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=67.68s)]
*  Propolis Immune Support Throat Spray and Propolis Plus Vitamin C Liposamol can be must-haves in the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=73.44s)]
*  medicine cabinet as seasonal germs start to hit. Did you know germs can enter through your nasal [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=80.56s)]
*  passages just as easily as through your mouth? Propolis Nasal Spray is a great non-toxic swap [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=86.0s)]
*  for other over-the-counter drug-filled medications. This one's non-habit forming, it's natural and it [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=92.4s)]
*  has anti-microbial benefits. Beekeepers Naturals makes clean non-toxic products that actually work. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=97.68s)]
*  They never use harmful ingredients like Red Dye Number 3 or other synthetic dyes or artificial [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  flavors. Their products are third-party tested for all pesticides and they're dedicated to [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=110.16s)]
*  sustainable beekeeping and helping to save the bees. Beekeepers Naturals is offering you an exclusive [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=116.08s)]
*  offer. Go to beekeepersnaturals.com.au or enter the code MEGAN to get 20% off your order. That's [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=122.16s)]

*  are also available at Target, Whole Foods, Walmart, CVS and Walgreens. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=138.72s)]
*  Buck, welcome back. Hey Megan, thanks for having me. So it's one thing, it's one thing [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=143.52s)]
*  to have Jill Biden show up but it's totally different to have Elon Musk show up and try to [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=150.56s)]
*  be accountable to the press and the cabinet. That is a bridge too far. They are out of line [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=157.68s)]
*  in having Elon there and you need look no further than today's headlines to figure that out. CNN, [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=164.0s)]
*  Trump's cabinet meeting serves as a backdrop to Musk's power. It's just a backdrop. Trump was like [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=170.24s)]
*  a supporting cast member. New York Times, Musk's cabinet cameo, the elephant in the room wore black. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=176.48s)]
*  The Guardian, Trump cabinet flunkies, Hale wannabe Caesar and Elon his oligarch pal. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=184.24s)]
*  And let's just give you a little contrast. When Jill Biden attended a cabinet meeting in September, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=192.4s)]
*  this just passed September 2024, it was Biden's first in 11 months. Look at her sitting at the [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=197.84s)]
*  head of the table. The CNN headline was not a cabinet meeting serves as backdrop to Jill Biden's [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=203.12s)]
*  power. It was Joe Biden directs cabinet to run through the tape in legacy burnishing meeting [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=211.36s)]
*  and then 21 paragraphs in, they mentioned first lady Jill Biden shared an update on a women's [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=220.32s)]
*  health research initiative. New York Times, did they mention Jill? No, not a word. The Guardian, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=226.96s)]
*  who's so upset now about how the flunkies hailed the wannabe Caesar and Elon, his oligarch, [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=232.96s)]
*  nothing, didn't say one word. But Elon, bridge too far. Well, to be fair, I think that the [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=237.44s)]
*  the president, the former president's wife was about as much the president as he was. I mean, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=246.48000000000002s)]
*  Jill Biden was probably making more decisions behind the scenes of any consequence than Joe [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=251.28s)]
*  Biden was, which now even the Democrats and the Democrat aligned media more or less admit, [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=256.48s)]
*  at least they do for the last year of his term. But yes, obviously, Megan, the criticism is [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=262.24s)]
*  increasingly desperate and pathetic, I think, from the media specifically about Elon. I mean, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  here you have the richest man in the world, self-made richest man in the world, and every [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=274.64s)]
*  CEO that I've talked to, and I know you've talked to, you know, the titans of industry, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=281.12s)]
*  everyone respects this guy, and then some and a lot of people will just say he's a genius, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=285.91999999999996s)]
*  specifically at what he's trying to help our government do, which is address inefficiencies, [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=290.96s)]
*  bureaucracy, bloat, waste, break through the really hard problems. Why is Elon the richest man in the [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=296.4s)]
*  world? Why is Tesla, SpaceX, now X after Twitter, all these, the boring company, all these different [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=302.16s)]
*  things. Why has he been so incredible at it? It's because when everyone else says this can't be done, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=308.56s)]
*  this can't be fixed, somehow this guy fixes it. That we have him involved in trying to [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=314.0s)]
*  write our government and figure out where a lot of this money is going and where a lot of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=321.6s)]
*  bottlenecks are for transparency and where the bureaucracy has just huddled together and decided [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=326.96s)]
*  they're completely unaccountable, should be a dream come true. And here's the big problem, Megan. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=333.68s)]
*  It should be a bipartisan dream come true. This isn't for in any meaningful way a partisan issue, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=338.32s)]
*  meaning if Medicare is paying billions of dollars to straight-up fraudsters, not just here but [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=345.12s)]
*  overseas as well, which everyone has known this has been going on for years, no one's done anything [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=351.67999999999995s)]
*  about it. If Elon Musk can stop that, does anyone want to be in favor of it? Democrats have put [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=355.44s)]
*  themselves in a place where they have to root for the bad thing just because they want to oppose [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=361.92s)]
*  Trump, Elon, and everybody involved with them. And I think this is this cabinet meeting is a [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=368.08s)]
*  perfect example. He's talking about ending or limiting, bringing down the numbers on government [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=372.32s)]
*  fraud, waste, and abuse, and they're attacking this guy as if he isn't incredibly talented, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=377.84s)]
*  able, and capable of doing this, probably more so than, I don't know, anyone else on the planet. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=385.28s)]
*  So I think that they just dig the hole deeper. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=389.59999999999997s)]
*  Everybody said Twitter was going to close. Now it's efficient. It's got 20% of the staff it used to, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=390.88s)]
*  and it's a success. I want to continue down this line, and we'll talk more about what happened at [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=396.88s)]
*  the cabinet meeting, but just as an offshoot to Doge and what Elon's doing, one of the agencies [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=401.84s)]
*  he's been looking at obviously is USAID, this agency that we use to funnel all sorts of foreign [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=407.28s)]
*  aid to God knows whom. That's really what we're finding out, these pet causes of the Democrats [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=412.55999999999995s)]
*  that have been getting slush funded for years. And there was a hearing on this yesterday [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=418.4s)]
*  on Capitol Hillbuck. And listen to this exchange. You've got Representative Tim Burchett, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=424.55999999999995s)]
*  Republican of Tennessee, questioning now former USAID executives on where the money was going. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=429.68s)]
*  Listen to this. Mr. Roman, are you aware that we are sending $40 million a week to the Taliban? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=438.64s)]
*  Yes, sir. Can you name other instances of foreign aid going to terrorist organizations? [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=446.64s)]
*  We have assisted Al-Shabaab in Somalia. There's been instances of the Hamze network in Sudan, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=452.8s)]
*  Hamas, Islamic Jihad, Hezbollah, Qatari, Hezbollah, Hayat, Tahrir al-Sham in Syria. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=458.88s)]
*  Dozens of terror organizations have received indirect assistance. Let's use Gaza as our case [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=464.64s)]
*  study. $2.1 billion in American taxpayers' money to Gaza since October 7th when Hamas invaded [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=469.68s)]
*  southern Israel. Waivers were granted because they said that there was an emergency used to [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=475.36s)]
*  have that money come in to Gaza, thereby jettisoning the usual, typical screening procedures. As a [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=479.76s)]
*  result, 90% of aid that was going from the United States by way of its agents in Gaza ended up in [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=485.84s)]
*  Hamas-controlled areas. It seems like the emergency might have been armed terrorists to kill civilians. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=493.2s)]
*  Would that be accurate? That's accurate. And even more than that, Samantha Powers, the administrator [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=498.71999999999997s)]
*  for USAID, was intent on having Israel not be able to defend itself. They bring together groups [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=503.59999999999997s)]
*  in Washington that overseas work with groups that kill Americans. Yeah, I don't need a flow chart [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=509.84s)]
*  to show that. I appreciate it. International NGOs and UN agencies actively lobby here in Washington, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=515.2s)]
*  D.C. against vetting policies that would prevent it. I was the senior vetting officer at USAID. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=519.84s)]
*  We had a regulation before we left in the last administration that anybody who touches money in [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=526.08s)]
*  areas, in countries where there's terrorists, those names have to go through databases, terrorist [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=530.48s)]
*  databases. That was overturned by Biden. So that first guy's a think tank guy. That second guy was [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=534.88s)]
*  at USAID. It's unbelievable where this money's been going or funding Hamas. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=540.08s)]
*  Yes. Well, everyone was, I think, rightly outraged, although sometimes it was almost amusing if the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=546.64s)]
*  numbers weren't so high in terms of the wasted money for the transgender puppet shows in Mongolia [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=552.96s)]
*  and DEI theory in Guatemala and the things that everyone's paying for. That's one thing. It's [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  another thing, and I think even more egregious, to look at what was just being discussed there, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=565.04s)]
*  which is money being funneled to some of the most vicious and vile terrorist groups in the world [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=570.64s)]
*  under the guise of this somehow advancing U.S. interests. And that's what's key. USAID is not [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=576.64s)]
*  supposed to be a global charity. It is not a soup kitchen for the world. It is supposed to advance [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=582.9599999999999s)]
*  U.S. interests. And a lot of the stuff that Elon has exposed so far, Elon Doge has exposed, [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=590.3199999999999s)]
*  is frivolous and absurd. But some of those things, the expenditures, for example, going to Hamas and [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=598.3199999999999s)]
*  al-Shabaab in Somalia and some of these terrorist groups that I used to track when I was in the CIA [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=604.08s)]
*  years and years ago, and let me tell you, these are very, very bad individuals. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=608.88s)]
*  Some of this money is clearly working against U.S. interests and not being deployed in a way [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=612.4000000000001s)]
*  that would make any sense if the American people knew about it, which is, again, I think why [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=620.1600000000001s)]
*  a lot of the outrage is not just justified but entirely necessary. We can't have this happen [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=624.96s)]
*  going forward. You can't have- Why am I funding through this group Hamas's murder of Israeli [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=631.44s)]
*  babies? I object. I'm funding the murder of the Bebis boys. F you, anybody who supports this [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=638.96s)]
*  organization at this point. This is such an outrage that this was allowed to happen in the [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=646.88s)]
*  first place. For anyone to have the gall to object to the questioning of it now, nevermind the shutting [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=652.08s)]
*  down by Elon and Trump, they don't have their moral head on straight. This is outrage. The entire [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=659.12s)]
*  country should be up in arms that we've been doing this. Instead, we get ridiculous headlines [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=666.0s)]
*  like I just read to you about why Elon is at a cabinet meeting. It's infuriating, Buck. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=671.12s)]
*  You're right. What you said is right. They're more obsessed with being anti-Trump, anti-Elon [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=678.24s)]
*  than they are in figuring out what the true morality is of what's being exposed. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=684.64s)]
*  Yes, and they're showing also the American people how obtuse they are in their approach to this at [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=690.4000000000001s)]
*  every step of the way. These are not 50-50 issues. These are not even 60-40 issues. This is much more [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=697.0400000000001s)]
*  like an 80-20 where 20% of the far left of this country or the 20% that comprises it is in favor [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=704.0s)]
*  of, say, Hamas or they're in favor of trying to buy off terrorist groups with humanitarian aid. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=711.44s)]
*  The rest of the American people are saying, what the heck are you doing? This is completely [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=717.76s)]
*  insane. I would just say you've seen, I'm sure, Megan, I think everyone's seen now, these chat logs [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=721.8399999999999s)]
*  from inside of the NSA and the CIA. We haven't yet talked about that. Let me just set that up. [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=728.8s)]
*  Let me just set that up. Oh, sure. Sorry. Go ahead. Yeah. No, no. It broke the other day. Chris Ruffo, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=734.4799999999999s)]
*  who's an amazing force for good in the country, had a whistleblower come to him out of NSA saying, [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=740.16s)]
*  here are a bunch of texts from internal chat servers showing an obsession within our national [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=746.08s)]
*  security agencies with being trans, with gay sex, with calling themselves not just by the wrong [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=754.88s)]
*  pronouns but insisting that these random people who work for us in the highest levels of our [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=765.0400000000001s)]
*  intelligence agencies want to be known as it. I'm an it. I'm not even a he or a she. It's [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=768.48s)]
*  absolutely raunchy, disgusting talk. And the explanation is that they've gotten so obsessed [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=774.8000000000001s)]
*  with like Pride Month and the so-called tolerance of the LGBTQ crowd that this went on without fear [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=782.8000000000001s)]
*  on these company, these company internal chat forums until somebody just blew the whistle. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=790.48s)]
*  And Tulsi Gabbard actually said, everyone's getting fired who participated in that. I'll play that [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=797.44s)]
*  soundbite, stop one, and then you take it out. Well, Jesse, what we're going to do has already [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=801.68s)]
*  been done. There are over a hundred people from across the intelligence community that contributed [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=806.4s)]
*  to and participated in this. What is really just an egregious violation of trust, what to speak of, [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=812.16s)]
*  like basic rules and standards around professionalism. I put out a directive today that [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=818.4s)]
*  they all will be terminated and their security clearances will be revoked. They were brazen in [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=824.0s)]
*  using an NSA platform intended for professional use to conduct this kind of really, really [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=830.56s)]
*  horrific behavior. And they were brazen in doing this because when was the last time anyone was [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=839.1999999999999s)]
*  really held accountable? Today's action and holding these individuals accountable is just the beginning [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=844.4s)]
*  of what we're seeing across the Trump administration, which is carrying out the mandate the American [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=850.16s)]
*  people gave him. Clean house, root out that rot and corruption. Go ahead, Buck. Look, as you know, [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=854.5600000000001s)]
*  Megan, I worked in the CIA for a number of years. It's been a while, but I still have a lot of [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=863.9200000000001s)]
*  friends on the inside and people throughout the intelligence community. And what you're hearing [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=869.6800000000001s)]
*  about in terms of how left-wing and insane it is, this is just the tip of the iceberg. This has been [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=875.12s)]
*  going on for years. This is a systemic problem. This wasn't your internal chitchat when you were [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=881.68s)]
*  there. You were not discussing how great it would be to have an intersex baby so that you can raise [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=886.4s)]
*  him trans, like some of the messages here. An intersex birth would be a great opportunity to [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  raise a kid as a non-binary and let them choose later. This is when after they're discussing [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=897.12s)]
*  trans surgeries and their excitement about quote, being penetrated. That wasn't the chitchat you saw [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=903.3599999999999s)]
*  on the internal servers back then. No, we were trying to find Osama bin Laden. I mean, literally [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=909.36s)]
*  trying to find Osama bin Laden. That was my job. I was in CTC in the CIA's Counterterrorism Center. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=914.88s)]
*  And there was a sense, now remember I was there in the early, you know, starting around 2005. So [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=921.04s)]
*  there was a very clear mission set. You had us working very closely with military, including [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=924.96s)]
*  tier one strike units going after the worst of the worst. But starting around the Obama era, [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=931.28s)]
*  which is when I left, things started to shift and they got very adept. And this is kind of a longer [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=937.12s)]
*  narrative, but these agencies, and this is why I was thinking about it when we were talking about [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=942.4s)]
*  USAID a moment ago, these agencies have really mirrored what you saw happen, Megan, in the [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=946.32s)]
*  university system, where it's almost like an invasive species in nature gets a foothold and [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=952.8s)]
*  then takes over an entire ecosystem and blocks out all the other species. What you have is people [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=960.08s)]
*  inside of the federal bureaucracy who are radical left partisans. And this usually comes through [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=966.72s)]
*  HR, the DEI office, the left-wing commissars, if you will, they start to demand certain policies. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=972.96s)]
*  They start to hire certain kinds of people. They create a pipeline for more of this madness. Just [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=980.08s)]
*  like how we saw the faculty lounges across America, even at the most elite universities, [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=986.1600000000001s)]
*  just have gone completely insane over the last 20 years. You could say it's maybe longer than that. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=990.6400000000001s)]
*  This has happened throughout the intelligence community too. And when you don't have people [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=995.36s)]
*  showing up, you know, you had this post 9-11 generation, which I was a part of, where we're [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1000.5600000000001s)]
*  just saying our country's under attack, let's fight Al-Qaeda. Okay, that's why a whole wave joined. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1004.64s)]
*  If you join the CIA in the last 10 years, a lot of people are joining and they had to mouth the [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1009.76s)]
*  preferred slogans of the DEI commissars about things like the trans agenda. I have friends in [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1015.36s)]
*  the CIA who say that it feels like it's trans awareness week every other week in the central [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1021.52s)]
*  intelligence agency. And when you look at the issue of security clearances, which Tulsi Gabbard [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1026.48s)]
*  there brought up, these are not just people who are doing some, you know, they're not working [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1032.72s)]
*  in the bowels of the department of agriculture. They're being entrusted with top secret and [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1037.84s)]
*  compartmented information and they're clearly nuts. And this needs to be said, these people, [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1042.48s)]
*  when I applied to the CIA, it was, you know, what, do you have any gambling debts? You know, [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1048.4s)]
*  what kind of credit card debt do you have? You know, what kind of relationships do you have, [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1053.2800000000002s)]
*  you know, with women, anyone overseas? I mean, they ask you all these very invasive questions, [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1057.52s)]
*  but apparently if you want to have a hermaphrodite baby to run some kind of social experiment where [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1063.44s)]
*  you can raise them as the perfect trans kid and want everybody else to be on board for this, [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1067.8400000000001s)]
*  the NSA has a special spot for you. This, what is being shown here is critical that people [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1072.24s)]
*  figure out what the heck has happened here. The Wesleyan faculty lounge is now running [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1078.32s)]
*  the CIA, the NSA and these places and it needs to stop. It has gone on far too long. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1084.0s)]
*  Just to give a little bit more from the Rufo reporting, Rufo had like an epic post on this, [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1091.04s)]
*  which summed it up as follows. There is a battalion of male to female transgender, [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1096.1599999999999s)]
*  transgenders within the American Intel apparatus. They hate Italians and libs of TikTok. They [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1101.6799999999998s)]
*  fantasize about pseudo vaginas and butthole lasers. They are in charge of the most sophisticated [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1107.44s)]
*  spying machine in human history. Well said. Here's a couple of examples. One, I mean, honestly, [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1112.64s)]
*  the rest is nice too, talking about transgender surgeries, wearing panties without worrying about [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1118.3200000000002s)]
*  anything showing, seeing my reflection in the mirror, wearing leggings, et cetera. But the P [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1122.8s)]
*  thing is something I never thought of, but it's really nice. Then I'm going to be wearing leggings [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1127.3600000000001s)]
*  all day, Friday and Saturday. I think about that last one probably the most, uh, blah, blah, blah. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1131.76s)]
*  Mine is everything. I found that I like being penetrated. Never liked it before, GRS, but all [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1136.8s)]
*  the rest is just as important as well. And then all I can say is that this was 1 million percent [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1142.3999999999999s)]
*  worth it. Despite having to fly to Thailand, pay out of pocket and the recovery, I would not change [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1148.24s)]
*  anything if I had to do it all over again. And then the whistleblower says to Rufo, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1153.12s)]
*  I know several people at the agency brought up, um, hey, we're here to fight for the USA and go [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1159.2s)]
*  after adversaries. And they just got hammered. They would start coming out with transphobe and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1166.0s)]
*  homophobe right away or calling you a racist. The guy goes on or gal saying, I don't care if [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1171.28s)]
*  you're politically left or right. You can't have an unbiased mind if you're writing a report and [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1177.36s)]
*  you're constantly focused on how does this apply to gender ideology? Because when you do that, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1180.8s)]
*  it's going to get people killed in the field. That's a good point. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1185.36s)]
*  Yes. Well, this is why it's, it's a very serious business that the intelligence community does. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1190.96s)]
*  And it's, uh, it's sad to see what it has turned into in terms of the reputation. Remember the FBI [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1195.6000000000001s)]
*  is part of the intelligence community. I think there's now 17 agencies that fall, uh, under the [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1201.04s)]
*  umbrella overall. I can't even name them all off the top of my head. And I used to be a part of it. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1207.2s)]
*  And that's because they've added a few since I was in there. Uh, but they do have a very serious [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1210.72s)]
*  mission. It's bloated, it's ineffective. It's become incredibly, uh, DEI obsessed. All of that [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1215.2s)]
*  is very true, but you actually do need somebody to keep an eye on what the Russian SVR is doing. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1220.96s)]
*  You actually do need somebody looking at the transcripts of whatever the latest, you know, [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1226.64s)]
*  sat phone call is from Al Shabaab to some terrorist group that is trying to blow, you know, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1231.92s)]
*  to their terrorist cell that's trying to blow up an embassy or something somewhere. So this is a [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1236.72s)]
*  critical mission that they have. And, and a huge part of this is the, the sense of a esprit de corps [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1240.48s)]
*  that the workforce has, which I will tell you was there, uh, under the Bush years, when I was in the [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1247.36s)]
*  CIA, there was a sense of, we know why we're showing up every day. It wasn't perfect. It was [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1252.3999999999999s)]
*  sometimes bureaucratic and slow and there were challenges, but people were deploying to war zones. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1256.9599999999998s)]
*  People were doing high level missions and interesting stuff that has just changed. And it [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1261.84s)]
*  changed, like I said, the same way, so many of these government institutions, the moment that you [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1266.56s)]
*  have changed, the moment that you start to bend the knee to this madness, to the point about, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1271.84s)]
*  you know, who are these people and why are they demanding that you not focus on national security [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1276.4s)]
*  for the country and they're inside the intelligence community. The moment you start to bend the knee, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1282.0800000000002s)]
*  they just demand more. And if you're somebody who says, who tries to blow the whistle on them, [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1285.76s)]
*  by the way, before Trump came along in this administration, if you try to do that, do that [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1290.88s)]
*  under the Biden years, you were the problem. You know, everyone always says it's impossible to get [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1295.52s)]
*  fired from the federal government. If you were on the wrong side of the DEI gods, oh man, bad [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1299.8400000000001s)]
*  things. And again, I know because I've talked to people who have had this happen to them. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1305.12s)]
*  If you said something that offended somebody who is trans or whatever in the office, you'll be lucky [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1310.08s)]
*  if they don't send you to the HR re-education camp right away. Trans people should not be serving in [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1316.4799999999998s)]
*  the intelligence community in this way. I'm sorry, there's too much of a mental question about their [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1322.56s)]
*  abilities for them to be this close to the nuclear controls and fighting our enemies. This is just, [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1328.32s)]
*  I don't think this is an appropriate place for them. [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1334.24s)]
*  Yes. No, I completely agree with you. And the CIA in these places are notoriously hard, particularly [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1336.56s)]
*  the CIA is incredibly hard to get hired by, or at least it used to be. I don't know how it is these [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1342.64s)]
*  days. And there was a really rigorous process. And like I said, there was all of this incredibly [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1347.36s)]
*  intrusive and some of it I can't even get into because technically it's not something that I [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1354.72s)]
*  can speak about publicly. But they're allowed to know basically everything about your life [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1359.2s)]
*  to look for any weakness in you that could be exploited by a foreign intelligence service. [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1363.84s)]
*  And we've got people, I mean, like the stuff that you're, I'm not one to blush that easily, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1369.04s)]
*  Megan. The stuff you're reading about that Chris Ruffo found, I had to look up some of this stuff. [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1373.9199999999998s)]
*  I don't even know what some of these words are. I didn't know what Poly-Q was. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1378.72s)]
*  I've got a whole laser across the Rubicon. [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1382.32s)]
*  And to your point, this is supposed to be the most elite of the entire national security [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1385.04s)]
*  intelligence apparatus. You're talking about CIA and NSA. Those are really the flagship agencies, [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1391.36s)]
*  no offense to anybody from the other ones. But the fact that you have people wasting their time, [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1395.9199999999998s)]
*  and also just the brazenness, they're on a company server. I won't even say that Dolores [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1400.32s)]
*  from accounting looks nice in her dress on a company server. Do you know what I'm saying? [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1406.32s)]
*  We've had to live by such different rules. The people who show up and want to do the real mission [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1411.9199999999998s)]
*  are living in constant fear of, oh, you know, did I mansplain or something? And yet on the other [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1417.04s)]
*  side of things, you're allowed to be recruiting for your bizarre trans fantasies. It's crazy stuff. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1422.56s)]
*  And so I'm glad Ruffo found it. But again, this has been far more widespread. This is the thing [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1429.2s)]
*  about Doge too. It's the thing about the, you know, the Ruffo leak of these chats. This is tip of the [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1434.32s)]
*  iceberg. We're just beginning to see this because they have taken over these federal institutions. [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1440.48s)]
*  Once you control HR and the hiring and internal enforcement mechanism, just look at the colleges, [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1445.92s)]
*  just look, this is happening in big law firms now. This is why everyone's putting the pronouns until [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1453.28s)]
*  now in their signature. This is why everyone's been hiding from insane people. It's finally stopping, [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1458.0s)]
*  thank God. But I'm just trying to tell everybody this is opening innings. It's not like, oh, we've [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1464.16s)]
*  just, we've found it and now the problem can be fixed. There's a lot more of this stuff that [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1468.16s)]
*  you're going to see. Well, here's a, here's a very insightful look at why Trump and Elon are [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1472.56s)]
*  actually taking a hard look at all these government agencies from, yes, the NSA and the Intel agencies [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1479.28s)]
*  to USAID to try to figure out who, who's not doing what they're supposed to be doing and where can [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1485.9199999999998s)]
*  we find efficiencies and in coordination with people like Tulsi, like Pete, like all the agency [[00:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1491.44s)]
*  heads to figure out what are the problems in personnel? Like, let's just start there by cleaning [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1496.8s)]
*  up the personnel. So here's an insightful take we got last night on CNN with this, another racist, [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1501.44s)]
*  this guy, he's a race baiter. He lost his show on MSNBC. It was too much for them years ago named [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1506.88s)]
*  Ture, but now has been resurrected over on CNN where they're taking their rejects from MSNBC. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1511.92s)]
*  Good luck, Joy. Give it a try. Having an exchange with Scott Jennings as follows. [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1518.0800000000002s)]
*  How is Trump shredding the constitution? My God, he's a couple of, should we go to [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1524.0800000000002s)]
*  seriously? We have to give you a civics lesson that we have, that we have, that we've, that we've [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1528.24s)]
*  put all power in the executive branch, the legislative branch, the FBI, now we're in control of the [[00:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1533.36s)]
*  military, silencing media. This is what you do in a dictatorship. Are you suggesting that the president [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1539.1200000000001s)]
*  is not the commander in chief of the military? I am suggesting that the president is going to put [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1546.4s)]
*  in charge somebody who is going to contravene the constitution and at some near point, this conversation [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1550.56s)]
*  will look very silly for you because it would be obvious. And right now you're gaslighting. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1556.16s)]
*  He's going to get to the actual brother of the road of this. It will be clear. I'm interested [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1560.24s)]
*  in this conversation. He's going to put someone in charge who will contravene the constant. Like who? [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1564.4s)]
*  What do you mean by that? The president is in charge of the military. Is he not? [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  You said he's going to put someone in charge of the military. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1574.0s)]
*  The president is in charge of the military. That is how it works. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1576.48s)]
*  Meanwhile, this Ture looks very confused. What do you mean? Why are you saying he's in charge of [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1581.52s)]
*  the military? I would take my point, which is whatever he does with the military is unconstitutional. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1585.12s)]
*  This goes right to why we are in the midst of, and Megan, I'll be honest, I didn't know that we would [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1591.36s)]
*  ever get here because it feels like it's been forever. I've been doing media now, left the CIA, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1597.28s)]
*  I've been doing media for almost 15 years, and there just were these edifices of these institutions, [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1603.9199999999998s)]
*  monoliths of so-called journalism, whether it's CNN, the New York Times, the Washington Post, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1611.84s)]
*  and it's all in freefall right now. It should be because they've lied so much. They've been so [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1617.4399999999998s)]
*  dishonest, whether it was the covering up or Biden dementia, which we may get to. I know that's [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1625.12s)]
*  another thing that everyone's looking at right now, but they've lied on so many things. The biggest [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1629.9199999999998s)]
*  thing that I think they have to deal with right now is what is their purpose? The purpose of CNN, [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1634.8s)]
*  the purpose of the New York Times, the Washington Post, is not to tell people the objective truth. [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1640.72s)]
*  We know that, and anybody who still believes that is truly delusional, and there are very few people [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1645.68s)]
*  who believe it. Beyond that, they can't even say that their purpose is to serve the interests [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1650.32s)]
*  well of the Democrat Party because they humiliated their own audience. As you know, this is [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1656.56s)]
*  among the cardinal sins of doing any kind of, whether it's journalism, commentary. If you're [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1663.76s)]
*  audience turns on you because you've turned on them, it's all over. This is 101 most basic stuff. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1670.64s)]
*  They've ridiculed their own audience because everything that they told them would come true [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1677.5200000000002s)]
*  did not come true. All of the fear-mongering is now clearly just hysteria about Trump and he's [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1682.64s)]
*  going to end the Constitution. It's the end of the country, and all these horrible things will happen, [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1688.96s)]
*  and we need to prosecute him, and he's a rapist, and he's at this, and he's at that. All lies. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1692.64s)]
*  All lies. I think that there's a core group of them. I used to watch ... This is actually a guilty [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1697.1200000000001s)]
*  pleasure of mine, Megan. I watched Morning Joe for about the 90 days leading up to election day every [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1702.72s)]
*  day. Same. I would listen to the podcast just to see what insanity was being spewed. [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1710.0s)]
*  They were so crazy. I don't know how they even had the energy. Every morning it was Mika like, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1715.3600000000001s)]
*  the Nazis and Trump and Joe, oh yeah, I know. I just got off the grass courts over at the country [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1722.16s)]
*  club, and let me tell you, I'm really worried. The whole thing was just ... It was just vomit on [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1728.72s)]
*  toast, man. It was preposterous. Yeah, and they fully played the Hitler card until he bent the knee [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1734.16s)]
*  at Mar-a-Lago, both of them, and kissed Hitler's ring. I said, oh, what do you mean? It's totally [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1738.24s)]
*  normal for us to do that. But this is a perfect example. This is what I mean, Megan. If you're a [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1742.64s)]
*  Morning Joe, not kind of mock ... I was a mockery watcher, but if you were really watching them, [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1746.24s)]
*  what do you have? What do they stand for? What are they doing for you now? If you were their [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1752.64s)]
*  true audience, and I think this is true of the New York Times, the Washington Post, and all these [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1756.56s)]
*  places now as well, they created an alternate reality for these people to live in, and that [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1760.08s)]
*  reality has come crashing down, which is why Joy Reid has to get fired, and I think The View is [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1764.72s)]
*  maybe going to have to make some shakeup soon, and why Jeff Bezos has told the Washington Post [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1769.92s)]
*  to stop being insane. You're not actually allowed to be communist anymore. Sort of. [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1774.32s)]
*  This is the necessary reckoning that the traditional corporate legacy media is having [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1781.52s)]
*  right now, and you're even seeing parts of it on CNN. That Torrey guy, I mean, that's an argument [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1787.28s)]
*  that was stupid six months ago, and it's been annoying for eight years, but no one believes [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1792.0s)]
*  this now. No one actually thinks ... I mean, when I say nobody, the people who believe it will believe [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1798.96s)]
*  absolutely anything. Well, yeah, I mean, at some point, even the MSNBC audience has got to get [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1803.04s)]
*  tired about being wrong about everything. It's just embarrassing if you just keep taking [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1808.24s)]
*  Rachel Maddow's information, repeating it in the public, and then have your pants effectively [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1812.3999999999999s)]
*  pulled down on you. You've made a clown out of yourself. Let's spend a minute on The Washington [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1817.6s)]
*  Post. So Jeff Bezos, I find this interesting. Of course, The Washington Post is hard left now, [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1822.8s)]
*  and has been for some time, since the first Trump presidency, at least. And he's owned it for almost [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1830.72s)]
*  all of that time. And now he shows up at the inauguration. He, like the other tech titans, [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1837.68s)]
*  made a big donation to the Trump inauguration fund. He's got his half-dressed fiance there, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1843.52s)]
*  two steps from the president as he takes the oath of office, because now he wants to be [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1849.1200000000001s)]
*  near power. He wants to curry favor with the sitting president. So he both gave money and [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1853.68s)]
*  paraded a naked woman in front of President Trump. And now the third move is he's changing [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1858.88s)]
*  the editorial policy on The Washington Post opinion page. He writes this long message on X, [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1865.92s)]
*  which reads in part as follows. We are going to be writing every day in support of and in defense [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1872.24s)]
*  of two pillars, personal liberties. My interpretation of that is the Bill of Rights and free markets, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1877.2s)]
*  free markets, meaning capitalism and not government control of everything in our economy. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=1885.12s)]

*  This guy was a self-described Marxist, by the way, so it wasn't really a surprise. October 7th, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2190.56s)]

*  dumb that they don't understand that Israel is actually a multi-ethnic society. The 20% of Israel [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2214.08s)]

*  at the Washington Post. This is the point. That kind of mentality until now was absolutely supported [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2235.76s)]

*  I don't believe him for one second. I believe his critics who say this is about saving and [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2256.24s)]
*  currying advantage for his other businesses like Amazon, which is potentially facing an [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2262.3999999999996s)]

*  that he's committed to anything different than what he's been doing. I believe the people who [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2306.0s)]
*  say he's worried about his other businesses. Go ahead, Buck. Yeah, no, I mean just anti-white [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2309.92s)]
*  solidarity has been a weapon used by the left, by the Democrat progressives with reckless [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2314.56s)]

*  someone a racist in the 90s, oh I'm so sorry, into the 2000s and then they elevated it and it became [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2344.8799999999997s)]
*  white supremacist. That was the next, I mean, remember when a white supremacist was like a [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2350.9599999999996s)]

*  the White House announced this week that they are going to decide who's in the White House press [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2574.64s)]
*  pool, not the press. Now, the press pool for those listening at home is a group of representatives [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2578.16s)]
*  from television, radio, yes now streaming, and print reporters, usually a wire service like AP [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2584.08s)]
*  or Reuters. And it's a small group of representatives from each one of those realms of media that gets to [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2591.44s)]
*  follow the president around at all times in the more, not in like the residence of the White House, [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2597.9199999999996s)]
*  but like in the more intimate spaces like the Oval or on the trips. You're not going to take [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2602.64s)]
*  everybody who's in that press briefing room with you when you're the president of the United States, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2607.12s)]
*  but pool, if you're part of pool, you get to go and it is your responsibility to report everything [[00:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2610.7999999999997s)]
*  he does back to all the other media and the public. And the pool reporting job is very important. [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2616.48s)]
*  The pool is the reason we saw Ronald Reagan get shot. They were covering Ronald Reagan. I mean, [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2623.92s)]
*  he wasn't doing anything extraordinary that day, but pool was there because they always have eyes [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2629.04s)]
*  on the president. Pool was there covering even, you know, President Trump when he got shot before [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2632.32s)]
*  he actually got reelected in Butler, Pennsylvania. Pool has to be there. And as a former reporter [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2637.1200000000003s)]
*  at Fox News, and I did White House duty when I was in my very young years there, here and there, [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2643.04s)]
*  pool is like a serious responsibility. You can't fuck up pool. Like you really do have to get it [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2649.84s)]
*  right. And typically the media will decide who can do pool because it's very expensive. And everybody [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2653.44s)]
*  understands it's important that you get somebody in there who's really going to tell you what [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2659.68s)]
*  happened. So I will say for the record, I don't know how I feel about the White House saying, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2662.4s)]
*  we're not now going to decide who's in pool. It's not the same as saying we're going to bring in new [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2667.2s)]
*  voices to the press briefing room. I love all that, but I actually happen to believe the media [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2671.8399999999997s)]
*  should decide who's in pool. Like because it's a matter of resources, it's just the TV lane alone. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2677.36s)]
*  And they seem to be saying TV will not change. TV will decide who's doing TV. But the number of [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2682.16s)]
*  wires you've got to get in there to get the cameras ready, getting an experienced photog in [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2686.96s)]
*  there to make sure he gets moments like, God forbid there's a presidential assassination attempt. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2690.7200000000003s)]
*  Like you can't fuck around with that. You need true pros who've got a lot of experience, [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2694.64s)]
*  setting up a shot, being ready for breaking news. I speak only from the TV realm because [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2700.64s)]
*  that's the one I know. I got questions about this before I really endorse it or criticize it, but [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2704.48s)]
*  the media is in a full on meltdown over it. And what they're upset about is that they, [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2711.28s)]
*  the vaunted media, are starting to lose more and more control about how Trump gets covered [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2716.8s)]
*  and in what way he gets covered. And the more I've been looking at the people objecting, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2723.28s)]
*  the more I've been recoiling because the absurdity of some of these people trying to say like, [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2727.28s)]
*  we are the vaunted media who cannot be told what to do. The head of the White House Correspondence [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2734.4s)]
*  Association is a guy named Eugene Daniels. He worked for Politico up until like yesterday. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2740.7200000000003s)]
*  Politico. Now he's leaving to go to MSNBC. Okay. This guy, we just pulled his social media. He is [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2746.0800000000004s)]
*  all over his social media in dresses, trying to look like Beyonce. This is a former college [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2752.6400000000003s)]
*  football player. Look at this guy. This is the one who's now our press representative at the [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2758.0s)]
*  White House. Look, look at this. For the listening audience, he's wearing a Beyonce blonde wig with [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2764.24s)]
*  his very large body, sticking his ass out, trying to look sexy, half man, half woman. This, okay. [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2769.68s)]
*  And it's also the same guy who accused Brian Kilmeade of racism when he was talking about [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2777.76s)]
*  Kamala Harris going back to her college sorority. And this guy said, Brian said, colored sorority [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2783.76s)]
*  and ran with that breathlessly to the press, trying to embarrass Brian Kilmeade. [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2789.92s)]
*  Meanwhile, what an absurd thing for Brian Kilmeade to be accused of. He's been on the air for how many [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2793.5200000000004s)]
*  years. He doesn't talk like that. We all know that. And even this guy was forced to dial it back. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2797.92s)]
*  But what do you make of what's happening now as the press and press pool tries to pretend [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2802.6400000000003s)]
*  they cannot be messed with, they're above it all. All we need to do is respect and honor them. [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2807.5200000000004s)]
*  So I have two main feelings about this one. And I'll sort of start with your stated concern, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2813.76s)]
*  which I think you preface properly as we don't know yet. But the stated concern is, well, [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2820.88s)]
*  maybe this won't be it's an important job. And if the media doesn't decide it won't be handled as [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2826.2400000000002s)]
*  well. What I would say to that is this team that Trump has brought in is the protein. You know, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2831.28s)]
*  I know them pretty much all personally, you know, talking with the different cabinet members, [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2838.48s)]
*  not all of them, but you know, I'd say 75%, 80% of them. I know you do too. These are very capable, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2844.16s)]
*  competent people that are making these decisions. You know, Stephen Miller, deputy White House [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2851.76s)]
*  Chief of Staff is an absolutely brilliant guy. I mean, you look at Caroline Levitt, I know she's [[00:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2856.8s)]
*  young. She is a superstar. And I know that too, because before she was on the Trump campaign, [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2861.68s)]
*  we tried to hire her for something over at at I heart. So, you know, there she these are very [[00:47:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2866.64s)]
*  talented people. And I think Megan, they've they should be given the room to cook, you know, [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2873.6s)]
*  they should be given the ability to handle it their way. If there are problems with the pool, [[00:47:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2879.12s)]
*  you and I know we'll hear about it. So I think they can figure this out is what is kind of [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2884.3199999999997s)]
*  what I see this. The other thing about this that makes me somewhat uncomfortable, and I'm, [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2888.72s)]
*  I'm all for pushing back on left wing bias. I don't have to prove that to anybody. But [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2892.56s)]
*  I do think the independence of the press is important. I realize the press has lost its mind, [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2896.64s)]
*  but it's written right into the Bill of Rights that you have free press is one of our most [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2901.52s)]
*  fundamental values. And I'm not sure I'm comfortable with the White House saying, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2906.64s)]
*  this is who will cover me. This is who I will allow to cover me at all. It's one thing to say [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2911.3599999999997s)]
*  to the AP, F you, you don't you lost your right to be in these intimate spaces. But there is a [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2917.8399999999997s)]
*  difference in saying, we will decide not you members of the press, who gets to come into every [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2923.76s)]
*  space and ask questions of the president. I mean, we could be in a Democrat administration next, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2929.28s)]
*  where they're like, nobody other than MSNBC and, you know, the the AP can have access. [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2935.6800000000003s)]
*  I think you and ask questions. I think your example there is the what we've what we've dealt with, [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2943.0400000000004s)]
*  with all Democrat administrations, which is that you effectively have regime, you have the regime [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2949.2000000000003s)]
*  picking regime media to cover the regime. And that's the giant is always in there. Fox is always [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2953.6s)]
*  in the situation. This White House is not they haven't thrown out all left wing media. It's [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2958.24s)]
*  almost still the pool that they want dominant left wing media. I'm just saying the principle of it, [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2963.44s)]
*  if we're going to discuss the principle of it, we're on dangerous ground here. [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2968.96s)]
*  Look, it's all there. I absolutely admit there are complexities here. And and I also do want [[00:49:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2973.52s)]
*  there to be look, I think that there should be no matter how much somebody loves what this [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2980.08s)]
*  administration is doing. And I'm very frank about this. I thought the beginning of the Trump first [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2984.24s)]
*  term, and I think Trump admit, I mean, Trump admitted this, he stopped talking about it. [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2988.64s)]
*  It was messy. They were screwing things up. They didn't have the right people in place. And [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2993.52s)]
*  I bring it up. I don't think that's the case this time around. And I'm it's even gone beyond my [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=2998.4s)]
*  expectations. But put that aside for a second. I think that no matter what you want there to be [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3002.4s)]
*  a degree of at least objectivity in the facts and in the sense of getting facts about what's [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3008.0s)]
*  going on day to day about an administration, because you want them to have you want people [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3013.92s)]
*  to have some ability to judge what's really going on. Now, that all said, I also think, Megan, that [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3018.32s)]
*  these that this role of the press pool and you said you had done this. So just I never know more [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3024.0s)]
*  about that. I did White House reporting. Right. I mean, you but you know, you've been covering the [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3030.48s)]
*  White House. I've never I've never done that role. Right. So I don't want to go beyond what I know. [[00:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3034.32s)]
*  But I do think it's quite clear that President Trump is sharing thoughts directly with the people [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3039.1200000000003s)]
*  via Twitter or truth on a daily basis. I think the access that we all have to information, [[00:50:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3046.56s)]
*  it's not like if there isn't some courts, I mean, not court, some press stenographer who's standing [[00:50:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3054.0s)]
*  there writing it down, we're not necessarily going to know what's happening. I think that the [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3059.76s)]
*  agree with that. But that's different. That's different. President Trump is more accessible [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3064.08s)]
*  to the press than any president I've ever seen. I mean, every day he sits down and gives an hour [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3067.12s)]
*  long. How do we understand what's the worry? But what's the word? Because let's well, let's just say, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3071.84s)]
*  let's I mean, I'm thinking like, pick some random blogger in your head. I don't want to insult [[00:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3076.4s)]
*  anybody by naming a name, but just pick some random successful online sub stack, reporter or [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3080.24s)]
*  podcast host whose pool that day and is supposed to be reporting on the president's agenda or [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3086.96s)]
*  his whereabouts. And let's say some major breaking news happens. And that person happens to have a [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3093.84s)]
*  more partisan agenda, which is fine in our daily media, but you know, a somewhat risky for pool. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3097.6800000000003s)]
*  Like I certainly wouldn't want to receive a report that is openly partisan. It's bad enough when I [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3103.04s)]
*  have to receive one that's subtly partisan from the AP. And so I as a reporter who wants straight [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3107.76s)]
*  facts would be like, okay, I don't really want a political pundit, somebody who's in the business [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3114.0s)]
*  of spinning in their running pool for me. I really don't. And I realize we're now we're talking [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3118.96s)]
*  fine lines here because the AP is in the business of spinning. That's why we need a variety. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3124.48s)]
*  But I'm saying that there are responsibilities when you're like the sole pool reporter, [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3129.6s)]
*  like at times there's one pool reporter who we depend on to tell us what happened to the [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3134.08s)]
*  president, like what happened, who shot him, who did. And I do think there needs to be a basic [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3139.04s)]
*  minimum standard of having had experience covering the president, having covered the White House, [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3144.08s)]
*  coming from an institution that can cover the costs. By the way, you can't be in pool [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3148.08s)]
*  unless you can cover your own costs, which can be over a hundred thousand dollars a year. [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3151.6s)]
*  Again, I think the problem, Megan, I mean, everything you're saying, I hear you and it [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3155.7599999999998s)]
*  makes sense and it's very rational, but it's like we're assessing a problem that hasn't occurred yet, [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3161.36s)]
*  meaning that they may pick people who are highly competent and do an excellent job. And so that's [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3167.52s)]
*  what I meant by they've brought in the A team so far. So I'm not as- [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3172.48s)]
*  Why should they get to choose? Why should they get to choose as opposed to the press? [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3175.28s)]
*  Because I think the press has shown itself to be, I think the whole notion of an objective [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3180.0800000000004s)]
*  journalism or objective media is a farce and has always been. [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3184.8s)]
*  I agree. I agree. But it's not for the president to decide who gets to cover him. [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3187.76s)]
*  We will cover him because we are the press. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3191.6000000000004s)]
*  But who's we? But who gets to decide? See, this is the problem, Megan. There's a cartel [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3193.76s)]
*  that has existed. The White House Correspondence Association, this I do know a little bit about, [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3197.6000000000004s)]
*  having gone to one of their balls, by the way, and thought it was most boring and self-important [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3201.84s)]
*  and annoying thing ever and never went back. But knowing some of the people involved in that, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3205.12s)]
*  they, why should they get to choose? And that's been the case for a long time. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3210.0s)]
*  So I don't understand- Because it's the White House press [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3214.88s)]
*  Association. It's the Correspondence Association. Why? Like it's one thing everybody- [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3217.52s)]
*  It's like a country club for left-wing jerks. Look, and I had no problem with him throwing out [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3221.7599999999998s)]
*  the AP. But it's different when the president is saying, I get to choose who's going to cover me. [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3223.3599999999997s)]
*  I'll choose the whole list. Once you say you can do that, then he can say only Fox and Newsmax. [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3230.64s)]
*  He could. If we're saying that's an okay thing to do, he could say that. And then the next president [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3236.7999999999997s)]
*  could say only MSNBC and NBC or AP. I think when it gets to who goes into that pool and who is [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3241.52s)]
*  responsible for the full-time coverage of the president whenever and whenever he's in the public, [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3249.44s)]
*  it should be up to the press who's on that duty. But who's the press, Megan? We keep [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3255.68s)]
*  coming back to this. Well, in this situation, it's the White House Correspondence Association. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3260.48s)]
*  Right. I know. And who determines who's in that and why has that been the case? [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3263.76s)]
*  Well, I mean, are you- Like Fox News is in it. Jackie Henrik has been out there all week saying, [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3268.0s)]
*  this is not a good idea. You don't understand what goes into pool. I mean, do you know what [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3271.76s)]
*  goes into pool? I'm not saying there aren't good people. Most people have no idea. [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3275.52s)]
*  I'm not saying there aren't good people who are part of it. And by the way, Fox's presence there, [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3278.48s)]
*  which a lot of times, as you know, they have been the only voice and they don't get called on that [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3282.48s)]
*  much. And so there's always the table is not set or level rather. Right. Like there's been [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3286.48s)]
*  starting to be doing that's gone on even. But look, Trump, the notion that Trump is going to [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3291.2s)]
*  shy away from he loves how many times did he sit down with Maggie Haberman? Why are they controlling [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3296.64s)]
*  pool? Because they're I think they're going to have a good mix of different people in there. [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3301.76s)]
*  I think that there's an assumption that's being made that it's only going to be people that the [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3306.72s)]
*  that the left wing Democrat media is going to freak out about. You know, it's not just I don't [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3311.36s)]
*  want to like say anybody throw them under the bus, but it's not just going to be like Daily [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3315.84s)]
*  Caller and Breitbart in there. There'll be other people involved in the coverage. And I think Trump [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3318.8s)]
*  wants to add to it. Then that's fine. Then you add two more seats and pool. Maybe you have like [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3324.0s)]
*  seven representatives normally. Now you have nine. But I just think there's a lot that goes into [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3328.32s)]
*  following the president of the United States around all day, every day on foreign trips and so on. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3333.76s)]
*  And I really think there's something to both a having people do it from institutions that [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3339.2000000000003s)]
*  completely have a doubt. You don't know how many meetings go down. I've been in them at Fox [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3345.28s)]
*  on the number of things you have to have in line to make sure you miss nothing. The tech support [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3349.52s)]
*  you have to do to make sure that you have the cameras in place and so on. That's one. And I [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3354.1600000000003s)]
*  also look as much as we like President Trump, there is a line between the press and the president. And [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3358.1600000000003s)]
*  he does not control the media. I traveled with Pompeo once in his press pool, and it was a bunch [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3363.52s)]
*  of left wing cat ladies who hated his guts. So I mean, I just think that this is, you know, [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3369.28s)]
*  that's the truth. So I don't know that this is necessarily the vaunted institution that we need [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3373.92s)]
*  to keep going. Now that was Secretary of State, not the president. That's why I talk about this guy, [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3380.72s)]
*  Eugene Daniels. Like this is what we're dealing with. But realistically, if you saw the way they [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3384.72s)]
*  organized this thing, it takes a lot. And you cannot take an organization that doesn't have a [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3389.92s)]
*  lot of resources or experience and make them the ones we're dependent on to cover massive events. [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3395.3599999999997s)]
*  We got to come back to this, because I think in time you're going to say that they surprise you [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3401.6s)]
*  with how well they handled this. But if I'm wrong, I will come on here and give you a mea culpa. [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3405.12s)]
*  Yeah. Well, listen, I think my audience knows I'm not a knee jerk defender of the press. [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3409.7599999999998s)]
*  But I'm not a knee jerk defender of the president either. And there is an important role for an [[00:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3415.28s)]
*  independent press in this country. That's why it's in the First Amendment. And there are limits to [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3421.84s)]
*  the controls that can be placed on them. And so while I think it's a great idea to expand access [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3427.76s)]
*  and make sure we get new voices in there, I don't think the president is in a position to tell us [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3434.32s)]
*  who gets to cover him the entirety of the list, which is the difference between saying AP, you're [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3440.0s)]
*  out and saying we determine all of who is in. To me, there's a difference there. All right. Anyway, [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3445.44s)]
*  we used our time on the media, but it was an interesting discussion. And Buck, it's always [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bGt4C2dxm2E&t=3451.76s)]
