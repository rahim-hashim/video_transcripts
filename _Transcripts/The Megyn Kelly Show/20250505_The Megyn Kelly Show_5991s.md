Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by The Daily Wire's Andrew Klavan, author of "The Kingdom of Cain," to discuss ridiculous elites at the Met Gala, the focus on “black male fashion” this year, out-of-touch celebs like Anna Wintour trying to play the woke game to avoid cultural and social backlash, how American culture is shifting away from leftist drift, how our society is breaking and why “ideology is death to art,” the increase in sexually explicit content in our culture, the false narratives from Trump’s Meet the Press interview on NBC and his "I don't know" comment, the truth about how Trump said he'd follow what the Supreme Court rules, the media spin about immigration and refusal to ever give the Trump administration a win, the shocking new audio of Kilmar Abrego Garcia’s wife describing his abuse towards her, the left and legacy media ignoring the story and continuing to make Abrego Garcia their poster child in their fight with Trump, and more. Then Jason Riley, author of "The Affirmative Action Myth," joins to discuss the harms of affirmative action, why it hurts black students at elite universities more than helps them, the statistics that prove why these students would be better off academically at other great schools, how elite universities will be fighting Trump's anti-DEI efforts and the Supreme Court ruling, and more.

# Met Gala Goes Racial, False Trump NBC Narrative, Affirmative Action Myth, w/ Klavan and Jason Riley
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 05, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Monday. And guess what? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm not kidding you. It is National Astronaut Day. You can't make it up. It just happens to be [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5.76s)]
*  National Astronaut Day. Gail King, I salute you. I've been and I admire your sacrifice. You too, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=12.8s)]
*  Lauren Sanchez. I'm laughing so hard. Maureen and Sarah and I were texting about it yesterday. Like, [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=19.76s)]
*  you've got to be kidding me. It just happens to fall right after we do our big astronaut special. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=26.08s)]
*  Well, if you missed it, you should check it out on YouTube where it's blowing up. It's in our feed [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=32.08s)]
*  right now. In any event, here we are on our way toward our historic flight. And by the way, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=36.72s)]
*  looking it up on the nationaldaycalendar.com, it says that National Astronaut Day on May 5, [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=42.48s)]
*  1961, astronaut Alan Bartlett. Oh, I lost it just as I'm trying to click on it. Shepard, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=50.4s)]
*  it's about Alan Shepard, first became the first American in space aboard the Freedom 7 space [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=56.96s)]
*  capsule. That was literally the flight to which Gail King compared her vanity. Look, here we are, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=63.28s)]
*  astronauts with our in-depth training, getting ready for our historic flight that we also took. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=69.12s)]
*  So it's Maureen and Sarah, I salute you too, because we also sacrificed for our country. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=74.16s)]
*  And to all those of you who wrote in appreciating our sacrifice and our trailblazing, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=79.36s)]
*  people wrote in about how they never realized that because they drive their kids to school [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=84.48s)]
*  every morning, they too should be in the Indy 500. See, you get it. You get it. I salute you as well [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=88.64s)]
*  for your sacrifices and your expertise. Okay, moving on to other news. President Trump making [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=95.03999999999999s)]
*  news yesterday sparring with Meet the Press host, Kristen Welker, while Jen Psaki gets very offended [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=101.44s)]
*  when asked if she was part of the Biden cognitive decline coverup. She never saw anything, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=108.64s)]
*  anything like we all saw. I see nothing at the June debate. It wasn't until then. Sure, Jen. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=114.08s)]
*  Plus the Met Gala is tonight and it's apparently going to be the most politically charged one in [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=120.8s)]
*  years and the most pandering. We've got the perfect guest to discuss it all, Andrew Clavin, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=127.76s)]
*  host of The Daily Wire's Andrew Clavin Show and author of the new book, The Kingdom of Kane, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=132.96s)]
*  Finding God in the Literature of Darkness. It's out tomorrow. That's one of the many reasons he's [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=138.48s)]
*  the perfect person to start with the Met Gala on. It's all about finding God in the midst of evil [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=145.6s)]
*  and today's declining culture. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on YouTube and [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=152.32s)]

*  Take it. They have been embarrassed by the year after year after year press coverage [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=305.36s)]
*  of how disgustingly excessive and over the top. This showing of wealth is where the plates go for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=312.72s)]
*  over $70,000 a ticket. And you've got morons literally like the Kardashians and Diddy [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=319.12s)]
*  um, inside the Met Gala. I witnessed with my own eyes, dry humping in the bathrooms, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=327.44s)]
*  smoking in the Met Gala bathrooms with cigarettes. Another very famous pair from Wall Street, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=336.48s)]
*  snorting Coke, which my husband Doug saw with his own eyes in the men's room and making a mockery [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=343.36s)]
*  of this place, which is supposed to house some of our greatest works of art. So now they've decided [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=350.71999999999997s)]
*  to try to get over this reputation of Anna Wintour being America's biggest snob and this [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=355.6s)]
*  thing being the most over the top elitist evil event by pandering to blacks. What do you make of [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=362.24s)]
*  it? Well, first of all, I do want to say Megan first, thanks for having me on. But also I do [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=369.36s)]
*  want to say that you have picked the person who may care about the Met Gala least in America. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=374.08000000000004s)]
*  I think there may be people who can't, maybe who can't see possibly who care about it less, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=378.8s)]
*  but this is why you're perfect for it. I just why I'm perfect for it. I know. And I thought it was [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=383.92s)]
*  kind of hilarious that they were going to highlight black fashion. I'm not even sure what black [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=388.88s)]
*  fashion is to be honest with you. I would have liked it if they have highlighted white fashion. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=394.64000000000004s)]
*  It would have been at least a little different. It's really fascinating to watch a failed elite [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=399.68s)]
*  who has now been rejected by the American public in the last election, basically declared irrelevant [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  fighting very hard to remain at the top by doing the same things they've been doing for the last [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=411.76s)]
*  30 years. It's so out of date. It's so old fashioned and it's so untoward for this absolute display of [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=419.03999999999996s)]
*  pure privilege and wealth to condescend to recognize that some people who wear clothing [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=427.2s)]
*  happen to be black. And when you talk about the Met, it is it is a world class museum. It was one [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=433.36s)]
*  of the greatest museums in the world. And to have these people parading through and displaying [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=438.8s)]
*  as really a fashion accessory, they're caring for minorities, they're caring for the poor, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=445.36s)]
*  they're caring for whatever they're pretending to be caring about when instead they could just be [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=451.84000000000003s)]
*  showing off the fact that they have enough money to be beautiful. And I think most of us would like [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=456.16s)]
*  to see that most of us like to see beautiful people being beautiful. Why we have to see beautiful [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=460.32s)]
*  people being virtuous is just escapes me entirely. I think it really is fascinating [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=464.48s)]
*  that the people who just were rebuked by the American public in a very big way [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=471.04s)]
*  are clinging to what they've been doing all this time. There's absolutely no taking stock, [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=477.28000000000003s)]
*  absolutely no looking in the mirror, no thinking, you know, maybe we did overdo it, maybe we've gone [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=483.44s)]
*  down the wrong path. Maybe we are wrong. They can't do any of that because their entire power [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=488.56s)]
*  structure is built on exactly this on displays of virtue. And I think that it's kind of, I would [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=493.12s)]
*  find it sad if I didn't find it so hilarious to watch them kind of slowly, slowly swirling down [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=499.12s)]
*  the drain. I think they're going exactly where they should go. And I think it's going to continue [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=503.52s)]
*  because I mean, people are sick of it. You know, I've always wanted to write an article that I've [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=508.56s)]
*  never gotten around to called Netflix made me a bigot by sequestering black work on like a black [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=513.36s)]
*  lives matter. Like a year. Every time you turn on Netflix, all you'd get is like black directors, [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=521.28s)]
*  black actors, black film. But it's like, oh my god, like what happened? And I would sit there and [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=527.1999999999999s)]
*  go, I'm not going to watch this. I'm not going to click on this and encourage them. And then I'd [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=532.16s)]
*  noticed, of course, that some of my favorite actors, you know, Denzel Washington was shuttled into [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=535.76s)]
*  that place. It is like when you go to a bookstore and try to find a copy of an American classic [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=540.3199999999999s)]
*  and visual man written by a black guy, and it's in black literature, it is the most alienating, [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=545.44s)]
*  divisive, bigoted thing you could possibly do. And they do it again and again and again. And it [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=551.7600000000001s)]
*  just shows that they don't know any of the people who are being excluded by it, the actual black [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=557.44s)]
*  people who are being excluded by it. And your description, your description of what's going on [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=562.08s)]
*  in the men's and let these room, which I had no idea. I witnessed it. It sounds more interesting [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=566.8800000000001s)]
*  than the show itself. I'm sorry. But it's like, but the disgusting debauchery truly of like [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=573.04s)]
*  you're in have some respect you absolute cultural lowlifes. You got in here because Anna Wintour [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=578.48s)]
*  thought somebody might click to see your half naked body on her red carpet, but have some respect for [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=585.12s)]
*  the actual great works of art that are in this place. You don't understand true beauty and true [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=590.16s)]
*  culture. Like they only understand it through their Kardashian lens. It's absolutely disgusting. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=595.1999999999999s)]
*  Here's the thing. Here's what they're saying about tonight's gala. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=600.8s)]
*  Okay, they're calling it super fine tailoring black style, which the museum says is a cultural [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=605.04s)]
*  and historical examination of black style over 300 years through the concept of dandyism. The [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=611.28s)]
*  Met Show tonight for the first time is entirely devoted to designers of color. As the New York [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=619.12s)]
*  Times puts it focuses on the way black men have used fashion as a tool, a self actualization, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=623.44s)]
*  revolution and subversion throughout American history and the black diaspora. According to the [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=629.6s)]
*  Met's website, the exhibition is sponsored by Louis Vuitton, Instagram and some others, [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=636.32s)]
*  including Conde Nast, Anna Wintour's owner, the owner of Vogue, not her owner, the owner of her [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=640.4000000000001s)]
*  magazine. The New York Times says the show the culmination of five years of work by Andrew [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=646.1600000000001s)]
*  Bolton, the Costume Institute's curator in charge to diversify the department's holdings. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=650.72s)]
*  He's white, by the way, so is Anna. That's why they had to have their first ever host committee [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=655.6800000000001s)]
*  since 2019 at least, including many black people like Simone Biles, Spike Lee, Tanya Lewis Lee, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=661.6s)]
*  Janelle Monáe, Angel Reese, as I mentioned, and Usher. And then the co-chairs of the gala are ASAP [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=671.6s)]
*  Rocky, Formula One driver Lewis Hamilton and Pharrell Williams. The honorary chair is, of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=679.68s)]
*  course, LeBron James, who we all look to as a fashion icon. This is to your point about like, [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=685.4399999999999s)]
*  not like taking some of our great authors and putting them into the black author section. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=691.92s)]
*  I was at an event one time and the interviewer, she didn't mean to do me any disrespect, [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=698.2399999999999s)]
*  but she was talking about my success in the cable news world. And she said, [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=703.6s)]
*  you were one of the highest paid women in all of journalism. And I said, you don't have to say [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=709.84s)]
*  woman. And it was true. I wasn't trying to toot my own horn on my salary, but it diminished it. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=716.96s)]
*  When I was at the peak of cable, no, there were actually maybe two people in the industry making [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=724.96s)]
*  more than me. And they were men. But the point is simply don't separate me out based on my lady [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=730.56s)]
*  parts. It diminishes me. And my whole goal is to get to the top period, not just top of the people [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=736.64s)]
*  who have vaginas. That is not what I want. And I'm going to guess that my black counterparts in [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=743.76s)]
*  fashion would really not like to have that same asterisks behind their designs or be padded on the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=750.7199999999999s)]
*  head like a pet by Anna Wintour. Yeah. The first the first female to do something is in fact an [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=757.84s)]
*  insult in its in its way. But isn't that kind of the point? Every movement, every movement in America [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=764.88s)]
*  gets taken over by the left. This is one of the things I blame the right for that we have no [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=770.32s)]
*  cultural acuity. We have no culture. We're not nimble in the culture like the left is. So, you [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=774.72s)]
*  know, feminism raises raise some really interesting issues, really important issues. But now it's just [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=779.9200000000001s)]
*  leftism in a skirt. You know, the idea that people shouldn't be racist, great idea. But now even that [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=785.04s)]
*  is simply racism, you know, is simply socialism with a black face. Everything they do simply [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=791.28s)]
*  becomes leftism in disguise. And so the division is actually the point, the idea that your identity, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=796.64s)]
*  you know, you have to you have to congratulate them on this, because the left, who could say, [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=803.68s)]
*  who could have predicted that the left would be able to make the love between men and women [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=809.12s)]
*  problematical? I mean more problematical than it just naturally is. I mean we all obviously, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=813.36s)]
*  sex and romance are places where we all have problems. But they've actually made it unappealing. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=818.8000000000001s)]
*  People have stopped having babies. People don't get married in time to have babies. People have [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=824.16s)]
*  to, you know, write these long things before they can just say, I would like a guy in my life, or I [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=828.64s)]
*  would like a girl in my life, you know, to to be different than me and to have a build a family [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=832.8000000000001s)]
*  with and all that. They've made all of that problematical and as a result, the human race [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=838.24s)]
*  is actually dying out. So congratulations to the left. But all of this stuff is the point. All of [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=842.8s)]
*  this stuff is the point. The point is never, you know, hey, let's be colorblind so that we all treat [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=848.0s)]
*  each other equally. I think we'd all sign on to that. The point is not like, you know, let judge [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=852.5600000000001s)]
*  people on their abilities and their talents and not on their sex or their race or anything. We'd [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=857.6s)]
*  all sign on to that. But it's always it always turns into the most divisive possible thing. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=863.36s)]
*  So you start out saying, you know, can we tolerate gay people? Absolutely. Let's tolerate gay people. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=870.4s)]
*  It ends up saying, you know, we have to teach your children, we have to show your children [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=876.32s)]
*  homosexual porn. It's always pushed to the absolute level of social dissolution because I think the [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=880.72s)]
*  social dissolution is the point in museums all around the West, Megan, all around the West. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=886.32s)]
*  There are attacks on the very Western culture that made those museums possible. This is happening [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=891.92s)]
*  everywhere. You can walk into almost any museum and you will see something about white privilege [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=897.04s)]
*  or, you know, Western colonialism instead of look at this beauty this culture has produced. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=902.3199999999999s)]
*  So the culture throughout the West has been polluted by this stuff. And it's one thing to [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=908.0s)]
*  attack it, which I love doing. And I think we should attack it endlessly. But I also think [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=913.36s)]
*  people of traditional beliefs, people of Christian religious beliefs, people of patriotic beliefs [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=918.32s)]
*  also have to start making culture. You know, we have to start making something that looks beautiful [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=925.12s)]
*  so that people say, oh, I get it. This is actually better than what these be better than a banana [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=929.6800000000001s)]
*  taped to the wall. So let me let me give you another twist on this. You're the perfect person [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=934.4s)]
*  to be discussing this with. I mean, truly, like that the whole notion of your book, The Kingdom [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=939.44s)]
*  of Cain, meant to find God in the midst of evil is what we kind of try to do every day on this [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=944.0s)]
*  show and on yours, too. I've heard you. And we are surrounded by truly evil events. And I do believe, [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=950.32s)]
*  I know I don't mean to sound too dramatic, but I think the Met Gala is one of them. I really do. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=957.68s)]
*  I think the excesses of people like Sanchez and Bezos are among them. I feel like it crosses over [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=961.84s)]
*  to genuinely evil in a world where people are hurting, where people are struggling, [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=969.76s)]
*  where people have real concerns to be bragging about traveling with not just your super yacht, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=974.4s)]
*  but its sister, which just boards your helicopter. And by the way, it's not just them. There's an [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=980.24s)]
*  article about Mark Zuckerberg today talking about how he went over to the fjords in Norway, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=985.52s)]
*  and they have anti helicopter rules there because there's these majestic mountains, [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=992.0s)]
*  inside of which are these skinny, beautiful, cold fjords, which are melted glaciers from years ago. [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  And you're not allowed to have a helicopter there to preserve the beauty, and they don't want them [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1003.4399999999999s)]
*  landing, and they don't want to turn this into LaGuardia Airport. And so what did he do? He [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1007.6s)]
*  brought his yacht and its little sister where it has a helipad. And Bezos has the same thing. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1011.12s)]
*  I've seen it. I haven't been on it, but I've seen it. Where you can get around the anti helicopter [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1017.28s)]
*  rule because they don't want you landing on one of the mountains by having it land on the sister [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1022.96s)]
*  yacht. And then he goes heliskiing in the peaks of the fjords. So it's him. It's supposed to be [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1027.92s)]
*  like some hundred million dollar wedding between Bezos and Sanchez in June in Italy, some over the [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1036.08s)]
*  top situation where the amounts of money that are going to be flushed down the toilet. So these two [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1043.1200000000001s)]
*  vain empty vessels can see themselves in People magazine is stomach turning and the Met Gala. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1051.44s)]
*  Okay. So Anna Wintour and her excesses and her obsession with fashion and over the top, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1059.12s)]
*  parties like this where she's surrounded only by the right names is part of the problem. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1064.8799999999999s)]
*  So she, to get the cover, does something about black people. To get the extra cover, [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1069.36s)]
*  she has the advisory committee of black people. And then there's this quote in the Times, [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1074.48s)]
*  um, one of the advisors, Ms. Kareefa Johnson, in, in talking about what she hopes to see tonight [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1080.24s)]
*  and what she doesn't want to see, put it more dryly quote, I just really don't want to see [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1086.56s)]
*  any floor length do rags or pimp canes. She said, now I wasn't sure what the do rag it's spelled [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1092.3999999999999s)]
*  D U R A G was because in my head that connotes the thing that, you know, some people wear on [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1099.52s)]
*  their heads and indeed that's what it is. That is it's a do rag. Like, like it almost looks like [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1103.28s)]
*  a bathing cap with like a tie at the back, almost like a pirate's cap. And some people of color [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1107.28s)]
*  wear them. And she's saying, you better not go like pimp with it where it's, you know, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1111.76s)]
*  goes all the way down to the floor. You have a pimp cane. So fuck you. If you want to go that way [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1116.72s)]
*  with black fashion. And to me, Andrew, like we have Jason Riley coming on second hour [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1121.2s)]
*  and he, he wrote the book, please stop helping us. And he's got a follow up out today about [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1126.16s)]
*  affirmative action saying, you know, black people and their ascent in the country was going very [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1130.8s)]
*  well. It was an. Astronomic curve upward prior to the great society in terms of everything, [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1136.8s)]
*  socioeconomic measures, education, religious attendance, intact families. It wasn't until [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1142.8799999999999s)]
*  the government, meaning the left in particular, Lyndon Johnson got involved that things really [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1148.3999999999999s)]
*  started to spiral downward. So you don't want to see the do rags and the pimp canes, but I guarantee [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1154.56s)]
*  this woman's a leftist who helped create more of a culture in some sections of the black community [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1160.64s)]
*  that embraced that kind of fashion that she's now embarrassed about. Whereas the, if the left had [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1166.8000000000002s)]
*  left the black community alone, they probably have total equal parity on all these measures that they [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1173.2800000000002s)]
*  like to now raise as signs that Republicanism has failed and America has failed. [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1179.6000000000001s)]
*  Right. Well, this is what, you know, and Jason is a great, really knows this topic. Well, [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1185.8400000000001s)]
*  it's absolutely true. You left out when you were talking about the excesses of wealth, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1189.52s)]
*  you left out the interview that Michelle Obama just gave where she was complaining that when she [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1193.1200000000001s)]
*  was in the white house, she had to pay for food. And, and I thought like this is, this is indicative. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1197.2s)]
*  You know, it's funny, America is a country where people don't care if you get rich. They like it. [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1203.1200000000001s)]
*  If you get rich, you know, I lived in Britain for a long time where if you get rich, they cut you [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1206.96s)]
*  down immediately. If you're a success, they cut you down. That's not true in America. In America, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1210.56s)]
*  we congratulate people for their success. Nobody cares that Jeff Bezos is a billionaire. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1214.56s)]
*  All we ask is that you behave with a little bit of elegance and a little bit of compassion for [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1219.28s)]
*  people who aren't billionaires. And that seems to be too much for them to do. This is exactly what [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1223.44s)]
*  we're looking at, Megan. We are looking at the alienation of the upper classes from the rest of [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1228.3999999999999s)]
*  us. They don't care if we are, if our factories close, they don't care if our towns die. They [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1234.8s)]
*  don't care if globalism has destroyed not just the manufacturing base, but the soul of the country. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1240.16s)]
*  They don't care that people are dying by deaths of despair at such numbers that our life expectancy [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1246.0s)]
*  has gone down. They don't care that babies aren't being produced. They've got theirs. And you know, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1252.0800000000002s)]
*  it is interesting in a country as generous as ours, where we're like, you know, good for you, [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1257.3600000000001s)]
*  Jeff Bezos, Amazon, a great idea. And nobody loves Amazon more than I do. Just treat people [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1261.44s)]
*  with a little bit of respect and look around yourself and make sure that other people aren't [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1266.5600000000002s)]
*  being crushed beneath your heels. And I think, you know, it's funny, recently with the rise of [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1272.0800000000002s)]
*  Donald Trump, guys like Bezos seem to have caught on a little bit, which I think is a great thing. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1277.3600000000001s)]
*  Zuckerberg seemed to catch on a little bit, but somehow- [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1282.72s)]
*  Andrew, Jeff Bezos literally two weeks ago shot his fiance and Gale King into space and then [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1285.44s)]
*  lectured everybody. Have you been? It costs a million dollars a seat. No, no one has been. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1292.56s)]
*  And no one's going to be going. I'm saving up. I'm saving up. I know. [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1298.24s)]
*  He has lost touch. It is amazing how out of touch they are. But it's also amazing. What's also [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1302.08s)]
*  amazing is the fact that they are actually being exiled at this moment. As we speak, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1309.76s)]
*  they are being, the elites are clinging to power. They're not clinging to money. They've got plenty [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1315.12s)]
*  of money, but they're clinging to power because the social power, the cultural power that they had [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1320.16s)]
*  is gone. When was the last time you went to a movie that really mattered? When was the last [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1324.8000000000002s)]
*  time you saw anything on TV that you actually cared about? Their cultural sensibility has gotten [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1328.64s)]
*  so far away from what people want, what people care about. You know, the Met Gala, people would [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1334.24s)]
*  watch the Met Gala. Pretty people showed up in pretty clothes, kept their mouths shut and [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1340.0s)]
*  displayed themselves. I think that's something people like to watch. We all like to watch that. [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1344.4s)]
*  We could accept it on those terms. Yes. We all like to see pretty actresses and handsome actors [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1348.72s)]
*  dress up and show up for their awards and all this stuff. But when they show up for their awards and [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1353.1200000000001s)]
*  they shake their fingers at us and tell us we're voting for the wrong people, not understanding [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1356.96s)]
*  that maybe the price of eggs has hobbled other people in a way that they don't understand, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1361.28s)]
*  that's when you start to lose touch. That's when you start to lose touch and you start to lose your [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1368.08s)]
*  cultural power. This is the moment. What's frustrating for me is this is the moment when [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1371.76s)]
*  people who have insight into what is going on culturally might be creating things instead of [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1377.04s)]
*  just attacking what the left is doing. I think this is the time when it would be nice to have [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1383.44s)]
*  somebody buy a studio that would actually produce good quality material for the rest of the country. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1388.8s)]
*  You know, they're making movies that only like six or seven people go to see and then they [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  give them Oscars. It's like 60 minutes being nominated for an Emmy for butchering an interview [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1401.04s)]
*  so that it looked anti-Trump, it looked like Trump's opponent was doing better than she was [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1406.96s)]
*  and now they're nominated for an Emmy for that dishonesty. It's like the New York Times winning [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1412.24s)]
*  Pulitzer Prizes for covering a Russian collusion story that literally did not exist, that was not [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1416.4s)]
*  a real story. And so they're basically celebrating themselves and elevating themselves and parading [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1422.88s)]
*  themselves but they're parading themselves to fewer and fewer people and many, many more people [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1428.24s)]
*  are catching on to the fact that maybe winning a Pulitzer isn't that important if you're [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1432.72s)]
*  giving it to people for lying. You know, maybe winning an Emmy isn't that important if you're [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1436.8s)]
*  giving it to people for butchering the news. So it is a moment, it's a moment of incredible [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1440.3999999999999s)]
*  self-blindness, you know, it's like they think we don't see them or they think that somehow they [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1445.28s)]
*  can hold on for another generation. I don't think they can but this is the moment when people have [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1450.32s)]
*  to start creating things on the right, whatever you want to call the right, conservatives, you know, [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1456.0s)]
*  liberals I think are on the right at this point. Whatever that mindset is that says our [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1461.68s)]
*  traditions matter, our freedom matters, that nobody has all the answers, that nobody should [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1466.48s)]
*  be so self-certain that they understand things, so self-certain that they're willing to silence [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1471.44s)]
*  and censor other people, that Marco Rubio won't have to go into the State Department and clear [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1476.64s)]
*  out their censorship bureau, you know, I mean that's the kind of thing that I think we got to get rid [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1481.44s)]
*  of and we have to do it by making a culture that works. I'm thrilled, you know, I noticed in that [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1486.0s)]
*  New York Times article about the Met Gala they said, they cited the fact in their words that [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1490.64s)]
*  Donald Trump had seized power at the Kennedy Center. Well I'm thrilled for Donald Trump to [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1497.0400000000002s)]
*  kick those people out of the Kennedy Center. The Kennedy Center is a national theater and should [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1502.88s)]
*  not be displaying drag queens for kids, that's not what they're there for, they're there to display [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1507.1200000000001s)]
*  the best artistic work that this country can produce but I want to see them start to produce [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1512.0s)]
*  great artistic work at the Kennedy Center. I don't want to see them die, I'm not looking for [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1516.96s)]
*  revenge, I'm looking for a reform. This is the moment, this is one of the most exciting moments [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1520.48s)]
*  of my lifetime culturally and politically because this shift is happening and I hope we take [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1526.48s)]
*  advantage of it, I think it's a beautiful thing. That thing that you're seeing at the Met Gala, [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1531.76s)]
*  it looks like Rome just before it collapsed, you know. Yes, 100 percent, that's exactly right, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1536.08s)]
*  it feels like end of days kind of stuff and just two points, the Times points out that [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1541.92s)]
*  given the crackdown on DEI by the Trump administration and all of corporate America [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1548.0s)]
*  and many colleges, I mean even colleges now, we'll get into this with Jason later, but even [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1552.64s)]
*  University of Michigan got rid of its DEI program which was, it was the worst, the worst, so it's [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1557.76s)]
*  not just the ones Trump is threatening, you know, many others are like, let's get rid of this, [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1562.5600000000002s)]
*  this has been a nightmare. So this looks like the resistance now, Anna Wintour, [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1566.72s)]
*  Anna Wintour and her $70,000 plate gala is the resistance now because they're leaning into [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1571.84s)]
*  the ridiculous hyper focus on race in the midst of the country's pushback on this nonsense and [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1580.8s)]
*  then they also point out that in the past, further complications in the fact that she's hosting this [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1587.68s)]
*  are the fact that in the past she faced her own allegations of creating a racially insensitive [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1594.88s)]
*  workplace at Vogue and also despite the many DEI initiatives after 2020, the fashion world [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1598.88s)]
*  has seemingly failed to make good on those promises of the more than 15 appointments at [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1605.92s)]
*  the top of major brands this year, not a single one was a designer of color which is totally fine [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1610.0800000000002s)]
*  to point out because live by the sword, die by the sword, maybe they couldn't find black designers [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1616.5600000000002s)]
*  who for whatever reason rose to the top, maybe next year they will, maybe there weren't enough [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1622.72s)]
*  Asians either, I have no idea, maybe it used to be a meritocracy and only now are they getting [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1626.64s)]
*  obsessed with race, but the point is if you're going to live by that sword and Anna Wintour does [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1631.2s)]
*  now, then you're going to die by it too and this is her trying to stop herself from dying by it [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1636.48s)]
*  by being like, but I did a thing promoting black fashion, look at me, I'm a good person, I had [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1641.04s)]
*  Simone Biles. Okay, secondly, to your point about what was the last time you saw just like a pure [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1646.96s)]
*  movie that was like just about American values made you feel good, it happened to be last night, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1652.64s)]
*  now not coincidentally, it was from a film that was made 15 years ago, but let me tell you what [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1657.92s)]
*  happened, we didn't get to watch the Kentucky Derby on Saturday, we were all over the place, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1663.0400000000002s)]
*  my family and so we, I knew who won because I am in the news, right, so I saw who won, but I asked [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1669.0400000000002s)]
*  the family, has anybody seen, nobody had seen it, so I said, all right, close your eyes, we're going [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1676.64s)]
*  to watch the Kentucky Derby on Sunday night, I'll queue it up on YouTube and that's what we did, [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1680.48s)]
*  we watched some local pre-show from Kentucky for half an hour and then we played the race, [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1684.8s)]
*  which was two minutes and we wear our little, I have a little Kentucky Derby box and we put [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1689.28s)]
*  on fascinators and we put on fun hats and like little scarves and ascot tie type things for the [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1693.04s)]
*  guys, my sons, it was fun, anyway, we watched it and as you know, sovereignty triumphed over [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1699.52s)]
*  journalism and there's a lot to say there too, but it got us in the horse watching mood, so we put on [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1707.04s)]
*  that great film from 2010 from Disney Secretariat starring Diane Lane, it was great and John [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1714.48s)]
*  Malkovich as the horse's trainer, it was so good, it was made by the same producers, the same [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1724.32s)]
*  producing team that made the movie Miracle on Ice and that did Invincible, which is a great film [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1730.3999999999999s)]
*  with Mark Wahlberg, you know, Disney used to know how to make films that were great for the whole [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1736.08s)]
*  family that had wholesome lessons that made you feel good about the country and the possibilities [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1743.12s)]
*  here, by the way, I later learned that Secretariat was the only non-human included on ESPN's [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1749.6799999999998s)]
*  roster of the 100 greatest athletes of the 20th century, so or maybe it's top 50, I think it might [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1756.1599999999999s)]
*  have been top 50 and Secretariat was the only horse or even just non-human listed on that [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1761.52s)]
*  because he was just so what an incredibly talented horse, the greatest race horse to ever live and [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1766.6399999999999s)]
*  anyway, it's one of those things not unlike Miracle with Kurt Russell where they take you back to the [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1771.36s)]
*  Miracle on Ice 1980 and the US hockey team and just make you feel good about the country and [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1778.0s)]
*  something extraordinary that happened here, but look what a difference, you don't have to go back [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1781.76s)]
*  before 2025, go to 2020, in 10 years Disney collapsed on its mission, its understanding [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1786.3999999999999s)]
*  of what America wanted and it's become evil, yes, I will use that word too for them, they crossed [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  over into trying to trans our children, it was so recently, Andrew, that they were still part of the [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1801.12s)]
*  good guys. Yeah, well one of the things about intellectual dishonesty is that it goes along [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1807.12s)]
*  and it goes along and then it falls off the table, this is true in individual life and it's true of [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1812.16s)]
*  corporate life as well and I think that in the last five years we have seen the arts in America [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1816.4s)]
*  die and that's not to say that no one has produced any good work, it's to say that as I said before [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1821.6000000000001s)]
*  there's very few movies that we all get together and watch and talk about, very few television [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1826.96s)]
*  shows that really catch fire and all the ones that do have all been about bad people, they've all been [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1831.1200000000001s)]
*  about anti-heroes when they do work because they no longer know how to make stories about men and [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1836.0800000000002s)]
*  women who are decent people and are looking for love and looking for the things that ordinary people [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1840.24s)]
*  are looking for. You know all my life I have loved stories, my life has been about writing stories, [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1844.88s)]
*  I have read every novel on earth of you know this ever of any quality whatsoever, I've seen every [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1850.24s)]
*  movie in the world and I never cared who the people were in the story, I was happy to see a story, [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1856.24s)]
*  I'm an American, you know Americans look like all kinds of things, I was happy to see a story [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1862.08s)]
*  about Italians, I was happy to see a story about Irish people, Jews, black people, it never ever [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1865.92s)]
*  mattered to me whatsoever, I never even thought about the fact that that's what I was watching, [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1870.72s)]
*  I thought I was watching stories of good and evil, stories of hope and triumph, stories of failure [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1874.3200000000002s)]
*  and despair, all the things we want to tell stories about. Suddenly I'm being told and this is [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1878.48s)]
*  something that's happened, I mean I've had numerous people, friends in Hollywood who have basically [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1884.0800000000002s)]
*  lost their jobs or have left the business altogether because a white man can no longer get hired, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1889.44s)]
*  it's very hard for white men to start a career publishing novels right now because everybody [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1895.28s)]
*  has to have it not just be black but has to have a name that sounds black or at least sounds [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1901.44s)]
*  colored in some way and this is deeply offensive because after years of reading books like To Kill [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1905.68s)]
*  a Mockingbird where we learned that bigotry was wrong, we're suddenly being told no no that was [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1913.76s)]
*  just the wrong bigotry, once you get the bigotry right, once you get that once you're hating the [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1918.8s)]
*  right people then the hatred is great, then the hatred is absolutely terrific and they've turned [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1922.88s)]
*  the values on their heads and I always tell people like the devil doesn't care who gets hated as long [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1928.0s)]
*  as the hating gets done and so what you have is an art form storytelling that has been completely [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1933.2800000000002s)]

*  the only place where you can see visual art that really matters is in video games and even those [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1946.0800000000002s)]
*  are under attack by the woke ideologues. Ideology is death to art, you know the other day and this [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1951.6s)]
*  is kind of on what's happening now I watched that film Conclave which is about a you know getting [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1958.08s)]
*  a new pope, well yeah you said absolutely right but it starts out with the good guy in it you know [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1963.9199999999998s)]
*  played by Ray Fiennes making a speech saying certainty is a danger, I completely agree I [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1968.8799999999999s)]
*  think that certainty is one of the big dangers we have, we should all be a little humble, a little [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1974.32s)]
*  bit uncertain about we believe, a little willing to listen to other people, the rest of the movie [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1978.8s)]
*  is all filled with religious certainty about everything but religion, it's filled with religious [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1984.56s)]
*  certainty about what the church should do about gays, what it should do about marriage, what it [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1988.72s)]
*  should do about all the about women, it's filled with absolutely intense religious certainty about [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1992.72s)]
*  everything except religion, that is where I think the left and the arts which the left control in [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=1998.8s)]
*  this country and in the west in general that is where they have come across or they have become [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2004.72s)]
*  so certain, they become so religious in the bad sense of that term and they've lost all humility [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2009.04s)]
*  and they don't know how to tell a story anymore and it's like listen I'm not looking to go backwards, [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2014.72s)]
*  I want to see new stuff, I want to see 3D stuff, I want to see all the new kinds of things but [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2019.04s)]
*  certain things stay the same, human nature stays the same, human values stay the same, beauty stays [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2024.32s)]
*  the same and I think that those are the things that have been absolutely rejected because they've [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2029.1200000000001s)]
*  rejected all the values of the west and those are some of the central values of the west. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2033.52s)]
*  It's been a really dispiriting time for people like me who love the arts, I mean I have always [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2038.56s)]
*  loved as the poet John Keats said I have loved the principle of beauty in all things and it's a very [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2045.44s)]
*  dispiriting time to watch for five years where you can't see anything but a lecture on how all of the [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2051.2s)]
*  things that you have found beautiful and good and true including God and country and family, [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2057.68s)]
*  all of those things were really just terribly, terribly oppressive to some people who have been [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2064.0s)]
*  invented to be oppressed and I think that it's incredible how empty the stories that we've seen [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  have been and so when you say you went back to Secretariat as you said that movie which was a [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2077.3599999999997s)]
*  good movie that movie is not that long ago and even now you see small little flickers of [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2081.52s)]
*  remembrance of things that matter. I saw a movie by Stephen Soderbergh called Black Bag which was [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2088.24s)]
*  very clever and glamorous and sophisticated but it was about marriage, it was about the holiness [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2093.2s)]
*  and sacredness of marriage, it's built into this spy story and you think like yeah people can still [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2098.48s)]
*  do this but they have to be brave enough to do it and they have in Hollywood now you have to fight [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2103.84s)]
*  the unions who watch every story to be about some you know neglected person or neglected [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2107.76s)]
*  or you wind up like the movie Reagan where you can't get nominated for best picture [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2114.48s)]
*  because you didn't have enough LGBTQs on your production set or people of color or indigenous [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2118.32s)]
*  whatever I mean go down the list but you have to have these quotas filled in order to even [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2123.5200000000004s)]
*  qualify for the big awards in Hollywood so it's just the whole thing is such a farce it's it's [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2127.1200000000003s)]
*  it makes no sense the you mentioned something at the top about how it's like hard to find a nice [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2131.92s)]
*  movie about a male female relationship now you're just like a beautiful you know heterosexual [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2138.48s)]
*  falling in love coming of age story and I want to add to that because not only is it hard to find [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2144.6400000000003s)]
*  that but like pornographic stuff is ubiquitous now you know teens like they say the average 12 [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2151.92s)]
*  year old has already seen triple x porn on one of his devices by the time he's 12 and then you [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2161.2000000000003s)]
*  think about and this is no offense but I saw this headline to my pals over the trigonometry podcast [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2170.48s)]
*  and I like these guys but I saw online a lot of the women who I follow who are strong women [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2176.56s)]
*  were very angry with them because and saying I'm unfollowing the show because they're interviewing [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2182.64s)]
*  that woman from OnlyFans who had sex with a hundred guys in a day in 24 hours and you know put it [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2188.64s)]
*  online and then she's just all about these crazy very depressing antics that she does sexually and [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2196.64s)]
*  I see like I'm not about deplatforming and I still like those guys at trigonometry but that is [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2205.04s)]
*  definitely not an interview I would do I would not want to highlight this woman's role in our [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2210.24s)]
*  society I think it's something we should be feeling really sad and depressed about not not giving [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2215.12s)]
*  greater you know prominence to or light to but can you speak to that because that's all part of it [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2220.24s)]
*  speaking of evil well I think it's really interesting to me that the Biden administration [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2225.92s)]
*  which targeted Catholics who wanted to go to the Latin mass for investigation feel that it's against [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2232.24s)]
*  the first amendment to silence porn porn is is toxic it's poison I don't actually want to outlaw [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2238.3999999999996s)]
*  it I mean I'd like to outlaw it I'm not sure I can see a way to outlaw it without destroying [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2244.3999999999996s)]
*  people's freedoms and giving the government too much power but but it's a toxic it's toxic and [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2248.9599999999996s)]
*  it's toxic for a really simple reason is it strips the most one of the most important interior things [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2254.24s)]
*  we do which is making love to one another of everything but the body outlines that come [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2260.4s)]
*  together and so it empties out the experience boys who get addicted to porn never develop [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2264.88s)]
*  sexually they can't have sex in real life they can't relate to actual women and and this is [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2269.84s)]
*  part of and you and I've talked about this before Megan but it's probably to me one of the most [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2274.96s)]
*  important subjects there is this is part of a a genuine attempt to erase the category of female [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2279.36s)]
*  from the human experience I this idea that a guy puts on a dress and suddenly he's a girl [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2286.24s)]
*  it is it's it's deeply offensive not because I care what that guy does with his life it's because [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2291.92s)]
*  I care that the society recognizes that being a woman is a very particular experience and includes [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2297.2s)]
*  as as the center of that experience motherhood which is another thing has been that has been [[00:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2303.3599999999997s)]
*  denigrated to the point where women apologize when they say oh I'm just a mom I'm just a mom like you [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2307.44s)]
*  you're the center of the creative world you're the thing that artists imitate you're the thing [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2313.92s)]
*  that everybody builds the world to protect and yet you're not just a mom you're the center of the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2318.48s)]
*  world you know that that is that is actually what you are and and this is part of the reason that [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2324.4s)]
*  people don't have babies you know they've tried every single thing to get women to have babies [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2328.7200000000003s)]
*  let's give them five thousand dollars let's give them a maternity leave let's give them all these [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2333.28s)]
*  you can't do it because they're denigrated because they're attacked and porn is kind of [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2337.76s)]
*  the absolute expression of that denigration the being a woman in in the act of sex is different [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2342.72s)]
*  than being a man in the act of sex I shouldn't have to say that but I think I do it is an [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2349.3599999999997s)]
*  entirely different experience look having having a guy having sex with a hundred women in a day [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2353.4399999999996s)]
*  would also be disgusting and also be immoral but it's not quite the same thing as the self-immolation [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2359.04s)]
*  of a woman doing that basically erasing the whole purpose of herself and her body and her soul I [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2366.16s)]
*  would argue by this absolutely demonic display and I love the guys at Trigonometry too and I [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2372.4s)]
*  understand why they why they did it but still I think that really what you should have on if you [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2379.6800000000003s)]
*  want to talk about that subject what you should have one is a priest you know you should have one [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2384.8s)]
*  like an exorcist or something like that yeah because that that is a symbol of a truly broken [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2389.12s)]
*  society broken at its core and you know I this is a thing where Elon Musk and I are actually on the [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2395.12s)]
*  same page it is the death of humanity people stop having babies you know it's it's not just I don't [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2401.2s)]
*  think humanity will die out because people will start having babies but the places where people [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2406.56s)]
*  have stopped are the places where civilization is at its peak where modernity is at its furthest [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2410.3999999999996s)]
*  limit and I think that that says something about modernity and it says something about [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2416.08s)]
*  the society we've become there is a very very strong argument to be made and this is actually [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2420.96s)]
*  one of the arguments in my book there's a very strong argument to be made that our society in [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2427.04s)]
*  increasingly losing its faith and I'm not even going to define that faith just saying the faith [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2432.88s)]
*  in God that basically underpinned our society has gone insane that our society is a society of illness [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2438.24s)]
*  where people can no longer see the spiritual realities that are right in front of their faces [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2444.72s)]
*  we know that it was disgusting for that woman to sleep with 100 people but it's very hard to put [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2449.84s)]
*  into words without becoming spiritual without speaking spiritually it's very hard to say what [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2453.44s)]
*  what is wrong about it you know it's her choice why shouldn't she do it we don't understand why [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2458.16s)]
*  that's disgusting anymore we know for a fact that it's disgusting for a man in a dress to go into a [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2462.48s)]
*  girl's locker room in an undress there but we can't quite say why because we haven't got the [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2468.4s)]
*  spiritual diction to speak about it anymore we actually don't know who we are anymore we think [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2472.96s)]
*  you know the guys the guys who think they're smart who think they're cynical and tough and [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2479.2s)]
*  see into the heart of things talk as materialists but materialism is completely unsupportable when [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2483.3599999999997s)]
*  I say materialist I mean people who think that we're nothing but stuff that there's nothing to us [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2488.7999999999997s)]
*  there's no soul stuff in us it's just all physicality that's an indefensible position it's a position [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2493.2s)]
*  that can't be argued it's an unscientific position it's not a position that anybody who knows anything [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2499.2799999999997s)]

*  position of intellectuals and artists in our country and in our in in the west and I think [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2512.56s)]
*  it's driven us insane I think that there's a certain kind of insanity you know I compare it [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2518.0s)]
*  to that it's called the man in the gorilla suit test there was a famous test done I think in the [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2522.88s)]
*  90s where they gave people a picture of people passing around a basketball and they said count [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2527.7599999999998s)]

*  fact that a guy in a gorilla suit walked through the scene they just didn't see it because they [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2538.32s)]
*  weren't looking for it and I feel the same way about God I feel that we have been trained to [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2542.08s)]
*  look at ourselves as things we talk about morality as if it were a fiction smart people say this stuff [[00:42:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2546.08s)]
*  they say oh it's morality is just a fiction that we share there's no such thing as absolute good [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=2552.4s)]

*  they haven't been here for more than two years and trump has tried to expand it beyond just [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3224.24s)]
*  immediately at the southern border they get no due process they get none they get turned away [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3228.3999999999996s)]
*  and ejected immediately the only way they stop that is if they claim asylum now some people will [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3233.7599999999998s)]
*  do that but many won't and those people are not entitled to due process so he is right to wiggle [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3239.04s)]
*  on these sweeping demands that he just say all of these illegals get quote due process it's [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3244.48s)]
*  actually a lot more complicated than that and he's a hundred percent right to defer to his lawyers [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3250.4s)]
*  while saying i will follow what the supreme court tells me but you know the view isn't going to tell [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3255.84s)]
*  you that andrew and neither are the left wing pundits and press who are running with trump's [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3261.6s)]
*  not sure whether he has to follow the constitution as the headline out of that interview [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3268.48s)]
*  that's utter nonsense they're also asking the wrong question if if 11 million people come into [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3273.36s)]
*  the country illegally and unchecked so we have no idea who they are and and then and nobody says [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3278.2400000000002s)]
*  anything about the rule of law then the fact that the rule of law is being broken to the level [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3283.6000000000004s)]
*  at amazin levels and then suddenly he has to try each one of them which is not in the constitution [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3287.2000000000003s)]
*  as you say they have they have a certain amount of due process but it's much more limited than [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3293.04s)]
*  the due process you and i would get in similar circumstances he's supposed to not be able to [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3297.44s)]
*  have to deport them one by one that's basically making turning the constitution into a suicide [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3302.96s)]
*  pact and i think this is the thing that they that actually should be the question why are they here [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3308.32s)]
*  why were they let in why didn't the press make a big fuss i mean you had to watch you really had [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3313.36s)]
*  to watch fox news to find out that this was going on during the biden administration if you were [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3318.08s)]
*  watching television there was no way to know that these people were pouring in up to 180 000 [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3322.72s)]
*  in a single month where last month i think we had three and and we were told by the president that [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3328.7999999999997s)]
*  he couldn't stop it he didn't have the power to stop it we were told by the head of homeland [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3334.24s)]
*  security that it was fine that border was was secure we were lied to again and again and again [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3338.56s)]
*  and and you know it's really interesting to me that the press has been making a big fuss over [[00:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3344.16s)]
*  whether or not they knew that joe biden had dementia i mean everybody knew but except for [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3348.16s)]
*  the media but they're saying oh well maybe we didn't cover that well but they lied about [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3352.8799999999997s)]
*  everything they lied about everything by not asking they lied about everything by trusting [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3357.12s)]
*  officials and they're still lying politicians and they're still lying and the thing is this [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3361.04s)]
*  everything they do is about the destruction of the country i mean i don't understand well i sort of [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3366.16s)]
*  do understand why it is that the democrat party one of our two major parties is supporting the [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3371.6s)]
*  rights of murderers and rapists over the rights of the people who are being murdered and raped [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3377.6s)]
*  you know let me play another sound bite on the on that same front because they got into the [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3382.3199999999997s)]
*  question of the border and you know trump's basically saying to her isn't it wonderful to [[00:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3386.16s)]
*  say the border secure and she's obsessing now about can your emergency declaration that justified [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3390.08s)]
*  closing it remain in place now that it's secure can it can it can it watch border crossings are [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3395.12s)]
*  at their lowest level ever recorded is the border is that good is the border now secure [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3400.88s)]
*  yeah it's really secure it's absolutely when you say that isn't it a beautiful thing when you say [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3407.2000000000003s)]
*  it's the most secure it's ever been in the history of our country isn't that a nice statement well [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3413.44s)]
*  i'm i'm curious to know what it means you declared a national emergency on the southern border will [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3418.48s)]
*  you lift that that emergency well the biggest emergency is the courts aren't allowing us to [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3425.04s)]
*  take really we're going to talk about that but talk to me first about this emergency talk to me [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3429.92s)]
*  first about this that's such a leftist right first of all she won't say yes why can't you say yes [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3434.4s)]
*  it's like if you said isn't it a good thing that the the nationwide number of abortions [[00:57:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3441.84s)]
*  is down like if you were to say that she would never say yes to that like [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3446.16s)]
*  whether you're pro-choice or not isn't it better that we're killing fewer babies like you can't [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3449.6s)]
*  say that there's certain things that should be not controversial the secure border is one of them [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3454.2400000000002s)]
*  but she won't and where does she pivot to okay maybe you're saying she's being objective she [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3459.12s)]
*  doesn't want to offer her opinion fine so where does she pivot to um like maybe how are you going [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3464.72s)]
*  to keep it that way sir no when are we lifting the emergency declaration so it could become [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3469.52s)]
*  unsecure again well this is the way they cover republicans in general of course with trump [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3474.56s)]
*  everything is amped up to the highest level but it's it's like the guy has been actually had a [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3480.08s)]
*  very successful first hundred days it's almost been been a giddy success especially at the border [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3484.48s)]
*  that's the major thing but everything he does is looked at from a negative point of view i mean [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3491.2s)]
*  even if you read the wall street journal it's hilarious they say well prices haven't risen [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3496.4s)]
*  but they might they might rise stocks are going up but they might go down you know you know it's [[00:58:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3500.48s)]
*  like it's like being visited it's like having the news reported by the ghost of christmas yet to come [[00:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3505.6s)]
*  you know you're not seeing the things that that will be you're seeing seeing the things that might [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3509.92s)]
*  be and everything he does is a mistake and the fact is his record is really good i mean i understand [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3513.6s)]
*  that he doesn't talk like other politicians i don't think he thinks like other politicians i think [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3520.3199999999997s)]
*  he thinks more artistically in a way he sees things he sees a gestalt instead of looking at one [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3524.56s)]
*  problem and this problem or that problem but he's he's been quite successful you know the only time [[00:58:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3529.8399999999997s)]
*  i think he ever made a really really serious mistake was when he listened to experts on covid [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3535.2799999999997s)]
*  that was his biggest that was the biggest error of his first term and so the fact that he's not [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3540.48s)]
*  listening to experts now is is to me kind of thrilling you know this thing everything he does [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3544.56s)]
*  everything he does is covered as if it's a disaster and as if it's a problem and and what i think is [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3551.2s)]
*  happening again i think this is a failed elite that is basically being thrown quietly dragged [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3556.72s)]
*  out of power as they deserve as they well deserve after their failure during covid which was one of [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3562.64s)]
*  the biggest failures of a leadership class since world war one as they're being evicted they're [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3567.04s)]
*  holding on but and they only have one strategy which is to demonize donald trump and hope he [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3571.7599999999998s)]
*  does something wrong when they can say see see we were right all along and i i assume what the [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3576.8s)]
*  the point is to keep their base intact to keep this radical base intact and then eventually find [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3582.08s)]
*  some you know patemkin candidate who stands up and looks like he's a normal person but will [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3587.44s)]
*  actually be controlled by the deep state and what trump is trying to do is he's trying to debilitate [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3592.32s)]
*  the deep state he's trying to gut it he's trying to take away its props in in its bureaucracies and [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3596.64s)]
*  its agencies that have absolutely no responsibility he is trying to get rid of the invasion of people [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3601.92s)]
*  who came into this country with absolutely illegally while the president is responsible for [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3607.68s)]
*  keeping that border closed and he's trying he's trying to change the very nature of a country [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3612.96s)]
*  that has been going downhill for the last several years and i think when we look over at europe i [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3619.2s)]
*  mean this is this was to me my favorite moment of the trump the second trump administration [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3624.24s)]
*  administration so far was jd vance's munich speech where he asked the question if in if in britain [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3628.64s)]
*  they're arresting people for praying silently in their own homes because they're too their home is [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3634.3199999999997s)]
*  too close to an abortion clinic how are they like us anymore and so the left wants all of us to be [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3638.7999999999997s)]
*  in that situation that is where they're headed that is where they they want to go europe is a [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3644.3999999999996s)]
*  dead culture and i think the one thing we have to do is like the end of the movie et we have to sort [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3648.72s)]
*  of separate and sort of say no you know we're a living culture we want to keep the the values and [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3653.28s)]
*  the principles that made us the greatest country that's ever existed on earth we want to keep them [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3658.48s)]
*  in place and that's what they're fighting against that's the battle that trump is in and you know i [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3663.2000000000003s)]
*  have to tell you i don't think everything trump does is right i don't think everything he says [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3668.1600000000003s)]
*  is right but i'm on his side because i think he is defending a western culture that has given us [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3671.44s)]
*  everything we have and it's been i think that you know i think that's been the greatest culture that [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3676.8s)]
*  earth has produced and so you know i i think that it's fine it would be fine for a reporter [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3680.88s)]
*  to pick on something he does wrong but they pick on everything he does as if it's wrong and i think [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3687.52s)]
*  that everything they highlight is in line with their narrative which is we do need open borders [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=3692.4s)]

*  completely wrong to do so jason riley is a columnist for the wall street journal and a senior [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4664.0s)]
*  fellow at the manhattan institute his new book the affirmative action myth why blacks don't need [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4669.44s)]
*  racial preferences to succeed is out tomorrow and highlights how black achievement was on the rise [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4675.92s)]
*  before racial preference policies which actually had the opposite effect of the one that was [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4681.12s)]
*  intended jason great to see you again so this is a great follow-up i know you've had other books [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4687.36s)]
*  too to please stop helping us which was your earlier book about how the government just oh [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4692.24s)]
*  so desperately wants to quote help the black community and every time they try to they set [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4698.8s)]
*  blacks back generationally and this book seems to dovetail perfectly with your earlier book as well [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4704.08s)]
*  as with a film that we profiled on this show five years ago from shelby and eli steel what killed [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4710.24s)]
*  michael brown which takes a look at fergus in missouri and talks about how blacks were moving up [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4717.36s)]
*  the socioeconomic scale in terms of neighborhoods and families and communities and earnings and then [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4722.96s)]
*  came linden johnson's great society which was meant to quote help and completely undermine all of that [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4728.88s)]
*  progress so give us the basic thesis of your book well you you laid it out pretty well and it's good [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4736.16s)]
*  to see you again megan um what prompted me to write this book was all the chatter around the [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4742.5599999999995s)]
*  supreme court decision in 2023 students for fair admissions versus harvard and there was a lot of [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4749.36s)]
*  anticipation that the court would rule the way it eventually did that racial preferences violated [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4755.12s)]
*  the 14th amendment equal protection clause and were unconstitutional and um but the talk in the [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4761.28s)]
*  media particularly among the left wing elites black and white was that this would be a devastating [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4768.08s)]
*  blow to the black middle class that these policies that the supreme court was about to strike down [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4775.5199999999995s)]
*  had created the black middle class and that without special treatment without racial favoritism [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4781.599999999999s)]
*  you know the black middle class would be decimated and i said wait a minute that is not [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4788.56s)]
*  what the historical record shows there was a black middle class well before affirmative action [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4793.360000000001s)]
*  policies took effect in the 1970s and in fact that black middle class was growing at a significantly [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4799.4400000000005s)]
*  faster rate than it grew during the era of affirmative action so that's why i wrote the [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4806.240000000001s)]
*  book to take on some of these false narratives out there that want to credit government programs and [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4812.0s)]
*  expanded welfare state racial preferences and so forth with black uplift when in fact that is not [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4817.68s)]
*  what drove black uplift in this country historically what what does affirmative action do at the college [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4823.76s)]
*  level to the black students and those around them well it's what it does to any student megan that [[01:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4830.8s)]
*  is admitted without the credentials of the surrounding students at the same institution [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4839.6s)]
*  that's the issue here it's as i've said before if you admitted to harvard left-handed redheads [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4845.36s)]
*  with sat scores that were 300 points below those of the average harvard student you would see [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4852.719999999999s)]
*  left-handed redheads pooling at the bottom of the class you'd see them dropping out at higher rates [[01:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4858.32s)]
*  you'd see them switching from harder majors to easier majors that's just the way it works the [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4863.28s)]
*  most important credential for a student going to any institution is that they have to match the [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4868.639999999999s)]
*  academic preparation of the surrounding kids at that school and when there's a gap that is what [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4874.56s)]
*  that's when you run into trouble and affirmative action mismatches kids with schools and we often [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4880.96s)]
*  speak of it in racial terms but the same could be true of children of alumni the same could be true [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4886.8s)]
*  of student athletes the children of donors and so forth anytime there's a mismatch with the child [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4891.76s)]
*  and the institution you're going to see those kids pooling at the bottom of the class and we have a [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4898.240000000001s)]
*  ton of evidence showing this one of my favorite studies that point this out is one done by an [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4903.12s)]
*  economist at duke university who interviewed freshmen at duke and asked them what they wanted [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4911.04s)]
*  to major in and the students that were black black men in particular were asked whether they [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4917.84s)]
*  wanted to major in the stem fields or in i should say the natural sciences and economics and what [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4924.32s)]
*  happened was about 75 or so of black freshmen males at duke so they wanted to major in the [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4931.12s)]
*  in natural sciences or economics but only about 35 ended up with a degree in those fields [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4938.16s)]
*  so you had a 35 point attrition rate among white males it was four points the attrition rate [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4946.08s)]
*  and what the economist showed was that what what what produced this result what accounted for this [[01:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4953.84s)]
*  disparity entirely was whether the student had been admitted to the school with the same credentials [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4960.4800000000005s)]
*  as other kids at duke in other words duke admits some black kids that do meet the standards of [[01:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4967.360000000001s)]
*  other kids and some black kids who don't and that attrition rate could be explained entirely by which [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4972.16s)]
*  black student we were talking about those blacks that had been admitted to duke with the same [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4977.68s)]
*  credentials as everyone else at duke ended up with a degree in that major those who didn't [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4982.0s)]
*  switched out of the major and so that shows you the mismatch effect of affirmative action [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4986.8s)]
*  and i remember from it was either one of our earlier discussions or maybe it was heather [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4991.76s)]
*  mcdonald your your colleague at the manhattan institute but one of you guys was telling me [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=4996.0s)]
*  unfortunately what happens with a lot of the folks who then do not they're not able to compete in the [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5000.8s)]
*  sciences and they they were on their way to getting an economics degree but instead they they couldn't [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5006.08s)]
*  make it this so they wind up majoring in like african-american studies or women's studies [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5011.2s)]
*  which are degrees with which you can do absolutely nothing right and what it also shows is again how [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5017.44s)]
*  counterproductive the policy is so when for instance uh california banned uh race racial [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5025.04s)]
*  admissions back in the mid-90s and by the way a number of states nine or ten states even prior to [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5031.92s)]
*  the supreme court's decision had already done this in big states texas florida california so we [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5037.28s)]
*  have some idea of what's going to happen in the absence of these policies and what happened in [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5042.8s)]
*  california is that yes for a period immediately after the ban went into effect the most selective [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5047.12s)]
*  schools in the california system berkeley and ucla saw a reduction in black and hispanic [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5053.2s)]
*  enrollment but the university of california system overall saw an increase in enrollment [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5059.36s)]
*  because kids were going to schools where they were better matched and more importantly what [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5065.12s)]
*  california saw was a sharp increase in the graduation rates of black and hispanic students [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5070.5599999999995s)]
*  throughout the system including in those more difficult stem fields computer science engineering [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5077.28s)]
*  physics and so forth much much higher gpas much much higher graduation rates because kids were [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5083.04s)]
*  being better matched with schools and one of the and so my point is that a policy that was put in [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5089.36s)]
*  place to help increase the ranks of the black middle class at the end of the day was resulting [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5095.759999999999s)]
*  in fewer black doctors and black lawyers and black engineers than we would have had in the absence [[01:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5102.16s)]
*  of the policy and i think one of the real tragedies here megan is that when you look at [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5108.0s)]
*  these black kids who are who are admitted to some of these selective schools with lower standards [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5112.4s)]
*  what you find is that they have higher standards than the average college student in this country [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5118.16s)]
*  they're just lower than they are for students at those more selective schools so these kids [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5124.0s)]
*  would be hitting it out of the park academically at a less selective institution i mean if they're [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5129.36s)]
*  going to michigan state instead of michigan if they're going to um you know the uh north carolina [[01:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5135.599999999999s)]
*  instead of u n c exactly you're going to have them graduating with the degrees they want these are [[01:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5141.92s)]
*  not it's not that these kids are unqualified for college it's just they have been put into a [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5147.6s)]
*  situation where they're in over their head academically where the pace that's that that [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5152.320000000001s)]
*  that uh classes are taught at is much faster than they're used to so you're turning really smart kids [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5156.56s)]
*  into artificial failures in the name of helping them and so i you know good riddance to affirmative [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5162.4800000000005s)]
*  action is what i say well and the other piece of it is they've they've ruined what used to be [[01:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5169.52s)]
*  these like really coveted exciting sexy degrees like harvard or yale or columbia because now [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5176.88s)]

*  there based on their own merit are getting dragged down with that same eye roll unfairly [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5201.68s)]
*  yeah exactly you um you you have not only turned a lot of kids into artificial failures [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5207.360000000001s)]
*  the the ones that who are successful on their own merit their success is somehow tainted by these [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5213.04s)]
*  policies no one wants to be and what self-respecting person wants to be the token on campus or in the [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5218.64s)]
*  workplace and that is what affirmative action is done it's also reinforces stereotypes and the [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5224.88s)]
*  justices got into this in the majority opinion if you go to an elite school and you're surrounded [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5230.24s)]
*  by minority kids who clearly don't belong there and are struggling in class and so forth you leave [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5237.12s)]
*  college with a certain view of the intellectual capabilities of minorities that's what these [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5242.96s)]
*  programs are doing they're reinforcing that stereotype by setting up these kids to fail and [[01:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5248.4s)]
*  it's a and it's a real shame and the point i'm making in the book is that in the era prior to [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5253.28s)]
*  affirmative action this is not what was happening kids were attending black kids were attending [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5258.72s)]
*  schools where they met the credentials and they were graduating and they were closing the gap [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5264.88s)]
*  megan with white college graduates the rate at which blacks were entering school and graduating [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5270.72s)]
*  from college was getting closer and closer to the white rate and what we know from the data is that [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5276.240000000001s)]
*  around 1970 that convergence stalled the right the rate of college completion among blacks [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5283.28s)]
*  is the same today as it was in 1970 that's the legacy of affirmative action [[01:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5290.639999999999s)]
*  because what did it do is a practical matter i mean explain why did it stall because what what the [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5297.5199999999995s)]
*  left will tell you is because this is a racist country and the stain of jim crow could never be [[01:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5301.759999999999s)]
*  erased and the stain of slavery could never be erased so they kind of got as far as they could [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5306.16s)]
*  get and everything else is going to have to come frankly from whitey you know opening up doors [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5310.08s)]
*  and creating opportunities a lot about yeah well the narrative is to talk a lot about the legacy [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5315.68s)]
*  of slavery and the legacy of jim crow not to talk about the legacy of affirmative action or the legacy [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5319.92s)]
*  of the great society under linda and johnson and that's what happened in the 1970s and the [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5325.68s)]
*  late 1960s is we had these expansions of government programs and i think they interfered [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5332.24s)]
*  with the black development that had been ongoing and ongoing again in a much faster pace than before [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5339.68s)]
*  i mean when you look i'll give you an example with employment in the late 1960s something like [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5346.4800000000005s)]
*  80 percent of the least educated blacks had a job by the early 1990s it was down to fewer than half [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5352.72s)]
*  of the least educated blacks had a job there again is affirmative action in practice [[01:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5362.08s)]
*  and one of the other things that happened during this period megan and it's why affirmative action [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5368.48s)]
*  was so ineffective i believe one of the reasons is the deterioration of the black family so there [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5374.48s)]
*  was not only this convergence going on in terms of educational achievement there was also a [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5380.48s)]
*  convergence going on in terms of black earnings as a percentage of white earnings blacks again in the [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5384.88s)]
*  pre-affirmative action were closing the gap gaps were narrowing in economic advancement [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5390.88s)]
*  advancement so the median income of blacks was getting closer to the median income of household [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5397.28s)]
*  income of whites but what you saw between the late 60s and the early 90s in particular was a [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5404.24s)]
*  deterioration in black couple headed households married blacks heading the household and he saw [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5412.639999999999s)]
*  an explosion of single black parenting and so that economic advancements simply could not keep up [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5419.759999999999s)]
*  among blacks because obviously married couples make more money than single couple than someone [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5425.28s)]
*  who's single and running a household and so because you saw this proliferation of solo parenting [[01:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5430.24s)]
*  in the black community that economic convergence that narrowing of the black white gap in earnings [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5436.639999999999s)]
*  started moving in the opposite direction and affirmative action could not make up for it [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5442.32s)]
*  and the great society programs and the war on poverty efforts could not make up for it even [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5447.679999999999s)]
*  a black president and obama could not make up for it as i often said back at the time [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5452.88s)]
*  is that we learn once again that a black man in the white house is not as important as a black [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5458.16s)]
*  man in the home even you know you can tell economically that is not something that lends [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5464.0s)]
*  itself to political intervention this is something culturally going on among black americas and you [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5470.64s)]
*  see the legacy of single parent families and again that's another point that i get into in the book [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5477.28s)]
*  well there you touch on another point which is very dicey it's it's full of plutonium this [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5484.8s)]
*  this point but you write if black youth in more recent decades have adopted an oppositional [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5491.28s)]
*  mindset it has been with the approval of many intellectual elites who excuse and justify behavior [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5496.639999999999s)]
*  that previous generations once discouraged and condemned so can you speak to what it used to be [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5503.12s)]
*  like versus i know what you're saying now it's like these white leftist elites who will bend [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5510.32s)]
*  over backwards to be like don't punish the black students no black students can get suspended [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5515.44s)]
*  stop saying two plus two equals four just because it does you know if a black student says it's five [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5520.64s)]
*  it's five that's your white supremacy speaking but what was it like before well what you saw [[01:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5525.28s)]
*  was an attempt to for blacks and this again is what you saw in the first half first two-thirds [[01:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5532.48s)]
*  of the 20th century what you saw was an attempt among blacks to assimilate to middle-class values [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5539.759999999999s)]
*  and this was the focus of the black leadership behave yourself you know pull up your pants [[01:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5547.12s)]
*  finish school take care of your children these were priorities how you present yourself matters [[01:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5554.32s)]
*  and that was the belief of the black leadership martin luther king believed that thurgood marshall [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5561.280000000001s)]
*  believed that how you present yourself to whites yes we there's racism yes we have to fight for [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5566.88s)]
*  equal rights but there are also things that we have to be responsible to for ourselves the things [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5572.240000000001s)]
*  we can't continue blaming whites for indefinitely and and they were very specific about that it was [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5578.160000000001s)]
*  very common among the black leadership you just don't hear that sort of talk today it's it's [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5583.76s)]
*  derided as respectability politics and people say well it didn't work and because there's still [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5589.84s)]
*  racial disparities in this country and my point is that it didn't not work because of the the [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5596.96s)]
*  track record of advance that i just laid out when it came to incomes and educational attainment [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5603.2s)]
*  oh yes it was working quite well we just stopped practicing it and that is the problem it's not [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5608.32s)]
*  that it doesn't work it's that we stopped practicing it and by the way it was extremely [[01:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5613.84s)]
*  successful it was the type of mindset that produced brown versus board of education and [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5618.24s)]
*  and it's produced the civil rights act of 1964 the voting rights act of 1965 that generation of [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5623.2s)]
*  black leadership had solid solid accomplishments and they were very much focused on respectability [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5629.84s)]
*  politics and the behavior of black people i want to ask you about what's happening with the mech [[01:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5636.32s)]
*  gala tonight because we started the show by talking about how it's like about the black [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5643.28s)]

*  look like she's she's a woman who's relatable and she cares about the black community but meanwhile [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5665.12s)]

*  so one of the people who they had to bring on like a black committee that they pointed out in [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5674.8s)]
*  the new york times has a meeting at the apollo theater jason so they're legit they're at the [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5679.36s)]

*  from black people showing up to celebrate black culture meanwhile you you make a pretty strong [[01:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5719.92s)]
*  case that it is the left that set a portion of the black community down the lane of prizing the black [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5725.84s)]
*  whatever durag the pimp cane and so on as opposed to folding into the middle class and there being [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YlvrQkgc3E4&t=5732.88s)]
