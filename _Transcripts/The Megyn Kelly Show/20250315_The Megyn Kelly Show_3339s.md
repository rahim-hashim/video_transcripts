**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 15, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and a special weekend edition [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm taping this on Friday afternoon [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=6.0s)]
*  I've been with my kids and Doug all week on spring break came back on Friday and did an hour live with the audience [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=8.34s)]
*  On Sirius XM triumph channel 111 on our special series on baby Lisa a case [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=15.44s)]
*  We will continue to follow but it's been such a busy Newsweek that I'm here with this special episode just to break down [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=21.62s)]
*  Some of the stories that were driving me insane this week [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=28.939999999999998s)]
*  And then we're gonna start with the new show on Monday with Glenn Greenwald at that point [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=32.379999999999995s)]
*  I will still be on spring break, but not on vacation [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=37.78s)]
*  I will be moving locations, but I will not be on vacation [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=40.78s)]
*  But I just needed to get to a couple of these stories which are not evergreen and I [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=43.62s)]
*  Needed to talk to you about them before they got old [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=47.66s)]
*  And before Glenn gets here some of which he'll have no interest in some of which he will [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=50.3s)]

*  These days personal safety is not something that can be left to chance [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=62.28s)]
*  Whether at home on the road or just living everyday life having a reliable way to protect yourself and your family is crucial [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=65.88s)]
*  That's why Berna is the choice for so many [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=72.28s)]
*  Berna is a game-changing less lethal self-defense tool [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=75.2s)]
*  Compact powerful and easy to use it provides the confidence to act in any situation [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=79.32000000000001s)]
*  Berna uses non lethal rounds tear gas pepper and kinetic projectiles to effectively stop a threat from a safe distance [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=84.04s)]
*  And the best part Berna can be shipped direct to your door and it's legal in all 50 states [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  Berna is proudly American with products hand-assembled in Fort Wayne, Indiana [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=98.36000000000001s)]
*  Look sometimes a firearm is not the right choice for you and Berna provides a powerful alternative [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=102.24000000000001s)]
*  Protect what matters most with Berna visit Berna comm that's byrna.com [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=107.48s)]
*  Slash Megan to receive a 10% discount and learn why thousands of people and law enforcement agencies are [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=112.92s)]
*  Trying out Berna's less lethal protection Berna non lethal self-defense always ready [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=119.64s)]
*  Alright, we're gonna get to all of it. So let me just dig right in [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=127.64s)]
*  number one and I'm sure Glenn and I are gonna be discussing this the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=131.88s)]
*  Left is melting down over the Trump administration's attempt to deport this leader of this shockingly [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=135.36s)]
*  anti-semitic group on the campus of Columbia University and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=141.64000000000001s)]
*  His name is Mahmoud Khalil [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=146.88s)]
*  KHA LIL [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=149.64s)]
*  He has been arrested. He has had a student visa [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=151.88s)]
*  withdrawn and he has had his green card withdrawn and the left has made him into Rosa Parks [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=156.2s)]
*  That he is a civil rights figure of our time [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=162.92000000000002s)]
*  That he was simply exercising his right to free speech and that this is an unfair and disgusting [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=166.32s)]
*  Crackdown on it and it's not just the left. It's some people [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=171.76s)]
*  I mean Glenn is of the left, but you know, obviously makes a ton of sense and we love Glenn and he's a lawyer [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=175.14s)]
*  And he's smart. Yeah, I would say he's much more [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=180.84s)]
*  Antagonistic to Israel than than most of the people on the right are that's fine. Totally fine [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=184.07999999999998s)]
*  But he is definitely defensive of Khalil here saying that this is this is unconstitutional [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=189.44s)]
*  What the government's doing to him that's a crackdown on free speech and he's not the only one our friends over at fire [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=195.88s)]
*  That which is big on campus free speech. They are against what the Trump administration is doing to Khalil [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=202.2s)]
*  Ricky Schlott who interned for our show writes for the New York Post now and also co-wrote a book with the guy who runs fire [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=208.0s)]
*  She she's been posting against it there [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=215.56s)]
*  There are some folks on the right who have free speech concerns about what's happening here [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=217.84s)]
*  So it's not just a leftist issue, but having taken a few days to look at the law [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=221.95999999999998s)]
*  I have zero qualms about this guy getting his ass booted back to Syria [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=226.67999999999998s)]
*  Goodbye Khalil enjoy Syria or wherever you wind up. I really don't give a shit where it is. He [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=233.35999999999999s)]
*  Got a golden ticket into the United States of America [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=240.92s)]
*  We gave him a student visa. He got into one of our most prestigious [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=246.32s)]
*  Universities we let him study [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=251.16s)]
*  alongside American kids who were the next generation of leadership and what did he do he decided to [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=253.6s)]
*  Join up with this group that is without a question pro hamas [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=260.56s)]
*  That was allegedly distributing pro hamas [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=266.4s)]
*  pamphlets leaflets [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=270.56s)]
*  promotional materials he was extremely defensive of what had been done by [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=272.64s)]
*  Hamas on 10-7 and he recognized that even though he was here on a temporary [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=279.44s)]
*  Status. Yes, we give him a green card, but that you're not a citizen yet [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=286.88s)]
*  That he he should be in a more of a like supportive role for this organization that was organizing to hell on on Columbia's campus [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=290.32s)]
*  But he still took part. He couldn't quite keep it together long enough to get citizenship [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=297.44s)]
*  It was that important to him. And so by his own admission [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=302.88s)]
*  He was a spokesperson for the group that was on Columbia's campus last year [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=306.44s)]
*  Causing all the havoc were they there to protest all the dead babies in Israel? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=312.59999999999997s)]
*  No, they weren't they actually looked at that as an acceptable form of armed resistance [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=318.08s)]
*  We heard that from Khalil's own mouth at least according to a fellow student at Columbia who posted a video of him [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=324.64s)]
*  Speaking for the group whose spokesman he was [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=332.96s)]
*  Justifying armed resistance against Israel. This is again post 10-7 Columbia student David letterer posted this on X on March 11th [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=336.06s)]
*  It's a little hard to hear but try to listen here in South 14a [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=344.26s)]
*  I'm [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=365.06s)]
*  Okay, so what you heard there is Palestinians have tried multiple forms of resistance whether it's armed unarmed resistance peaceful whatever [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=374.9s)]
*  But Israel and their propaganda always find something to attack. We tried armed resistance, which is again legitimate under international law [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=381.22s)]
*  But again Israel it is terrorism. So that's okay. That's a that's a point of view [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=388.98s)]
*  we don't have to actually support him in that point of view because what he's really doing there is endorsing Hamas and it's to its [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=394.86s)]
*  terror tactics and [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=402.78000000000003s)]
*  Endorsing a terrorist group now gets you on to even shake your ground. Okay, but we're still in speech [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=404.62s)]
*  So he's still on firmer, you know terra firma versus what actually is gonna get him deported [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=409.48s)]
*  I'm just giving you background on who this guy is [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=415.76000000000005s)]
*  So then he goes and he decides to be the spokesperson [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=418.71999999999997s)]
*  For the group that took over Hamilton Hall that had campus [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=421.68s)]
*  Encampments that made it difficult for Jewish students to pass from a to B on the campus of Columbia [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=425.59999999999997s)]
*  That made it impossible for anyone Jewish students professors [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=431.92s)]
*  cops to enter Hamilton Hall a facility for which all students pay including the Jews [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=436.2s)]
*  But they weren't wanted because this group took over Hamilton Hall acted like a bunch of thugs [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=444.14000000000004s)]
*  put barricades up against the doors smashed windows with their cafe as on and [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=450.68s)]
*  Effectively held hostage for a time a couple of security guards who were in the building including, you know [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=458.70000000000005s)]
*  Guys maintenance workers who weren't making a lot of dough who felt personally threatened [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=465.26000000000005s)]
*  But here's some video just in case you have forgotten about what his darling little student group that he's the spokesman for he was the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=469.32s)]
*  negotiator for did at Columbia last year [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=476.28s)]
*  The caption reads from our side of the barricades [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=490.44s)]
*  And sure enough it's all these cafe outwearing Columbia students screaming and leaning full body leaning against the doors [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=493.66s)]
*  with large wooden doors, and there are several sets of them into [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=501.71999999999997s)]
*  Hamilton Hall free free Palestine as they chant [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=505.76s)]
*  Oh [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=508.38s)]
*  They've got ladders they're using the barricade the doors stun grenades now are going off [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=522.02s)]
*  Cops are trying to get in [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=534.06s)]
*  Let us not dialogue with our [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=539.34s)]
*  Persecutors they're called police officers and when they tell you to sit your ass down [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=541.78s)]
*  You do it or you get arrested or possibly [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=546.9399999999999s)]
*  Deported Khalil now [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=551.18s)]
*  He was smart enough not to actually go as far as we know to that particular event because he was [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=553.46s)]
*  Trying to become one of us. He was trying to become a US citizen. It's a no. Okay, it's a no, sir [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=558.3s)]
*  Enjoy Syria [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=565.22s)]
*  Zero chance he's becoming an American citizen now, but he wants to hold on to that green card [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=567.18s)]
*  He wants to stay here in the United States [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=571.3s)]
*  And he says oh I married a married to an American and I'm expecting an American baby should have thought of that before last year [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=572.8199999999999s)]
*  Bye get out who the hell feel sorry for this guy. He'll do fine in Syria his ideology seems to [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=579.0999999999999s)]
*  Parallel perfectly what he will find over there. You'll love it Sharia law [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=586.3s)]
*  You can find it in lots of places in the Middle East take your pick but not here in America [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=590.3599999999999s)]
*  Bye [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=596.6s)]
*  So what did he do? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=597.9200000000001s)]
*  He act acted as the liaison between this [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=600.32s)]
*  Lawless student group and the university and continued to go into this is our understanding as of this date [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=605.0400000000001s)]
*  There hasn't been a full recitation of it [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=611.1600000000001s)]
*  But I've spent the weekend pouring through the reports and what we do know about him and it appears there's no question [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=612.84s)]
*  He was the spokesperson for this group that was behind the encampments and behind the taking of Hamilton Hall and he was in there [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=618.36s)]
*  With the administrators apparently on a daily basis saying basically you give us what we want [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=623.92s)]
*  Which is to divest Columbia from all of Israel or you get more Hamilton Halls [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=628.9599999999999s)]
*  Do you understand and Annie McCarthy of National Review has had a couple of great pieces of this on this one on Fox News [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=634.4799999999999s)]
*  one on that and are and he likened this to the [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=640.4799999999999s)]
*  To the guy Robert Duvall character in the Godfather Tom Hogan [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=644.8s)]
*  Who went over to see the movie producer who wouldn't cast the Frank Sinatra like character in that movie in his movie and you know [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=649.78s)]
*  just kind of like [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=657.26s)]
*  Be great if you'd cast him. No, love it if you cast him. Yeah, I'm not I'm not muscle [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=658.9399999999999s)]
*  I'm just the lawyer but jeez we really appreciate appreciate it if you cast him in this role and [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=663.9s)]
*  The Hollywood guy is like no f off [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=669.8199999999999s)]
*  Nobody tells me how to cast my movies and then he got a head horse in his bed his favorite racing horse [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=672.9399999999999s)]
*  wound up with its bloody head in his bed and one of the most [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=678.5s)]
*  infamous or famous scenes from that movie most memorable for sure and [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=682.0600000000001s)]
*  It's as if you have that guy saying what I just it was speech [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=687.62s)]
*  All I said is I'm not here to threaten you but you know [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=691.58s)]
*  We'd really appreciate it if you put him if you put him in you know, it's a threat [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=696.4200000000001s)]
*  You're acting as the muscle you really are the implicit muscle for a terror group [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=701.4200000000001s)]
*  A lawless group and a terror group frankly on Columbia campus. This guy was in there saying [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=708.22s)]
*  You divest from Israel or you get the hose again. You get it? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=714.3000000000001s)]
*  that's how this is gonna go down he was the guy doing that and [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=719.6600000000001s)]
*  Even the Columbia administrators left the farthest left people you could probably find in America kept saying no [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=723.7s)]
*  We're not gonna do that Khalil. No your requests are a little bit much even for us and [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=730.5s)]
*  The student group would not disband and that is why the NYPD had to break down the doors with stun grenades [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=735.98s)]
*  None of that shit is lawful. They were guilty of trespassing of resisting arrest of destruction of property [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=743.98s)]
*  There may have been assaults there [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=751.98s)]
*  There have been plenty of criminal charges that have been unleashed on some 40 plus [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=753.54s)]
*  People who participated in what we saw there on camera and the related events now [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=759.26s)]
*  Khalil may or may not have been one of them. I don't know [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=765.34s)]
*  I know he has joined a motion to stop the university from releasing [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=768.38s)]
*  What it knows about Khalil to? [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=773.98s)]
*  The federal government which is trying to find out right now [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=777.58s)]
*  He and some handful of others have just filed a motion trying to stop the university from revealing the full extent of what they know [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=780.34s)]
*  About Khalil good luck with that. Okay, if you didn't do anything that's problematic with just speech [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=787.46s)]
*  It was just your little speeches your thoughts [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=792.3000000000001s)]
*  Why are you why would you want to stop it from going to the fence? [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=794.7s)]
*  You should actually be thrilled to see that go should be like it's speech. Hello. I'm practically an American [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=797.46s)]
*  I've got my green card. All I did was speak words pro-hamas words, but they were words [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=803.62s)]
*  No [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=808.74s)]
*  There's a reason he doesn't want that stuff released and by the way, there is a question [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=809.9s)]
*  Even if it's just words [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=814.1800000000001s)]
*  There is a question about whether he could be deported not withstanding the fact that he's got a green card [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=815.1800000000001s)]
*  That go listen to Annie McCarthy in his podcast on NR it's well worth your time and he talks about how [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=819.6999999999999s)]
*  This is what she hottest do and have been planning to do in America for a very long time [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=825.6999999999999s)]
*  They try to get into the country. They try to take advantage of our laws and our [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=830.2199999999999s)]
*  Constitution which is very permissive when it comes to the expression of ideas and the freedom of assembly and [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=835.1999999999999s)]
*  Then they try to martyr themselves and bit by bit change the law just to make it a bit more flexible a little bit better [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=841.06s)]
*  For their side and so there is a real reason for the Secretary of State to be able to say I consider [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=846.5s)]
*  That person not yet a citizen a threat to the foreign policy of the United States of America [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=853.46s)]
*  How so because we don't wish to send the message to other countries that they can send their jihad lovers over here to [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=859.86s)]
*  congregate on American campuses and try to convert our [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=867.5s)]
*  Youngsters who are impressionable young teenagers for at least the first half of college into joining the jihad [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=871.6999999999999s)]
*  Totally valid POV and there's no question the Secretary of State has the power to do that. Okay, that's just speech [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=879.26s)]
*  That's how the law is to me pretty clear [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=887.42s)]
*  It doesn't if what you're just speaking about is jihad or supportive terror [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=890.22s)]
*  Yeah, you're in trouble if you're not an actual citizen not if you're an American citizen not necessarily [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=896.58s)]
*  But if you're somebody who's less than a citizen asking us to continue the privilege of you staying here [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=900.98s)]
*  You're in trouble my friend and your conduct is where I really want this to land [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=905.62s)]
*  This guy did more than just speak. He acted like the Robert Duvall character. Nice University here [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=910.86s)]
*  Shame if anything were to happen to it [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=918.7s)]
*  All you have to do is divest from Israel. You can have your campus back [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=921.1400000000001s)]
*  We'll let the Jews pass. We'll let the cops come in. We're being perfectly [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=924.98s)]
*  I'll say it in my soft voice the one that Khalil uses when he talks on camera when he [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=928.9s)]
*  Presumably was dealing with administrators [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=936.38s)]
*  Yeah, I like I I would hate for more maintenance workers to get hurt [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=939.02s)]
*  I would hate for more cops to have to endanger their young lives [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=944.86s)]
*  I really would hate for more property that the Jews have paid for to get destroyed [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=949.22s)]
*  You're on this pretty little campus of yours [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=954.34s)]
*  Administrators fuck you mock mood get out. All right, so that's it Glenn Greenwald's coming on a Monday [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=957.2600000000001s)]
*  He and I am sure we'll have a robust debate about this because he's definitely on the other side and I love Glenn [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=963.86s)]
*  So he's just the man to do it with so that's exciting. We'll do that. Okay couple of other things that I definitely want to get to [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=968.58s)]
*  Elise Slotkin [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=976.46s)]
*  She went on the view she's a she's a new senator from Michigan and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=979.1800000000001s)]
*  I [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=982.62s)]
*  Never heard this person you probably haven't either but she's trying to make a name for herself because she's the newly elected senator from the state [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=983.74s)]
*  of Michigan and [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=989.7800000000001s)]
*  She was on the same ballot that elected Trump because Michigan went for Trump and she also got elected [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=990.98s)]
*  So she's like I'm the moderate, you know [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=996.14s)]
*  I'm the future you guys are gonna love me because [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=998.14s)]
*  You same people who put Trump in office and my friends in Michigan and I do have a lot of them [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1000.5400000000001s)]
*  Would you please listen to me? Michigan errs you elected an idiot. She's a nasty person [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1005.3000000000001s)]
*  She is a nasty nasty hard partisan and I realized you thought okay [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1010.0600000000001s)]
*  I'll put Trump in there and then I'll put this kind of moderate Democrat in but no she's not [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1014.98s)]
*  She's just as hard partisan as the rest of them. This is no moderate [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1019.5s)]
*  so she goes on the view this past week and [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1022.86s)]
*  Decides to try to explain [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1027.18s)]
*  Trump and Trump voters, you know, cuz she's from Michigan. She was on the same ballot. So she gets [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1029.22s)]
*  Trump she gets MAGA and here she was, you know, I guess all of our spokesperson [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1034.42s)]
*  person [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1038.82s)]
*  Explaining all of us to the view listen, I think there's a feeling in the country and I always often say this [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1039.78s)]
*  You know, we're we're about to turn 250 years old, right? [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1046.66s)]
*  We're still pretty young for a country. These are our like like our angry teenage years, right? [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1050.08s)]
*  We are going through this push and pull where we're happy. We're sad [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1055.5s)]
*  We want this we want that and what do you do when you have a teenager who's threatening? [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1059.02s)]
*  Themselves and others you just try to get them through this period alive so that their brain can fully form and you can come back to [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1063.9s)]
*  Kind of what what what country Trump? No, I'm talking about our country. We're pendulum swinging [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1070.9s)]
*  We're a bundle I'm swinging. And so for me, I think that this I don't think there's a single American who feels like this is normal [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1076.3799999999999s)]
*  Okay, well she's not talking about Trump but this is not normal everything Trump's doing is abnormal and it's because we're in our teenage years [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1084.3799999999999s)]
*  Where our brain is not fully formed. So we're just suffering a temporary form of of [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1090.62s)]
*  Neurosis of delusion of [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1096.1399999999999s)]
*  Insanity where that's that's our problem or there's these mature idiots whose brains have not yet matured but trust us Elise [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1099.1s)]
*  Somehow she's got the magic that we don't have like she's the mature one [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1106.1399999999999s)]
*  She's she's she sees more than we do. She knows better. She knows better [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1110.5s)]
*  Okay, like we're the dumb kids who need to be controlled. We just have to she's the patient parent. She's our daddy [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1115.0s)]
*  I told you she was bad. Do you remember? She was the one who decided to try to [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1120.9399999999998s)]
*  strangle Pete Hegseth [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1127.82s)]
*  during his confirmation hearing and unlike all the other women she did not appear in those highlight roles of [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1129.62s)]
*  like Maisie, her ono and Kirsten Gillibrand the ones who were pummeling Pete and we're like, ah [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1135.6599999999999s)]
*  She did not because she doesn't she doesn't sound like that. She doesn't sound like that. Ah [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1140.6999999999998s)]
*  but she is just as annoying probably more dangerous and [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1145.3799999999999s)]
*  Just as partisan that's the thing. I really want you to know [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1150.86s)]
*  Michiganders you did not elect a moderate and anybody thinking about this person as any sort of a moderate needs to reassess ASAP [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1154.4199999999998s)]
*  So for a couple of weeks or months now, I've been asking my team to put together these sound bites of that cross-examination [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1162.2199999999998s)]
*  she did of Pete and [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1168.12s)]
*  They've done a great job [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1169.9199999999998s)]
*  But they never got like all the pieces that I wanted so I actually went back myself and all my free time this week [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1171.1799999999998s)]
*  Which I did have a lot of it's only a seven-minute exchange [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1176.28s)]
*  And I picked my favorites. I personally put this one together [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1179.1399999999999s)]
*  It's a little disjointed, but you're gonna get the feeling of why I dislike this person so much [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1182.4599999999998s)]
*  And now this you know, I have my sound bite [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1186.74s)]
*  We don't go over a minute unless it's like extraordinary. This one's three minutes. Trust me. You're gonna get why I did it watch it [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1188.98s)]
*  I'm a CIA officer recruited after 9-eleven. I did three tours armed in Iraq alongside the military [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1195.3s)]
*  and [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1202.62s)]
*  Have worked for four different secretaries of defense both Democrat and Republican proudly [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=1204.6599999999999s)]

*  Misgendering is hate speech. They say that is what representative faith was accused of misgendering [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2050.46s)]
*  Sarah formerly Tim McBride [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2057.3s)]
*  Misgendering what he did was actually gendered [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2060.02s)]
*  Tim now Sarah correctly. I'm not trying to be disrespectful of [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2064.1800000000003s)]

*  The show is by [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2952.98s)]
*  Okay reading that from my team which translates [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2958.4s)]
*  to fecal matter [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2962.1s)]
*  Piece of shit, which is absolutely true. So are they are they just trolling us because this is a piece of shit [[00:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2964.02s)]
*  attempted fashion [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2970.7400000000002s)]
*  It's a canadian design duo named hannah rose dalton and stephen raj [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2972.1s)]
*  baskaran [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2978.34s)]
*  And those are the ones who chose a bald overweight man [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2980.34s)]
*  With white makeup to walk the runway in the fashion that we just discussed the model was quote gender non-conforming [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2984.82s)]
*  He's a dj and a performance artist who goes by lewis g [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2990.98s)]
*  Burton lewis's instagram shows that he is a man who dresses as a woman [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=2994.98s)]
*  But all of this has me wondering whether this is a real fashion pair [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3000.34s)]
*  Why would they call their show fecal matter in french materias ficales I took spanish [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3005.3799999999997s)]

*  If that was your goal you nailed it. That was definitely piece of shit fashion [[00:50:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3017.14s)]
*  but I think instead it's probably just an effort to be as [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3021.46s)]
*  Risqué and push the envelope as possible so that you can be [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3026.3199999999997s)]

*  Right up the same alley. Uh, this one was from dutch designer duran latinx [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3036.98s)]

*  This is a freak [[00:51:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3061.22s)]
*  That's why what I say is a freak somebody you would have used to have to pay money to see this in a circle for the listening audience [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3063.22s)]
*  It's a very tall man with pants and it appears to be no shirt though. I'm told it's it's one of those like [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3068.5s)]
*  Beyond and sensory tops that actually is just like mesh. You can see right through it [[00:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3073.94s)]
*  There was something you couldn't have told it was a matched skin tone top creating the illusion. He was topless [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3077.14s)]
*  Um latinx the designer of what again was the designer of what garment? [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3084.66s)]
*  Defended the look to women's wear daily. It's about cosplay. It's playing with bad taste. It's about form [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3089.94s)]
*  Every season we're trying to sort of surprise ourselves with how we can change an original piece into something that we find interesting [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3096.1s)]
*  And we're going to do whatever the fuck we want because we're free [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3102.02s)]
*  Great. You do that. Mr. Latink and we will not buy any of your clothing. Okay [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3106.5s)]
*  Such as it is [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3112.74s)]
*  Um [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3114.74s)]

*  Like the two people who are featured in paris fashion show and then there will be equally cynical [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3121.22s)]
*  Advantage takers like the designers behind this whole thing. The only solution for the rest of us is to say no [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3127.8399999999997s)]
*  Call out the depravity and register how gross we find it. That's all we can do or we're going to lose everything [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3135.3799999999997s)]
*  To these people already our society has devolved to the point where women are running around half naked at public events [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3142.8199999999997s)]

*  It cannot define us and it cannot continue [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3204.98s)]
*  It really can't whether it's some guy dressed as a woman in the u.s. Congress demanding to be called miss. No some guy putting on [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JowtC-1DeLQ&t=3207.06s)]
