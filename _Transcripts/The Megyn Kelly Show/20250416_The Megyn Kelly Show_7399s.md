Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Batya Ungar Sargon, The Free Press columnist, to discuss the breaking news of Letitia James being accused of multiple instances of mortgage fraud, the hypocrisy of how she handled the Trump case, the overall failure of the lawfare efforts against Trump,  Democratic Senators lying on social media about the Abrego Garcia case, Maryland's Senator actually performatively flying to El Salvador over it, how the corporate media is framing him as just a nice Maryland dad, Obama jumping in to support Harvard in its fight with the Trump administration, why Trump is pushing for fairness for and against extremism on college campuses, how the reputation of Ivy League degrees has completely eroded, fake female “astronauts” Lauren Sanchez, Katy Perry, and Gayle King mocked for their ridiculous mission, their out-of-touch perspective praising themselves, even left-wing celebs critiquing them for how it looks, and more. Then attorney Stacey Evans joins to discuss her client, a doctor, who sued NBC News for defamation after calling him a “uterus collector” over supposed hysterectomies of detained illegal immigrants, the truth about the story that even some at NBC knew behind-the-scenes, why they were able to settle based on what was found in discovery over, how the lawyer is a Democratic politician and was disappointed that she had to sue MSNBC but had to do what was right and fair, how discovery showed MSNBC knew that the story about a Georgia doctor being called a “uterus collector” had major red flags and might be false, how they aired it anyway because it appears it was helpful politically to the left, and more.

# Fake Space "Mission" Brutally Mocked, and Defamation Case Against NBC, w/ Ungar-Sargon and Evans
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 16, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. We have so much to get to today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=0.0s)]
*  Later, we've got the lawyer for the doctor who recently settled his massive defamation case [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  against NBC News. She will join me to explain exactly what they did on the Rachel Maddow show, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=9.44s)]
*  the Nicole Wallace show, the Chris Hayes show, and on MSNBC.com with people like Jacob Soboroff [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=15.76s)]
*  that wound up costing NBC some undisclosed amount of money with which the plaintiffs say they are [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  very happy. And the facts of this case are shocking. We'll get to that in just a bit. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=30.4s)]
*  But there's so much news to get to first. There's the latest on the Abrego Garcia case. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  Democrat senators making absolute fools of themselves now going to bat for the illegal [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=42.480000000000004s)]
*  immigrant suspected MS-13 gang member. This is their poster boy on the left now who was sent [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=46.64s)]
*  to El Salvador. He's El Salvadorian. Okay. There was the removal order saying don't remove him [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=51.6s)]
*  there because he might face gang violence. That gang has since evaporated. They've been extinguished. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=57.36s)]
*  So the danger's gone. What we did was send him back to his home country. It's not like a gift. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=62.88s)]
*  I realize he's sitting in a prison. That's going to be El Salvador's problem. Right now it is [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=67.28s)]
*  a showdown, legal showdown between the Trump administration and this judge. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=73.12s)]
*  But really as a practical matter, we sent an El Salvadorian back to his country. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=77.12s)]
*  And the ladies of the Blue Origins mission, the space mission, literally they're talking about it [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=81.36s)]
*  like it was Apollo 11. They think they're Neil Armstrong. It's amazing. They are getting ripped [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=87.28s)]
*  now, not just from the Megyn Kelly's of the world, but from all these lefties. All these Hollywood [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=93.92s)]
*  celebs are going on instrument and elsewhere and expressing their disdain for what these women did [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=100.4s)]
*  and how they're celebrating themselves. Wait until you hear how they talked about their [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=108.88s)]
*  10 minute trip on Jeff Bezos' sexual fantasy rocket. A lot to get to. Joining me now at Batya [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=116.88s)]
*  Angar Sargon, free press columnist and author of Second Class, How the Elites Betrayed America's [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=124.24000000000001s)]

*  the IRS is ramping up enforcement and every day you wait might make things worse. With over 5,000 [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=146.88000000000002s)]
*  new tax liens filed daily and tools like property seizures, bank levies and wage garnishments, [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  you don't want to mess around. Okay. The good news is there's still time for Tax Network USA to help. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=158.48000000000002s)]

*  haven't run out of options. Let Tax Network USA help before the IRS makes the next move. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=192.23999999999998s)]
*  Roger, great to see you. Great. Thank you so much for being here. Thank you so much for having me, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=199.35999999999999s)]
*  Megan. It's always such a gift to be able to join you and your listeners. Oh, I love you. I feel [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=203.44s)]
*  exactly the same way when you're on. All right. We've got to start with Letitia James because I'm [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=208.64s)]
*  sorry, but this is a huge deal. Letitia James, attorney general of the state of New York, [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=215.04s)]
*  may be on the wrong end of the law herself. This is all over the news right now. The allegations [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=222.72s)]
*  first reported by the outlet White Collar Fraud, Fox News bringing them on the air last night. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=230.16s)]
*  On Tuesday, she was hit with a federal criminal referral for instances of alleged mortgage fraud. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=236.24s)]
*  The federal housing finance agency director William Pulte sent a letter to AG Pam Bondi [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=244.16s)]
*  and her deputy AG Todd Blanch accusing Letitia James of mortgage fraud, quote, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=251.84s)]
*  in the course of exercising US federal housing authorities under Federal Housing Enterprises [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=257.04s)]
*  Financial Safety and Soundness Act, US federal housing has identified matters that are appropriate [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=262.24s)]
*  for referral to the US DOJ for the consideration of criminal prosecution. The bottom line is, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=266.56s)]
*  they're alleging that she got a second house in Virginia. She's obviously, she lives in New York. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=274.08s)]
*  She's the New York attorney general. She has to live in New York. She got a second house in [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=279.68s)]
*  Virginia and then in applying for a mortgage for that house, she had a lawyer to whom she designated [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=283.76s)]
*  power of attorney declare that it was her principal residence. They allege that she did that because [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  you get a better mortgage rate when you say it's your principal residence because banks think if [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=295.36s)]
*  you're going to default on a mortgage, it's not going to be the one of the house in which you live. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=301.52s)]
*  So if you fall in hard times, you're more likely to default on a second mortgage like a beach home [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=306.0s)]
*  or a secondary thing than your primary and that she, knowing that this was not her primary residence, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=310.0s)]
*  obviously she's in New York and she has to be, lied and that you can't, having your power of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  attorney lie is the same as you lying. There's absolutely no distinction legally. So they're [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=323.04s)]
*  saying she did that. Then they're saying she had a place in Brooklyn that she was going to get a [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=327.92s)]
*  special mortgage for as long as it has had four apartments or bedrooms or less. You could get a [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=333.04s)]
*  lower rate if you had four bedrooms or under. I can't figure out whether it was like one of those [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  townhomes where everybody has their own apartment or whether it's a dwelling that has actual bedrooms [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=345.84000000000003s)]
*  for a family, but it's irrelevant. The point is you get a better mortgage rate if it's got four [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=350.72s)]
*  bedrooms or less and this place had five and they're alleging that she wrongfully declared it had [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=355.92s)]
*  four over and over once again to get a more favorable mortgage rate. And then on top of all [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=360.8s)]
*  that, and this is truly bizarre, they are alleging that a long time ago when I don't, she must, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=367.92s)]
*  I don't know how old she was, but it was 1983. They're alleging that she and her father [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=376.56s)]
*  signed mortgage documents that stated they were husband and wife in order to secure a home [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=386.08s)]
*  mortgage. And then again, on May 4th, 2000, Ms. James was listed with her husband as husband and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=392.56s)]
*  wife. And alleging that while this was a long time ago, it raises serious concerns about the validity [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=402.0s)]
*  of her representations on mortgage applications. This is an earthquake. This woman [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=408.15999999999997s)]
*  devoted years of her life in the past five years to bringing down Donald Trump [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=415.91999999999996s)]
*  for what? For alleged misrepresentations to banks about the value of his properties. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=423.2s)]
*  The allegation was so that he could secure more favorable loans than he was entitled to. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=432.24s)]
*  In a different dressing, it's the same general fashion as what she's being accused of herself. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=438.56s)]
*  But yeah, now she hasn't spoken to it directly, but her spokesperson said she's focused every [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=448.32s)]
*  single day on protecting New Yorkers, especially as this administration weaponizes, that's rich, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=454.24s)]
*  as this administration weaponizes the federal government against the rule of law and the [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=458.56s)]
*  constitution. She will not be intimidated by bullies no matter who they are. But this is [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=461.92s)]
*  unbelievable. And if one word of this is true, she is in a world of trouble right now. Your thoughts? [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=467.44s)]
*  It's so amazing because I always say Donald Trump has a real genius for bringing out the lowest [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=477.92s)]
*  qualities in his opponents. You look at how the Democrats have turned on all of their own values [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=486.24s)]
*  the minute they suspected Trump of supporting them, whether it was standing up for the working [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=493.36s)]
*  class or standing up for free speech or standing up for women, as you point out all the time, [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=498.72s)]
*  Megan, they simply will not ever cease or hesitate to retreat from their own values if they think [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=504.40000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump may be representing them. But here we have something even more delicious, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=511.76s)]
*  which is that it was revealed that the person attacking him for all of these trumped up [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=516.8s)]
*  ridiculous charges who went after him for the pure sake of going after the political rival [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=523.6800000000001s)]
*  of the Democrats because he was more popular than the Democrats, that she was herself allegedly [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=530.4s)]
*  engaged in the very things that she was pretending he was doing, which he was not actually doing. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=536.4s)]
*  It is just chef's kiss, Megan, because it is such a parallel for the Democrats who accused Donald [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=543.68s)]
*  Trump of being a threat to democracy while themselves undermining democracy. They accuse him [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=550.48s)]
*  of weaponizing the law while themselves weaponizing the law. And this is just like such a beautiful, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=556.56s)]
*  perfect bow on top of the box of their hypocrisy where he again and again comes out ahead. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=564.3199999999999s)]
*  It's incredible. She's going to be hoisted on her own petard because she's spent the past three [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=572.8s)]
*  years, four years arguing about how no one is above the law. The powerful must be treated the same as [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=582.4s)]
*  the poor, that just because you're rich and famous doesn't give you the right to manipulate [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=590.16s)]
*  the banking system to get more favorable loans. Oh my God. All of that is going to be shoved [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=595.04s)]
*  right down her throat and into her craw in the context of this investigation and this case. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=601.92s)]
*  Now she'll tell us what her defense is. I'm all ears. Cannot wait to hear how she's had alleged [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=608.0799999999999s)]
*  repeated slip ups on her mortgages. One you could understand. I don't know. Maybe the dwelling that [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=615.44s)]
*  she said is four bedrooms instead of five. Maybe they did something with the fifth bedroom. She's [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=622.32s)]
*  counting as a study, although that's not the way it works. On a mortgage law, they want to know [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=628.4000000000001s)]
*  what qualifies as a bedroom. They don't care how you're using it. I'm just trying to look for ways [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=632.08s)]
*  to give her the benefit of the doubt. I'm not sure how you say your father is your husband. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=635.9200000000001s)]
*  That's a tough one. It's not exactly what she's being prosecuted for, but if true, [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=640.56s)]
*  it absolutely shows a pattern of dishonesty. And by the way, pattern evidence can get in [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=646.0s)]
*  in criminal trials. They've been using it against Harvey Weinstein and others up and down Letitia [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=653.12s)]
*  James's New York state criminal system. So this woman's in a lot of trouble today. I'm telling [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=658.88s)]
*  you this is serious. Having read the complaint, Jonathan Turley was on Fox last night and he said [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=666.24s)]
*  exactly this. It took me less than a minute to find cases prosecuted under this statute [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=671.36s)]
*  for false claims of principal residences and the other allegations. So this is not some unusual [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=676.48s)]
*  statute that they bring up from time to time for enemies. This is actually quite frequently enforced [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=681.2s)]
*  and says, this woman previously prosecuted Trump for everything short of ripping a label off a [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=686.88s)]
*  mattress. She emphasized he was ultimately responsible for any filings made in his name [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=691.6s)]
*  or that of his company, irrespective of whether he had seen them or signed them personally. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=696.88s)]
*  He authorized them just as she would have here. And he said the greatest danger for Letitia James [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=702.88s)]
*  may be if the Letitia James standard is applied to her, where she emphasized such technicalities [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=709.36s)]
*  matter and that the powerful should not be given a free pass. This is just unbelievable. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=715.2s)]
*  I mean, Fannie Willis goes down because she couldn't keep her zipper up long enough to [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=721.76s)]
*  actually see the prosecution of Donald Trump through. And then I believe she lied under oath [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=727.9200000000001s)]
*  very clearly to me, as well as her paramour, Nathan Waite. So that case crumbled. It crumbled, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=733.76s)]
*  even though it was a state case. He couldn't be pardoned. There were all sorts of reasons why that [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=740.48s)]
*  one was problematic. But to your point, his enemies are just the worst people. Then Jack Smith loses [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=745.2s)]
*  the Florida case before Trump even won because he was the wrong prosecutor. They held that the [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=752.0s)]
*  appointment of this particular prosecutor was wrong. The J-6 case was all but gutted by the [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=757.36s)]
*  Supreme Court saying he's got presidential immunity for most of this. The only one who got Trump was [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=762.24s)]
*  Alvin Bragg. And even that case was really undermined by that presidential immunity finding [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=767.76s)]
*  and ultimately kind of crumbled at the very end, even though Alvin Bragg was determined to see it [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=773.4399999999999s)]
*  through so he could call Trump a convicted felon. And I think it'll be reversed on appeal. So what [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=778.64s)]
*  do you have now? You do have the E. Jean Carroll verdict, which we all know is bullshit. And then [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=783.04s)]
*  there's this case by Letitia James, which was the one I was told by Trump insiders was the one that [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=788.16s)]
*  bothered him the most all along. It's his company, his near and dear company. And what's being [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=792.64s)]
*  alleged in this lawsuit is that that case was pursued by an alleged fraudster herself. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=797.6s)]
*  Yeah. And if this is true, I mean, Megan, if you had done this stuff, right, like the stuff she's [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=805.52s)]
*  accused of doing, you might sort of hesitate before going out and having the most high profile person [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=811.4399999999999s)]
*  on planet Earth be accused by you of the same exact things. So you have to like understand here, [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=818.64s)]
*  how is it possible that she could have staked so much knowing that she had done the same thing if [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=825.36s)]
*  this is all true? And I think the answer to that is really important. Democrats fundamentally do not [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=831.52s)]
*  consider conservatives and Republicans to be human in the same way that they are. They don't see them [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=837.76s)]
*  as comparable. And the confidence with which she used the justice system to go after Trump [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=843.68s)]
*  for the very crimes that she herself is alleged of having committed suggests to me this kind of [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=851.5999999999999s)]
*  confidence that the system will always work not justly, but in their favor. Right. There's a kind [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=858.0799999999999s)]
*  of unconscious acknowledgement here and admission, if you will, that they believe that they are not [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=866.4s)]
*  held to the same standard as conservatives and Republicans and certainly Donald Trump. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=874.72s)]
*  And I think for me, that's what's really interesting about this. Oh, she was like out there with the red [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=880.3199999999999s)]
*  drape, you know, tempting the bull. Who could forget the many times we heard this from her in [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=887.12s)]
*  South three. I will never be afraid to challenge this illegitimate president when our fundamental [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=893.44s)]
*  rights are at stake. I believe that the president of these United States can be indicted for criminal [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=899.44s)]
*  offenses. Oh, we're going to be a real pain in the. I know my name personally, that man in the White House [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=904.6400000000001s)]
*  who can't go a day without threatening our fundamental rights. Yes, we need to focus on [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=917.2s)]
*  Donald Trump and his abuses. We need to follow his money. We need to find out where he's laundered [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=923.12s)]
*  money. We need to find out whether or not he's engaged in conspiracy. It's important that everyone [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=928.96s)]
*  understand that the days of Donald Trump are coming to an end. I look forward to going into the office [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=933.76s)]
*  of attorney general every day, suing him, defending your rights and then going home. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=938.96s)]
*  That's a Fox News, but it's unbelievable. Right. By the way, just pro tip, Letitia James, [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=947.6800000000001s)]
*  your father is not your husband unless you've done something very wrong. And so is he. That's just, [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=953.1999999999999s)]
*  just as a starter. And also when you apply for mortgages, you have to be truthful. I did look it [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=957.92s)]
*  up. It's a five family dwelling. So there's no ambiguity. It's a five family dwelling that, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=962.4s)]
*  according to this guy, this, the guy I just referenced, hold on, I'll make sure I get his [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=968.48s)]
*  title correct. Director William Poulty of the federal housing finance agency. He says that she, [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=974.48s)]
*  she declared that it was four units because a building that exceeds four units, that's [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=982.5600000000001s)]
*  greater than four, that's five like hers, must be treated as a multifamily property and typically [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=988.4s)]
*  has larger down payment requirements and higher interest rate terms. And he said it appears that [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=992.8000000000001s)]
*  quote, Ms. James may have listed the Brooklyn, New York property as four units instead of five [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=998.0s)]
*  in order to meet the conforming loan requirements and thus receive better interest rates. Ms. James [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1001.9200000000001s)]
*  also appears to have used the same falsification in order to receive mortgage assistance through [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1006.8000000000001s)]
*  this federal program, which he abbreviates here. So like I said, the red cape Batya, and guess what? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1011.52s)]
*  The bull has come running. I mean, this isn't yet on Trump. This is, I have no idea whether Mr. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1020.16s)]
*  Poulty had any, I don't know how he got started on this, no idea, but he's now referring it to [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1027.2s)]
*  Pam Bondi saying, you should prosecute this. This is a very serious matter. And I have a feeling [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1033.04s)]
*  Pam Bondi will feel the same. And of course, the Democrats are going to [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1040.0800000000002s)]
*  accuse the Trump administration of weaponization and so forth, right? Because that's their favorite [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1045.68s)]
*  thing to do, which is, you know, as we've said many times on this show, every accusation from [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1050.0800000000002s)]
*  them is really a confession. If it wasn't clear before how much they believe that they have the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1054.64s)]
*  right to use the institutions of this country, whether it's the justice system or the university [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1061.8400000000001s)]
*  system or our economy in order to further their own political gains, to seize power and to line [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1067.92s)]
*  their pockets with the proceeds, this really is the cherry on the cake of that. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1075.1200000000001s)]
*  It's unbelievable. Like you got to be squeaky clean when you are a prosecutor or an attorney [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1080.16s)]
*  general. And I'm sorry, this isn't 2020 hindsight. This is everybody knows that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1088.8000000000002s)]
*  Everybody knows that just even while I was practicing law as a civilian, I wasn't in a [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1094.0800000000002s)]
*  government role. I knew that I knew I had to be super careful on every tax return. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1098.72s)]
*  Just I felt as an officer of the court, I was held to a higher standard. And I took it seriously. [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1105.04s)]
*  And I was honored to do it. I felt like I was sworn into the to the bar. I had to take an [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1110.64s)]
*  ethical test and pass that separately to convince these people to let me represent people in court [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1115.68s)]
*  and uphold my word as an officer of a court and dealing with judges and so on. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1122.08s)]
*  All those same things apply to her and then some because she's actually got criminal indictment [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1128.24s)]
*  power. She can put people behind bars or she can devastate their businesses. So being above [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1134.32s)]
*  reproach is especially important for someone like Letitia James. And this I'm not going to comment [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1140.32s)]
*  thing, this breezing back pass the reporters or she was on a fake phone call this morning, [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1146.08s)]
*  ain't gonna cut it. She's finding out that's what's happening right now. [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1150.8s)]
*  She made up a fake crime to go after Donald Trump with was a civil suit, but she made up a fake [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1156.3999999999999s)]
*  legal indictment against him where she sued him to within an inch of his net worth and tried to ruin [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1164.96s)]
*  his business and actually is on her way toward doing it. Although she's going to get reversed. [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1171.12s)]
*  And you know what? You really do need to have clean hands if you're going to play that kind of [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1176.48s)]
*  game. Letitia James, we'll see how it goes for you. Okay. Speaking of unclean hands, [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1181.12s)]
*  the case of a Abrego Garcia, this guy, wait until you hear what we've just found out about this guy. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1186.48s)]
*  He's the left poster boy, favorite poster boy child for just a Maryland dad who president Trump [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1191.9199999999998s)]
*  picked on. He just picked him up for no good reason and shipped him off to that El Salvador [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1198.8s)]
*  prison. Well, one of the things they're trying to do, and this audience, we've talked to many [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1203.68s)]
*  times, but he's not just a Maryland dad. He's not a US citizen. He's from El Salvador. He was picked [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1208.8s)]
*  up and he was brought here illegally by his parents when he was 16. In 2019, he was arrested [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1214.24s)]
*  for suspected gang activity. And in the context of investigating this guy, they figured out that he [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1219.52s)]
*  was an illegal and he was ordered removed. A district court judge, an immigration trial judge, [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1223.8400000000001s)]
*  and then an appellate court above her both agreed he needed to be removed. He pled for mercy saying, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1229.28s)]
*  please, you can't send me back to El Salvador because there's gang activity. They might want [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1234.48s)]
*  to kill me. And they said, okay, you don't have to go back to El Salvador. And he's been kind of just [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1237.52s)]
*  like hovering here ever since on our benevolence and saying, you know, you're kickoutable, but we [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1240.96s)]
*  won't send you back there. Anyway, that's where things stand with him. And in order to soften [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1247.76s)]
*  the hearts, probably of American women in particular, but Americans cross country, [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1252.8799999999999s)]
*  they've been parading out his mother and his wife. He's a good husband. He's a great father. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1257.68s)]
*  I'm going to read you some of what she's said. Um, saying, let's see. We have a thought. Okay, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1264.4s)]
*  nevermind. We cut a thought. Watch it. The Trump administration has labeled him a human [[00:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1272.3200000000002s)]
*  trafficker, even an MS-13 gang leader. How do you respond to those claims? [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1276.0800000000002s)]
*  So everything they're saying, it's wrong. My husband is a loving father. And what I know is [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1280.5600000000002s)]
*  he's an amazing husband, an amazing father. That's who he truly is. [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1287.04s)]
*  Okay. Amazing husband and father. Now this just broke today. Andy Ngo, who's been on this show [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1294.08s)]
*  many times, um, Andy Ngo first reported this and then it was picked up by Bill Mollusion of Fox. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1300.56s)]
*  And now has been verified by Bill Mollusion of Fox based on Maryland state records. This great [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1306.8799999999999s)]
*  husband, this wonderful father, not once, but more than once has been accused of domestic violence [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1312.32s)]
*  by that woman who was giving that interview right there. And the court records have been pulled. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1322.3999999999999s)]
*  There's one from 2020. The case is now closed. There's another one from 2021. The case is now [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1327.6s)]
*  closed. Um, and she signed this under penalty of perjury. [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1333.6s)]
*  Yeah. In connection with his deportation from the moment he was detained, my children and I were [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1340.6399999999999s)]
*  sad and worried. He's always been a loving, reliable partner and father. We struggled without him [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1345.36s)]
*  emotionally and economically. That loving partner accused repeatedly of domestic violence against [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1351.12s)]
*  this spouse. And we don't yet have the details, but I guarantee you we're going to get them. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1358.48s)]
*  And what that does, Batia is it undermines this woman's credibility entirely. She, at least two [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1365.12s)]
*  that we've found so far, records of alleged domestic violence. How did we find that out? [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1374.24s)]
*  From her undoubtedly. Um, this is not some sweetheart, like loving kid who the Trump [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1379.68s)]
*  administration is just picking on. This guy was found by two courts to have ties to MSM, [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1386.56s)]
*  MS 13 to be in MS 13. And now we see an accused serial domestic abuser. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1391.6s)]
*  One of the horrific things about Biden's open border policy and in general, the, you know, [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1400.3999999999999s)]
*  handshake agreement between both parties until Trump showed up that we should have masses of [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1407.04s)]
*  illegal immigrants coming into this country is that in the name of some sort of compassion for [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1411.84s)]
*  the global indigent, um, we should bring these people in. What actually happened, which Trump [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1418.08s)]
*  understands intuitively somehow is that we have incentivized immense amounts of cruelty. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1424.6399999999999s)]
*  And we've done that to our own citizens in the form of plunging wages, because suddenly there's [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1432.08s)]
*  a lot of competition for jobs. And we've done it in the form of cruelty to the people crossing [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1438.0s)]
*  the Darien gap. A third of the women who do so admit to being raped. So you can imagine what the [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1443.6s)]
*  actual number is. Those people become enslaved to the cartels once they get here. And because of the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1450.32s)]
*  threat of deportation for something like domestic violence, women do not report it when an illegal [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1457.12s)]
*  migrant husband beats the crap out of them. Because what's supposed to happen when you commit [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1464.16s)]
*  a vicious crime like that is you're supposed to get deported. So the fact that this woman actually [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1470.24s)]
*  twice seems to have gone to the authorities about the domestic abuse she was suffering at the hands [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1476.64s)]
*  of her husband, that's not actually the norm because many women don't do that because they [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1482.88s)]
*  would rather suffer it than see their husband deported. Now the question is, why was he not [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1489.28s)]
*  deported for the two times that he beat the crap out of his wife? I would like to know. I mean, [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1494.32s)]
*  there was so much that went wrong here, allegedly, so much that went wrong here. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1500.0s)]
*  Megan, I read that the stay of deportation was not just that he would get killed by a rival gang, [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1506.08s)]
*  but the word rival being crucial there, right? That was part of the proof that he was an MS-13, [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1513.04s)]
*  right? So he was allowed to stay on the grounds that he belonged to a gang. I mean, the immigration [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1519.92s)]
*  system, the court system is so messed up here. And the Democrats are acting like because these [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1528.3999999999999s)]
*  activists in the system from the lawyers to the judges shirked their responsibility. Therefore, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1536.24s)]
*  Trump is at fault for carrying it out. And I just have to say, Megan, I hope the Democrats [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1545.6000000000001s)]
*  keep white knighting for Hamas defenders and for people who beat up their wives, for people who [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1553.44s)]
*  belonged to gangs, to illegal immigrants, because this is a losing issue and they don't know it, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1561.2s)]
*  because their base is the top 20% who loves this stuff, right? They cannot see that the majority of [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1569.3600000000001s)]
*  people in America, this just is not going to bother them because this person is not a good person and [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1579.2s)]
*  they don't want him for a neighbor. Now, if you turn on any of the liberal channels, you'll see [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1587.44s)]
*  the elites sitting there saying, well, maybe I don't want him for a neighbor, but we should [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1592.48s)]
*  adjudicate that in a court. That's because he'll never be your neighbor. He'll be some working [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1597.76s)]
*  class Americans neighbor whose children have to play with his kids who know that their mom is [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1603.92s)]
*  being beat up by their dad, allegedly. We'll see what the details are there. And it's just so [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1610.0800000000002s)]
*  disgusting the elitism here. You have United States senators getting on planes to white knight [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1615.84s)]
*  for this person. Let's talk about that. Let me show that. So Senator Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1624.6399999999999s)]
*  which is, you know, he's just a Maryland dad. That's all just a sweet Maryland dad that Trump's [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1630.08s)]
*  picking on. He decided to go to El Salvador. I can't wait to see how this works out, frankly. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1633.36s)]
*  And he thinks he's going to storm the prison, I guess, and like do firsthand reporting on it. [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1641.12s)]
*  Good luck with that, sir. Take your chances because I don't think you want to mess around [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1645.52s)]
*  with President Bukele. Here he is posting a video from the airport explaining the trip. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1649.2s)]
*  I'm here at the airport. I'm about to board my flight for San Salvador. The goal of this mission [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1654.16s)]
*  is to let the Trump administration to mention government of El Salvador know that we are going [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1659.76s)]
*  to keep fighting to bring a Briego Garcia home until he returns to his family. I hope to meet with [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1665.68s)]
*  representatives of the government. I hope to have the chance to actually see Gilmour and see [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1674.32s)]
*  what his condition is. But we are going to keep fighting because this is a miscarriage of justice. [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1680.08s)]
*  This is about due process. This is about rule of law. What bullies do is they begin by picking on [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1685.6799999999998s)]
*  the most vulnerable. But if we get rid of their law due process, the United States, it's a short [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1691.9199999999998s)]
*  road from there to tyranny. Yeah, like their wives. That is what bullies do. They pick on the most [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1697.76s)]
*  vulnerable. And sometimes they have repeated instances of beating the shit out of the person [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1704.96s)]
*  they're supposed to love most. I don't know whether a Briego Garcia did that in this case, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1710.4s)]
*  but I'm looking at two Maryland court records in which his wife, I don't know if they were married [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1715.04s)]
*  at the time, but the same woman, Jennifer Vasquez, that he's with now filed for a protective order [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1720.24s)]
*  against him for domestic violence. He's not the only one. I'll give you one more and I'll give you [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1726.0s)]
*  the floor. Senator Chris Murphy from my new adopted home state of Connecticut, never now to miss an [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1730.88s)]
*  opportunity to put himself in front of a camera now that he's sleeping with some hack PR person. [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1735.68s)]
*  This is him weighing in. This is the constitutional crisis. It's the confrontation between the court [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1742.16s)]
*  saying that the president has to bring a Briego Garcia back home and Trump refusing to do it. [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1748.8s)]
*  Why should this matter to you? Because if the president has the power to jail and prison, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1754.96s)]
*  to deport anyone, even if they have a legal right to be here as a citizen or through protected status [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1760.24s)]
*  given by the courts, then none of us are safe. Today, it's this El Salvadorian immigrant, but [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1768.0s)]
*  tomorrow it could be you or me. This matters. This matters. This is the one power that we cannot give [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1774.1599999999999s)]
*  the president of the United States the ability to take any of us off the street and imprison us [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1782.48s)]
*  just because the president believes he has the power, a power that he does not have. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1788.88s)]
*  Okay, so I just want to say one thing to you in tossing this. That man is so disrespectful [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1795.44s)]
*  because what he's really assuming and projecting there is that he thinks people are idiots. He's [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1801.1200000000001s)]
*  taking advantage of people who have to work all day to put food on the table and manage their [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1807.6s)]
*  children and their busy lives who do not have eight to 10 hours a day to research the news [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1813.6s)]
*  and figure out where Chris Murphy is lying to them. And the suggestion in any way, shape or form that [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1818.9599999999998s)]
*  an American has been grabbed, arrested, and shipped off to El Salvador is a lie. And he's banking on [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1826.0s)]
*  them just not having that intimate a connection with the details of the story like this, [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1835.68s)]
*  Merrill and dad, to know he's lying to them as he tries to scare them. In a court of law, [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1841.2s)]
*  an objection would have been sustained. The entire commentary would have been stricken [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1847.92s)]
*  and he would have been admonished by the judge not to actively mislead the jury. [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1852.16s)]
*  You're exactly right. Of course, there is no slippery slope between a non-citizen who committed [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1857.76s)]
*  a felony and entering this country and a citizen of the United States. The only people trying to [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1864.08s)]
*  make a slippery slope between citizens and non-citizens are the Democrats because that [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1870.1599999999999s)]
*  has been their agenda for the last 40 years. They are the ones who want there to be no legal [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1875.28s)]
*  difference. They want an open border. They want an endless supply of slave labor to watch their [[00:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1881.76s)]
*  children and clean their homes and do their landscaping and work in the fields and pick [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1887.9199999999998s)]
*  the crops as Nancy Pelosi famously put it. They are the ones. This is their wishful thinking [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1892.48s)]
*  that there would be a slippery slope between a citizen and a non-citizen. [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1898.08s)]
*  Average Americans know that being an American citizen, indeed being allowed to live legally [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1902.56s)]
*  on United States soil is the greatest privilege on planet earth. And that you can't just decide [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1908.24s)]
*  that there's going to be a slippery slope there. No, there is a legal distinction upon which every [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1915.3600000000001s)]
*  single one of our civil rights rests that there is a difference between being an American and [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1921.28s)]
*  being a non-American. Now, why do the Democrats insist so strongly that there should be a slippery [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1927.6s)]
*  slope there? Not just that there is, but that they want there to be one. Why are they insisting [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1934.08s)]
*  that in Donald Trump enforcing the law and doing what he promised the American people and getting [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1939.2s)]
*  rid of violent non-citizens, that this somehow threatens Americans? Why do they insist that in [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1946.16s)]
*  deporting a green card holder who lied on his green card and supports Hamas and supports ending [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1952.4s)]

*  That's Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1961.6000000000001s)]
*  Mahmoud Khalil. [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1962.64s)]
*  Just to keep it straight, that's a separate case, the guy out of Columbia. Keep going. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1964.16s)]
*  Exactly. Their entire agenda right now is cosplaying. Their base are the top 10%, the top 20%, [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1966.96s)]
*  the people who show up at Coachella to hear Bernie Sanders speak, the people who show up to hear AOC [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1975.44s)]
*  speak. These are wealthy people. They are in the top 10%, which controls over 60% of the wealth [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1981.6000000000001s)]
*  in this country. They don't have real problems. And so what they do is they have to look for [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1987.68s)]
*  other people's problems to pretend that they have. We talked about this during the election. This is [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=1995.1200000000001s)]
*  why wealthy, middle-aged, Democratic women made third trimester abortions their number one issue. [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2000.88s)]
*  It's because it allows them to cosplay as the oppressed. They know at some level that they are [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2009.1200000000001s)]
*  unbelievably privileged. And they know because they can see the polls that Donald Trump has made [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2015.1200000000001s)]
*  the case to working-class Americans of all races, that he has their best interests at heart, that he [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2020.4s)]

*  what immigration is about. That's what getting trans women out of women's sports is about. It's [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2031.0400000000002s)]
*  about the dignity of the average American. And the Democrats, in realizing that they have lost touch [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2036.5600000000002s)]
*  with that great American middle, have to invent ways in which they are the ones who are on the side [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2043.6000000000001s)]
*  of the oppressed. Hence the magical slippery slope that if Donald Trump supports an alleged wife [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2050.56s)]
*  beater or somebody who supports Hamas, people who are not American citizens and don't have the rights [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2057.7599999999998s)]
*  of American citizens, that he could be coming for you, you wealthy people at Coachella. You are a [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2064.0s)]
*  potential victim. Your rights are being oppressed. You are the real victim here. That's what they're [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  trying to do here. And of course, it's going to fall flat. It's going to work with the top 10% [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2077.52s)]
*  because that's really what they want to hear, that they are the true oppressed. But this is going to [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2082.32s)]
*  get the Democrats nowhere. There's a meme I keep thinking about, this anime meme of the young man [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2086.16s)]
*  standing like this and there's a butterfly. It's like he's the Democrats and they're looking at [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2092.24s)]
*  these ne'er-do-wells, these illegals who came here illegally, broke the law, and they are standing [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2098.88s)]
*  for them. And I just keep thinking, this is them being like, is this how we get back the working [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2105.52s)]
*  class? No, it's not how you get back the working class. 73% of men who voted for Trump, people of [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2110.08s)]
*  color, this is from Ryan Gierdurski, he's great on the polls. He found that 73% of non-white men who [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2118.8s)]
*  voted for Trump want to see radically less immigration. And it's because it comes at their [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2126.96s)]
*  expense, their American dream was put on hold so that the Democrats could walk around white knighting [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2133.44s)]
*  for illegal migrants and they've had enough of it. And that number, Megan, is growing and growing and [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2139.84s)]
*  growing. I mean, I care about the working class and I want them to have better job prospects, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2145.44s)]
*  but I also care about the safety of young women like Laken Reilly, like this 37-year-old mom, [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2150.8s)]
*  Rachel Moran, who was killed on a jog, mother of five by an illegal who was harboring there, [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2157.68s)]
*  who raped her and beat her to death. And Caroline Levitt was making this point perfectly the other [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2164.3999999999996s)]
*  day at the White House, I think it was yesterday, about how they're very, very concerned about [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2171.68s)]
*  Abrego Garcia getting his proper due process. They don't say one word, not one word about the [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2176.48s)]
*  Laken Reillys or the Rachel Moran's of the world. Here she is. [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2184.24s)]
*  The Democrat and media outrage over the deportation of Abrego Garcia, an MS-13 [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2187.4399999999996s)]
*  El Salvadorian, illegal alien criminal who is hiding in Maryland has been nothing short of [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2193.2s)]
*  despicable. Based on the sensationalism of many of the people in this room, you would think we [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2198.56s)]
*  deported a candidate for Father of the Year. That's because unfortunately many in this country care [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2203.68s)]
*  more about this quote unquote Maryland father, illegal alien MS-13 gang member than a Maryland [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2209.52s)]
*  mother and an American citizen who was brutally murdered at the hands of a different illegal alien. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2215.92s)]
*  Of course, I am referring to Rachel Moran. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2221.92s)]
*  Where was the Maryland senator's trip on her behalf, showboating on her behalf? Where was [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2227.12s)]
*  Chris Murphy speaking out so that we all understood the dangers of Joe Biden's illegal [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2234.08s)]
*  immigration policy, that actual American women were being killed as they go for a jog to try [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2239.7599999999998s)]
*  to stay fit? I don't remember them making a deal out of those. And is that because, what, bigotry [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2247.44s)]
*  of low expectations? They just expect these guys are, you know, they're animals. They're going to [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2253.44s)]
*  kill. If so, why would you, why would you want an open border? Right? It's like none of it is [[00:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2259.2s)]
*  congruous other than they see in a story, as you point out, and they see an opportunity to advance [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2264.16s)]
*  themselves. Oh, I could not agree with you more. I mean, these people at this point, they would give [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2271.04s)]
*  a kidney to get a retweet from AOC, you know, like that this is, they've decided this is the direction [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2277.12s)]
*  that the party is going in. I actually like her. I think that she's very genuine and really believes [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2282.3199999999997s)]
*  what she has to say. If the Democrats cannot figure out that illegal immigration is a huge [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2287.2s)]
*  problem that came at the expense of people who used to be their voters and now are Trump's voters, [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2293.3599999999997s)]
*  because he looked at them and said, you have a right to demand better, they're never ever, ever [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2298.8799999999997s)]
*  going to be competitive again. You know, they have a lot of like, you know, they seem to understand [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2304.24s)]
*  that they have a problem. But this is the one thing that they just will not, they can't quit [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2310.16s)]
*  illegal immigrants. And I think, Megan, the reason for that is like, unlike Donald Trump, who very [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2316.96s)]
*  successfully sidelined the elites of his party over the last 10 years, and especially during the [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2322.0s)]
*  last campaign, all of the democratic funding is now bound up with very privileged white progressives [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2326.8799999999997s)]
*  who really support the open border, both for economic and for social reasons, but also, you [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2336.08s)]
*  know, the Soros Foundation, the Ford Foundation, all of these NGOs that have a very, very open [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2341.7599999999998s)]
*  borders mentality, they don't believe borders are real, they don't believe in nation states, they [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2349.84s)]
*  don't believe in national borders. And of course, this is the most elite thing possible. There are [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2354.4s)]
*  millions of Americans who the only thing they have in their life that gives them pride is their [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2360.24s)]
*  American identity. They are proud to belong to this, the greatest nation on planet Earth. [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2366.7999999999997s)]
*  And that is the thing that the elites cannot stand for them to have that they want to rob them of. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2373.8399999999997s)]
*  And of course, the way you rob them of that is you dilute it by having an open border and having a [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2380.3199999999997s)]
*  marketplace that welcomes in millions of people to compete with working class people in the [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2384.8799999999997s)]
*  marketplace. It does dilute our rights. The idea that you could have somebody here who is, you know, [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2389.36s)]
*  claiming to have the same legal protections as a citizen is a way of saying the citizenship itself [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2395.52s)]
*  should not count for anything. And I think all good people should say no to that. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2402.6400000000003s)]
*  I have a point that I want to raise with you. But before I get to it, I just want to point out [[00:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2407.92s)]
*  if again, we haven't independently verified these court records, but Andy Noe found them, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2412.48s)]
*  Fox News is reporting them now, at least two, one from 2021 from 2021, in which Jennifer Vasquez is [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2417.36s)]
*  accusing a man who has the same name, Kilmar Abrego Garcia, and it shows his birthday is 1995, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2425.76s)]
*  which is his birthday. I mean, maybe there are two couples that unite Jennifer Vasquez and Kilmar [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2433.6800000000003s)]
*  Abrego Garcia with his same birthdate. I doubt it. We'll find out if we're wrong, we'll correct it. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2440.4s)]
*  So that would have been a 2020 and a 2021 domestic violence incident bad enough to make her go in and [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2447.84s)]
*  seek a protective order against him alleging serious domestic violence. When he was found [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2452.96s)]
*  allegedly engaging in some sort of activity that led them to believe he was arrestable and part of [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2460.7200000000003s)]
*  MS-13 was 2019. He was in there. He was found to be part of this gang, the appellate court in the [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2464.7200000000003s)]
*  immigration system agreed, part of the gang, deportable. And then he pleaded for mercy saying, [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2472.96s)]
*  well, please just don't deport me to El Salvador. They're going to kill me there. Oh, poor me. And [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2478.64s)]
*  of course we said, okay, fine. You don't have to go. So this would have been within months. [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2482.64s)]
*  The first incident would have been within months of us going soft on him, of our courts saying, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2486.96s)]
*  give him a chance. We don't want him to get hurt. We're not going to send him back there. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2494.4s)]
*  And then if this dovetails the way it looks like it does, according to these documents, [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2499.92s)]
*  he was wailing on his wife in 2020 and then again in 2021. And then he gets arrested and sent out [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2504.2400000000002s)]
*  by Trump and it's back to, oh, poor guy. Oh, it's infuriating. But I wanted to get to your [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2510.2400000000002s)]
*  bigger point because it's important about how these judges are trying to take the matter in hand, [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2516.5600000000004s)]
*  that the Democrats are trying to stop the Trump agenda of removing the millions that Joe Biden [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2524.08s)]
*  willingly, happily, purposefully allowed in. On Monday, a federal judge halted the Trump [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2531.12s)]
*  administration's plan to revoke the legal status and work permits of more than half a million [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2540.3199999999997s)]
*  migrants from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela, who we flew here. We flew here [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2548.8s)]
*  under a Biden era, quote, parole program. He flew them in saying, I'll give you legal protection [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2557.52s)]
*  and I will let you work in the United States for two years. And no sooner had he begun that program [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2565.44s)]
*  than they ran into problems. Some data from the program showing evidence of fraud, [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2572.0s)]
*  one review found that at least 3,200 people applied to sponsor immigrants and it's really [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2577.2s)]
*  supposed to be like a direct relationship, but they sponsored over 101,000 immigrants. [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2585.04s)]
*  So it's clearly these government NGOs or dare I say the Catholic church saying, I'll be responsible [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2589.7599999999998s)]
*  for him. I'll be responsible for him. But 3000 people cannot monitor 101,000 as alleged here. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2596.3199999999997s)]
*  The Trump administration looking at this program also alleges that it was very poor vetting. We [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2602.9599999999996s)]
*  have no idea who he allowed in. Almost 3 million of these applications were filed as of last August, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2608.08s)]
*  including 80,000 from aliens living in countries other than those that I listed. So they're not [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2615.3599999999997s)]
*  even supposed to be considered. This is all according to a house judiciary committee report. [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2621.9199999999996s)]
*  And concerns of fraud were so bad that they even led Biden's department of Homeland security [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2627.68s)]
*  to suspend temporarily this program for several weeks last year. Now a judge has said, [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2632.64s)]
*  you can't do it. They have to stay. You might be able to suspend their legal status here, [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2638.88s)]
*  Mr. Trump, if you give them an individual case by case review, which no one got on the way in. [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2645.12s)]
*  But now we want, they just want to tie him up for the next four years with all of this procedural [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2653.7599999999998s)]
*  bullshit. They got flown in summarily and they can be flown out summarily. There's a new sheriff in [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2661.68s)]
*  town, but no, no says this judge. I think they're wrong on the, on the legal merits. John, you were [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2667.36s)]
*  saying yesterday, you made a really good point, which is that this parole program is always [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2673.68s)]
*  at the request of the president and can be revoked at any moment. You're totally right. They just [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2679.2s)]
*  want to keep them in court, keep them from enacting the agenda that the president was put in office [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2683.76s)]
*  to enact by the voters of this country. You know, Megan, I keep thinking if this was 2016, [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2690.4s)]
*  back then the Democrats sort of mass media approach to opposing the Trump administration [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2697.36s)]
*  worked a lot better. Remember the whole like family separation thing, you know, that was in [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2705.6s)]
*  the New York Times and then it was on CNN and MSNBC. And suddenly, you know, the Trump [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2710.56s)]
*  administration had to back off because there was this huge outcry. And I think today we are just in [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2715.12s)]
*  a totally different moment because the voters, the electorate, the American people was able to see [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2720.32s)]
*  what happens when you have somebody like Joe Biden just basically decriminalize illegal border [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2725.84s)]
*  crossing, which is what he did, which is what he promised he was going to do during the campaign. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2731.04s)]
*  And what an absolute mess it made. And the most horrifying part about it is this to me, I mean, [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2734.96s)]
*  obviously the crimes that are committed against American citizens. I agree, they're totally [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2741.04s)]
*  horrifying. But let's remember why Biden did this. It's because American corporations were [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2745.6s)]
*  desperate for workers in the post pandemic labor crunch, and they didn't want to pay American [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2752.2400000000002s)]
*  workers what they were asking for. And so Biden partnered with the cartels to open the border [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2757.6s)]
*  and provide American corporations with slave labor to the tune of millions and millions and [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2764.8s)]
*  millions of illegal immigrants. And when that chaos threatened his reelection campaign, they said, [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2771.2000000000003s)]
*  you know what, we don't actually need the cartels anymore. We're just going to legally start [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2777.1200000000003s)]
*  importing these people to these corporations so they can pay them slave wages and not have to pay [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2781.28s)]
*  Americans more money. I think Biden felt, well, this will bring down inflation. Now, the problem [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2786.8s)]
*  with this is that, you know, we actually should want working class Americans to make a living [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2792.24s)]
*  wage. I mean, that used to be the Democrats view. We have to control immigration because a tight [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2798.72s)]
*  labor market uses the free market in order to raise wages for working class people and give [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2804.64s)]
*  them dignity. And that's why in the seventies, most Americans were middle class, because people [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2811.3599999999997s)]
*  who worked in meatpacking plants and people who were manicurists and people who worked in construction [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2817.68s)]
*  were able to command a living wage. They were able to make a middle class wage working in working [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2824.48s)]
*  class jobs. And now thanks to the Democrats who still have the chutzpah to cosplay as the side of [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2831.68s)]
*  labor, we shipped all these good manufacturing jobs overseas to China to build up their middle class. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2838.7999999999997s)]
*  We imported millions and millions of low wage illegal immigrants to work in the jobs here, [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2844.7999999999997s)]
*  radically reducing the wages that working class people could ask for. And it was Donald Trump, [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2851.2799999999997s)]
*  a Republican, who showed up and said, you do not have to live like this. If you work hard, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2857.2799999999997s)]
*  you shouldn't be poor. So what about the inflation argument? Right? People will say, oh, well, [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2863.4399999999996s)]
*  if we pay working class people a living wage, then all of these goods are going to become [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2867.9199999999996s)]
*  unaffordable. Well, notice that what Donald Trump has done is he took a bunch of very pro worker [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2872.4s)]
*  policies like tariffs and controlling the border to raise the wages of working class people. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2878.48s)]
*  And he has paired them with a host of very pro business things that are coming down the pike. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2884.48s)]
*  We have radical deregulation. We're going to have cheap energy because of drill, baby drill. [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2892.08s)]
*  We have tax cuts coming and he has promised anybody who reshores manufacturing that he [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2898.96s)]
*  will drop their corporate taxes to 15 percent. That combination of being pro business on the [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2903.92s)]
*  one side and pro worker on the other side, this is genius. And this is why the Democrats can't [[00:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2910.6400000000003s)]
*  stand him because they didn't think of this first. Yeah, exactly. Like there's no tax on tips policy. [[00:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2916.2400000000002s)]
*  They came to it too late and tried to steal it as their own, but they haven't been smart enough to [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2921.44s)]
*  do that in the overall sense. March 2025 numbers at the border, lowest crossings in US history, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2925.28s)]
*  thanks to Donald Trump. We have had a 95 percent decrease from March of 2024. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2936.0s)]
*  When it comes to those we have apprehended and yeah, those that we've apprehended. And by the [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2943.52s)]
*  way, in March of 2024, that was right around when Joe Biden actually did try to start making an [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2950.64s)]
*  effort at the southern border because he realized his reelection chances were going to depend on it. [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2955.2s)]
*  In March of 2024, the numbers crossing the border were about 4,500 a day under Joe Biden. Now it's [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2961.3599999999997s)]
*  less than 330 a day for the entire month. It was a hundred and about 40,000 for the month. [[00:49:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2969.7599999999998s)]
*  Under Trump is about 8,300. It's unbelievable. It was stoppable all along just by him. He just [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2977.6s)]
*  didn't have the will. Stand by more with Badja after this quick break. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2986.72s)]
*  There's a lot of talk about government debt, but after four years of inflation, another real crisis [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2992.88s)]
*  is personal debt. Some people are working harder than ever and still drowning in credit card debt [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=2997.2s)]
*  and overdue bills. But there's done with debt. Done with debt has unique escape strategies to help [[00:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3001.36s)]

*  companies with one goal to drastically reduce your bills, eliminate interest and erase penalties. [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3016.24s)]
*  Most clients wind up with more money in their pocket month one, and they don't stop until they [[00:50:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3022.64s)]

*  Judge Boesberg, who thinks that he's the president of the United States. He's the chief district [[00:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3043.6800000000003s)]
*  court judge for the district of Washington, DC, has just found that there's probable cause. He [[00:50:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3049.6s)]
*  says, let me get the language exact. He said he would launch proceedings to determine whether to [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3059.2000000000003s)]
*  hold the Trump administration, its officials in criminal contempt for defying his order, [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3064.88s)]
*  not to remove Venezuelan migrants from America based on the wartime alien enemies act. This is [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3071.36s)]
*  all based. He's drunk on his own power. This is all based on the fact that Trump decided to use the [[00:51:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3077.28s)]
*  alien enemies act, which by the way, the Supreme Court has already implicitly said, okay, that's [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3086.56s)]
*  good. He can't, I mean, we're not going to chastise him on that. And now there'll be further [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3091.92s)]
*  proceedings, but he decided to use it. And the ACLU ran into court before Judge Boesberg because [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3096.48s)]
*  they knew they could get a sympathetic judge. They did not go into Texas where the detainees were [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3104.7200000000003s)]
*  that they were allegedly representing and trying to fight for. That's where they should have gone. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3109.6800000000003s)]
*  That's what the US Supreme Court ultimately held. They went into DC because they knew they could get [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3114.0s)]
*  a judge. They're all like Boesberg. He's a dime a dozen, these leftist activist judges. [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3117.6s)]
*  And they got a ruling from him saying, first of all, he said, no, no plane should take off. Orally, [[00:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3123.52s)]
*  he said, no plane should take off. What? Who are you? Fuck off, Judge Boesberg. This is Marco [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3130.0s)]
*  Rubio's call and President Trump's call on whether the foreign policy of the United States requires [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3135.7599999999998s)]
*  these people to be deported and whether the safety and security of the American people requires that [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3142.48s)]
*  they to be deported. And the commander in chief ruled that they were part of an incursion or an [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3146.24s)]
*  invasion and he had powers to order them out. Judge Boesberg said, no, I'm higher than you are [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3150.8799999999997s)]
*  on the totem pole. No planes can take off. And that was not put in writing. And there is a real [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3156.3999999999996s)]
*  question about whether any sort of temporary restraining order has to be put in writing for [[00:52:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3161.9199999999996s)]
*  it to be valid. It wasn't put in writing until several hours later that day. And at the time [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3165.2s)]
*  it was put in writing, two planes were already in the air and in international airspace and they [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3169.6s)]
*  refused to turn them around. The third plane is really not relevant. It did take off much later [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3174.48s)]
*  from the written order, but it didn't have anybody on it pursuant to the Alien Enemies Act. [[00:52:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3179.12s)]
*  So it's really less relevant. But he's getting ready to hold them in criminal contempt for not [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3183.44s)]
*  turning those planes around as he ordered and I presume not and for allowing them to take off in [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3188.88s)]
*  the first place. And I don't even know, we talked about this with our lawyer panel the other day, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3194.88s)]
*  but I don't know how you hold the president in criminal contempt. What's he going to do? [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3200.4s)]
*  So are we in a world where the Democrats want Abrego Garcia free and Trump jailed? [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3206.96s)]
*  I think we all know the answer to that. [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3211.2799999999997s)]
*  You know what I keep thinking, Megan? I keep thinking, they tried to get him on 91 counts [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3215.12s)]
*  and look at where we are now. Maybe just take a beat. This Khalil Mahmood guy, [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3221.7599999999998s)]
*  they hold him up as some sort of, you know, oh, he's being deported because of his views. This is a [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3229.92s)]
*  free speech issue. And then it turns out if you had just waited like, you know, 10 minutes, you [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3235.04s)]
*  would have found out that this guy actually lied on his visa application, right? This guy, right? [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3240.08s)]
*  This Garcia fellow who they're holding up as this Maryland father. Well, maybe wait a minute and [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3245.68s)]
*  find out, you know, a little bit more about this person before you decide to nominate him for like, [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3251.68s)]
*  you know, the avatar of the Democratic Party. And they just can't seem to understand that there is [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3256.88s)]
*  a real logic here. Donald Trump is not a careful speaker, but everything he has done since he got [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3264.4s)]
*  into office has been unbelievably intentional. You know, they lost in 2020 and they sat at home. [[00:54:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3271.76s)]
*  And for four years, they plotted. I feel like you can really see this with Jason Miller, right? And [[00:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3278.6400000000003s)]
*  with that with Stephen Miller. Steve, this is a guy who sat at home for four years and plotted [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3283.76s)]
*  how he was going to restore America to its greatness through using legal avenues to enact [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3291.28s)]
*  the Trump agenda that is wildly popular with the American people. And that is what they did. And [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3298.6400000000003s)]
*  that is what they are doing. And the Democrats are acting like it's 2016. People are shooting from [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3303.5200000000004s)]
*  the hip and that you can get a story in the New York Times and shut down the agenda. And we are [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3309.04s)]
*  just in a totally different moment. I think Trump was really changed by the assassination attempts [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3314.48s)]
*  on him. But also, Megan, I think he was changed by the level of support that he sees from the people. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3319.2s)]
*  You know, in 2016, he knew that what he wanted to do was popular, but he couldn't quite get that [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3326.88s)]
*  across. In 2025, he knows that what he wants to do is popular and he knows that the people know it. [[00:55:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3332.4s)]
*  And I think that that confidence is really coming across and it is forcing the Democrats into [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3339.76s)]
*  unforced error after unforced error after unforced error. I mean, you don't need a consultant to tell [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3346.96s)]
*  you don't white knight for the criminal illegal aliens. And yet Megan, they just can't seem to [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3352.48s)]
*  stop. All of them, all of them, Mahmood Khalil. You know what? I made this point when I was arguing [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3359.28s)]
*  with somebody on the show about it, but I was like, they didn't go. They did not go and arrest [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3364.96s)]
*  all of the students at Columbia University who were part taking part of those protests, or all [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3369.44s)]
*  the students at Harvard who were taking part of those protests or any university. They targeted [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3374.48s)]
*  a few who were the leaders, the instigators, who took an extra role and were here thanks to our [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3380.0s)]

*  charged with whatever it was, larceny or vandalism, but there's a reason this guy got targeted. He was [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3392.8s)]
*  here on our good graces. He was a guest in our house and he behaved like an animal. And I don't [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3398.0800000000004s)]
*  care that he didn't actually commit violence on Columbia's campus. He was the spokesperson for the [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3403.76s)]
*  group that held the hostages on campus. The entire campus was held hostage thanks to that group he [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3408.0800000000004s)]
*  represented. And by the way, he worked for the Hamas arm of the UN. That's the lie you're referring [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3414.0s)]
*  to on his visa application. Mysteriously, he forgot to disclose that when he asked us if he could come [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3419.84s)]

*  it's coming back to haunt them though, because they were the ones they were the ones [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3464.8s)]
*  to unleash the dear friend letter during the Obama administration to start using universities [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3472.0s)]
*  to enact their leftist agenda. And of course, the universities were only too happy to comply. [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3478.96s)]
*  That was where their heart was anyway. And Barack Obama used the dear friend letter through his [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3483.36s)]
*  ridiculous Secretary of Education Arne Duncan to say you eliminate due process for young men who [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3487.84s)]
*  are accused on college campuses, or you get the hose again. It's really what he said, all your [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3496.08s)]
*  federal fundings going bye bye. If you don't yank their right to counsel, yank their right to cross [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3501.84s)]
*  examine yank their right to see the evidence against them. That was his big cause to try to [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3507.76s)]
*  completely eliminate due process rights for young men on college campuses. It was so f up. And by [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3514.24s)]
*  the way, there's virtually no rate of appeal, you can try to file in a federal court after you've [[00:58:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3519.52s)]
*  been found guilty as a sexual assault or on a college campus, it almost never gets overturned. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3523.36s)]
*  And even when it does, the university won't help you, they don't have to let you back in. [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3528.08s)]
*  We saw this in the case at Amherst where they completely dropped the ball on this one guy, [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3532.48s)]
*  they didn't care when it was all said and done. It's very hard to get review when you've been [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3536.4s)]
*  fucked over sorry by your college campus in this way, all on the fault of Barack Obama. Why am I [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3540.96s)]
*  bringing that up? Because the Trump administration has a duty. It has a duty under the various [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3546.0s)]
*  federal statutes that are out there, whether it's Title IX to protect women or Title VI to [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3552.64s)]
*  protect any minority group that's become the subject of harassment on college campuses to [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3556.96s)]
*  step in and try to stop it. That's the federal law. You're not allowed to do it. You can hate [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3561.12s)]
*  Jews. Go for it. If that's your thing, great. Good luck with that. But you cannot act on it. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3566.0s)]
*  You cannot act in a discriminatory or harassing fashion. That's the law. There's morality and [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3571.8399999999997s)]
*  then there's legality. And the government, it's their job to enforce legality. And these campuses [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3577.28s)]
*  crossed it. They crossed it with all those absurd protests where they were chanting Hamas slogans [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3582.6400000000003s)]
*  at Jews, harassing them, in some cases, physically berating them or hurting them. And Trump is trying [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3588.0800000000004s)]
*  to bring justice now saying this will never happen again. And here's how we're going to make sure it [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3596.32s)]
*  never happens again. You're going to issue certain reforms on your campus or you're going to lose [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3601.6000000000004s)]
*  your federal dollars. And here are what the reforms are. This is exactly what Obama did, [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3605.04s)]
*  his threats on Title IX. And by the way, what he did to many police stations across the country, [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3610.16s)]
*  you will hire more black and brown people or we will take over. In fact, they did take over [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3616.16s)]
*  many police stations and say, we're running your police station now. We think you're too racist [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3621.36s)]
*  based on sometimes very scurrilous allegations. In any event, so now Trump says to Harvard, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3625.6s)]
*  you will do all these things. And the list of things is actually quite good. I have to say, [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3633.92s)]
*  it's like, I'll read you a couple. We want to see merit based hiring reform. The university must [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3637.44s)]
*  adopt and implement merit based hiring policies, cease all preferences based on race, color, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3644.08s)]
*  religion, sex, or national origin. They should be able to say they'll do that because it's unlawful [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3649.04s)]
*  not to, but they won't. Merit based admissions reform must adopt and implement merit based [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3653.2s)]
*  admissions and cease all preferences based on race, color, national origin, or proxies, [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3659.12s)]
*  et cetera. That too should be a no brainer given the Supreme Court decision on affirmative action, [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3663.3599999999997s)]
*  but they don't want to do it. International admissions reform. You have to reform the way [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3668.3199999999997s)]
*  you recruit and screen international students who are hostile to American values. Why is that a [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3673.3599999999997s)]
*  fucking problem? I'm just like, why are you arguing on that? Then there's reform programs [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3678.88s)]
*  with egregious records of antisemitism or other bias. You have to commission an external party [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3685.52s)]
*  to audit these programs that have been particularly pernicious and fuel the most [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3690.32s)]
*  antisemitic harassment. They don't want to do it. And you have to discontinue DEI, which of course [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3694.64s)]
*  is at the root of a lot of this Jew hatred anyway. They said no. Trump said, say goodbye to $2.2 [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3700.8s)]
*  billion that you're getting now through various federal agencies. And that may not be all. That [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3707.44s)]
*  may not be all. We actually may look into your tax exempt status. If you want to play hardball, [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3712.4s)]
*  let's play hardball. He said, maybe Harvard should lose its tax exempt status and be taxed as a [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3717.6000000000004s)]
*  political entity. If it keeps pushing political, ideological, and terrorist inspired sickness. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3722.7200000000003s)]
*  Remember tax exempt status is totally contingent on acting in the public interest. If that happens, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3727.6800000000003s)]
*  then Harvard's endowment income tax rate could soar from 1.4% to the standard 21% corporate [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3733.2000000000003s)]
*  tax rate, potentially translating to a $525 million annual reduction in their coffers. [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3738.72s)]
*  Who decides to weigh in on how inappropriate this is to use the federal government to threaten the [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3745.6s)]
*  university's Barack Obama botchia? Yeah, it's truly amazing because he doesn't weigh in often. And [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3752.7999999999997s)]
*  then when he does weigh in, it's always on the side of the elites of the elites of the elites [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3762.8s)]
*  in the most unpopular way on the, like to me, Trump has already won because he got Harvard to say, [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3768.6400000000003s)]
*  no way, Jose, we will not stop importing people who hate America and hate Jews. It's like he [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3775.52s)]
*  already won, right? Like whatever happens, he has exposed them for what they are, which is [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3781.6800000000003s)]
*  an institution not of higher learning, but which confers status on people. And the higher status [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3788.64s)]
*  you are is based on how much you hate America and recently how much you hate the Jews, right? Like [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3795.04s)]
*  this is very clear at this point that these institutions are no longer places that give [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3800.8s)]
*  their students some sort of education. What they do give them is an ideology. And of course, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3806.72s)]
*  it was Barack Obama who defunded vocational training in high schools, right? The idea was [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3812.88s)]
*  everyone's going to go to college. And why would he do that? Why would he block millions and millions [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3820.1600000000003s)]
*  and millions of young men of finding their way into the middle class by working with their hands [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3826.0s)]
*  for a living? Well, of course, because the number one predictor for whether you'll be a Democrat is [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3831.2000000000003s)]
*  whether you have a college degree, you know? So they were funneling people into college. [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3835.2000000000003s)]
*  And so your ability to achieve the American dream, thanks to Barack Obama, became contingent on [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3840.08s)]
*  how much anti-American, anti-Semitic, post-structuralist, post-modernist crap [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3847.28s)]
*  you had been exposed to. And of course, you could see how this directly leads to these activist [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3853.44s)]
*  judges. They've been exposed to it for 12 years, right? So they've been exposed to it for many, [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3858.0s)]
*  many, many more years than even just your average undergrad. And so it all comes full circle, right? [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3863.12s)]
*  This is, of course, totally, totally ridiculous. Nobody is owed a Harvard degree. Harvard is not [[01:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3869.28s)]
*  owed taxpayer dollars. Certainly, if it cannot prove that it has the best interests of the United [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3875.28s)]
*  States of America at heart, it's not owed the tax dollars of hardworking Americans, but also the [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3880.96s)]
*  whole system that was built by Obama, the system in which you only get access to the American dream. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3887.2000000000003s)]
*  If you walk the gauntlet of these anti-American institutions, which are nothing more than status [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3896.08s)]
*  conferring operations in which elites confer status and a lot of wealth on each other, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3902.0s)]
*  that whole system is crumbling down. I don't want Harvard to reform. I want us to reform. I want us [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3908.24s)]
*  to stop seeing a Harvard degree as something to be proud of. I want us to stop worshiping at the [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3915.04s)]
*  altar of these institutions that hate us and hate working class people and for the cost of $400,000 [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3921.28s)]
*  a year, teach young Americans who are going to be wealthy to hate the people who they're going to [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3928.7200000000003s)]
*  employ. Let's all just stop. We can stop. However this drama plays out, I think Harvard's going to [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3934.0800000000004s)]
*  cave very, very quickly. I think the Trump administration's letter was an opening salvo. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3940.4s)]
*  I don't think they're going to insist on every aspect of this list. They want certain things [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3945.6800000000003s)]
*  very clearly more than others. They also said investigate all teachers for plagiarism. I like [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3949.44s)]
*  that one. That's probably not a good one. I was also reading that and I was like, [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3953.2000000000003s)]
*  they'll never do that. That's for sure. We really have the power as Americans to say, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3956.08s)]
*  just know, as Trump always says, you don't have to live like this. We don't have to live like that. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3964.32s)]
*  We don't have to give people respect just because they have a Harvard degree or a Princeton degree [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3969.52s)]
*  or a Columbia degree. We can say, actually, this proves to me you spent four years being exposed [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3974.08s)]
*  to the most despicable ideology. It's already happening because corporate America already [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3978.8s)]
*  knows that a Harvard degree isn't what it used to be and it means something else. I'm sorry, [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3982.5600000000004s)]
*  but this is what the left has done. If you happen to be a minority and you're at one of these top [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3987.52s)]
*  elite universities and you graduated from it, it's 10 times so for you. They're going to look at you [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3991.92s)]
*  and think that Harvard accepted you because of your skin color. Whose fault is that? Harvard's. [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=3996.96s)]
*  It's Harvard's fault. It's unfortunate that you went there in a time of exploding DEI where they've [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4001.92s)]
*  changed the merit-based system, but them's the brakes. So great, you have yourself a Harvard [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4008.4s)]
*  degree and now you have yourself a healthy amount of skepticism from all employers because they're [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4012.96s)]
*  wondering whether you really deserve to get in or whether you got in because you checked a box. [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4018.2400000000002s)]
*  This is the system the left has created. So Barack Obama, just for the record, what he said was [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4022.96s)]
*  Harvard has set an example for other higher ed institutions by rejecting this deal, rejecting an [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4028.2400000000002s)]
*  unlawful and ham-handed attempt to stifle academic freedom. Sure, that's really, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4034.8s)]
*  his history supports his commitment to pure academic freedom without any governmental [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4041.44s)]
*  ham-handed attempt to interfere. The nerve. By the way, the best tweet and really this guy [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4046.4s)]
*  might be my favorite follow on Twitter. And that's saying a lot because I have a lot of people I love. [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4051.84s)]
*  He's been on the show, Stephen L. Miller. This is not the Stephen Miller of Trump team. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4055.76s)]
*  This is a commentator who goes by Red Steez. He says, Obama, you know who needs us to defend [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4060.16s)]
*  them right now? Harvard. Bernie. You know who I need to go speak to about income inequality? [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4067.12s)]
*  Coachella. So right. Okay, I have to keep going because there's so much news about you. If I [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4073.2799999999997s)]
*  don't get to spend enough time on Blue Origin, I'm going to be very sad and disappointed in myself. [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4080.16s)]
*  I have to mention quickly, quickly that on the legal front, Pam Bondi just fired off the [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4084.16s)]
*  lawsuit against Maine. It's happening. So the Maine governor, she had her little tette-a-tette [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4091.8399999999997s)]
*  with Trump like, I'm not doing it. He's like, you will do it. And it was C in court. Well, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4095.92s)]
*  they're going to court. She caved almost instantly on the universities because she [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4101.12s)]
*  couldn't lose the money and she knew it, but she did not cave on K through 12. [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4104.5599999999995s)]
*  And so now Pam Bondi just filed a lawsuit saying you will cave. You will cave because there's a [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4109.12s)]
*  whole thing we call a law. It's in short referred to as title nine and you're violating it by [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4115.12s)]
*  letting boys play in girls sports. And by the way, there was just, this is not in our country, [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4122.88s)]
*  but just not for nothing. The UK's Supreme court, their highest court in the country, [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4128.0s)]
*  just ruled today unanimously that the definition of a woman in equality legislation refers to [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4133.44s)]
*  a biological woman and to biological sex and so-called trans women who are, that's not a [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4141.2s)]
*  thing. That's men posing as women are not women. They can call themselves whatever the hell they [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4147.92s)]
*  want, but legally they're not women. And that's the problem that this Maine governor is going to [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4153.839999999999s)]
*  have as this lawsuit goes forward. So good for you, Pam Bondi, totally behind you all the way. [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4159.92s)]
*  Okay. But we've got to get to blue origin because it's over the top. It's over the top. [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4164.32s)]
*  What's happened with these women. We made fun of it on Monday because it was just so ridiculous. [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4169.6s)]
*  The way some of the media were covering it, the way they were like self-congratulatory, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4173.68s)]
*  they've gone next level. Okay. Since then. Okay. First of all, can we, can we pull, [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4177.12s)]
*  I want to hear the Lee, I don't know which sound bite it is you guys, but the montage of them [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4183.28s)]
*  about them. Let's watch out there. It's dark. It's like death. And I'm so proud of us. I really am [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4188.72s)]
*  proud of me. Flowers for me, I believe are, are like God's laughter and God's smile. And I brought [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4198.8s)]
*  a Daisy because I have so much love for my daughter Daisy and I have so much love for mother earth. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4207.2s)]
*  It just says to me, if I can do this, I was telling, I was telling these guys, [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4214.24s)]
*  I might even now get my ears pierced. I've never gotten my ears. [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4218.48s)]
*  Cause that hurts. I hope they can see the unity that we modeled and replicate that and understand [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4222.48s)]
*  that we weren't just taking up space. We were making space for the future. Yeah. Oh my God. [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4231.36s)]
*  10 out of 10 review. Okay. [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4236.48s)]
*  I got, I got one more. I got to add to you, Gail King upset because there's been a lot of blowback [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4242.32s)]
*  and I'll play it in a minute, but like from Hollywood leftists and not just people like you [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4249.679999999999s)]
*  and me, but like Hollywood leftists, these are the people who are supposed to love them, who are [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4254.879999999999s)]
*  ripping these women to shreds. It's beautiful. And Gail King is upset and had a few things that [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4259.6s)]
*  she needed to explain to those of us who don't understand what a hero she is. Watch. [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4266.8s)]
*  Please don't call it a ride. That is not a frigging ride. Whenever a man goes up, [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4272.64s)]
*  you have never said to an astronaut, boy, what a ride. You know, we duplicated the same trajectory [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4277.360000000001s)]
*  that Alan Shepard did back in the day. Pretty much no one called that. It was called a flight. [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4282.88s)]
*  It was called a journey because a right, a ride implies that it's something frivolous or something [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4288.32s)]
*  that's lighthearted. There was nothing frivolous about what we did and, and the machine and the [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4293.36s)]
*  machine that we were on and what it took for the people to get that machine up and running, to get [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4298.799999999999s)]
*  us up and get us back down safely. So, you know, I'm very disappointed and very saddened by it. [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4304.16s)]
*  And I also say this, the, what it's doing to inspire other women and young girls, please don't [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4309.5199999999995s)]
*  ignore that. I've had so many women and young girls reach out to me and men too, by the way, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4315.6s)]
*  men too that say, wow, I never thought I could do that. But I see you doing it at this stage in my [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4320.96s)]
*  life. Who would have thunk it? Not me. And how inspired they are. Okay. There's so much to go [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4326.0s)]
*  over. First of all, Alan Shepard walked on the moon, Gail. You did not fucking walk on the moon. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4333.360000000001s)]
*  Okay. You didn't do the same thing as Alan Shepard. And by the way, when he did his first [[01:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4337.4400000000005s)]
*  space flight, it was the first space flight. That's the reason it was exciting. It wasn't [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4341.84s)]
*  for commercial gain. It wasn't to promote Amazon. It wasn't with some woman with her tits hanging out [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4348.8s)]
*  who needed a little extra attention. Okay. So that's just first. Secondly, there's nothing [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4354.72s)]
*  frivolous about what we did. Let me, let's just check in. We don't have to take her word for it. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4361.04s)]
*  Let's see how it went on board the Blue Origin spacecraft. SOT 22. Here they are in space. [[01:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4365.44s)]
*  Got it. One, two, three. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4373.2s)]
*  Take me up space! [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4378.56s)]
*  Can you carry her Daisy? I got you Flynn. Got you. The moon. You guys, I have to tell you, look at [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4386.4800000000005s)]
*  the moon. That's amazing. Wow. Look at the blue line. Oh my God. Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's amazing. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4395.68s)]
*  I can't. I'm so, I can't get over. There's so much to talk about. Look at the moon. It's dark. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4413.12s)]
*  Stace! There was nothing frivolous. I am like Alan Shepard and I am inspirational. I'm proud of me. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4424.16s)]
*  Good for me. That's the messaging coming back. Right. It's so amazing. Like they went to see [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4431.679999999999s)]
*  space. We're supposed to see them, right? Like they admired the universe and what they were expecting [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4439.44s)]
*  was for us to admire the fact that they were rich enough and famous enough to have been granted [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4446.64s)]
*  this utterly, utterly vacuous experience from which they learned absolutely nothing. [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4454.320000000001s)]
*  This is the Democratic Party, right? It's all acting. It's all celebrity. It's all ostentatious [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4464.0s)]
*  wealth. I mean, this was exactly what Kamala Harris's entire campaign was like, [[01:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4471.76s)]
*  look at us. We're very wealthy. Don't we look great? Admire us. You know, it's so funny. She [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4476.64s)]
*  said she's heard from women and girls who have said to her, I didn't realize this is something [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4482.400000000001s)]
*  I could do. You know how I know that didn't happen, Megan? Cause it's not something they could do [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4486.4800000000005s)]
*  cause they're not friends with Jeff Bezos, right? Like the whole thing is of course, their message [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4491.280000000001s)]
*  for women was take up space like us. Like the reception they got was like the right corrective. [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4497.28s)]
*  You guys are taking up too much space already. Like what are you offering? Where is the service? [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4504.96s)]
*  Where is the sense that we owe something to the society that has made us so unbelievably [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4511.599999999999s)]
*  wealthy? What are you giving back? What they are giving back is their celebrity, the right for us [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4519.92s)]
*  to admire them. Like it is so despicable. It's not just women, although of course, [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4526.16s)]
*  like women do this so much worse cause we always expect to be admired, you know? But you know, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4530.88s)]
*  when the men did this, right? I forget who the billion was it Bezos? Was it Musk? I don't remember [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4535.44s)]
*  who it was that went to space. I think it was Bezos and William Shatner. Right. He came back and he [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4540.0s)]
*  said, wow, you know, we're so small vis a vis the universe. Like the most banal, like, like totally [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4545.2s)]
*  really you went to space. That's what you came back with. And it's just like, these people are so [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4554.400000000001s)]
*  bored, Megan. They have no problems. They have nothing in their lives that they consider to be [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4559.280000000001s)]
*  of value. And what's amazing to me is that it seems like Hollywood knows what time it is, even [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4565.68s)]
*  if these five women didn't, right? Like you really did see people coming out and being like, what the [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4571.12s)]
*  heck is this? Let me show, let me show some of that. Okay. Yeah. The, the just, I'm still stuck [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4577.2s)]
*  in the fact that Gail King actually used the word astronauts in reference to like, we're just like, [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4584.4s)]
*  like an actual astronaut. You are there on a vanity project of Jeff Bezos and his fiance. You've done [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4588.96s)]
*  absolutely nothing to deserve this. You're sitting next to Katy Perry. And if you don't want people [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4596.08s)]
*  to think it's frivolous Gail, then don't have the fucking Kardashians craft side as you take off [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4601.6s)]
*  and Oprah that it, that might have something to do with our reaction to this as a non-serious [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4610.08s)]
*  event, a PR stunt. Okay. Back to the blowback, Olivia Munn. She's an actress. She's got it. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4617.6s)]
*  And I think she speaks for a lot of us when she's trying to espouse [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4627.04s)]
*  why so many on the left and the right had a visceral reaction to this. [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4631.28s)]
*  Like, what are you guys going to do up in space? What are you doing up there? I mean, it's by the [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4637.36s)]
*  way, they're going for 11 minutes. They're going for 11 minutes. They're going up. I think they're [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4640.0s)]
*  going to float around a little and then come back magic mountain. Like you're just going up [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4644.56s)]
*  the base mountain more appropriately space mountain. I think about, I know this is probably [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4649.12s)]
*  obnoxious, but like, um, like it's so much money to go to space. Yeah. You know, and there's, we, [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4654.0s)]
*  there's a lot of people who can't even afford eggs. I just don't, I think it's a bit over the top. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4661.12s)]
*  And I think, um, I just think there are the cover of Elle magazine. I mean, like, isn't it, I don't [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4665.92s)]
*  know. Space exploration was to, to like, to further our knowledge and to help mankind. I mean, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4672.16s)]
*  what are they going to do up there that has made it better for us down here? [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4679.04s)]
*  Absolutely nothing. I'll give you one more, um, model Emily Radikowski, uh, who did a little [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4684.8s)]
*  Instagram post after the fact. Space mission this morning. That's in time. Shit. Like this is beyond [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4691.52s)]
*  parody thing that you care about mother earth and it's about mother earth. And you're going up in a [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4698.8s)]
*  spaceship that is built and paid for by a company that's single-handedly destroying the planet. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4703.28s)]
*  Get the state of the world and think about how many resources went into putting these women into [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4709.84s)]
*  space for what, for what, what was the marketing there? And then to try to make it like I, I'm [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4714.88s)]
*  disgusted. Literally I'm disgusted. She's raised a good point. Where's Greta Turnberg? Where's it? [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4719.68s)]
*  Where's her protest on how many carbon emissions we had to suffer just so that Gail could be proud [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4725.52s)]
*  of herself. Olivia Wilde reposted an image of Katy Perry kissing the ground. Honestly, truly she was [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4731.360000000001s)]
*  acting like she got back from Apollo 13, um, kissing the red and she captioned it billion dollars, [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4739.200000000001s)]
*  but some good memes, I guess here was Amy Schumer doing her own version of making fun of these women. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4744.96s)]
*  Watch guys. Last second, they added me to space and I'm going to space. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4751.04s)]
*  I'm bringing this thing. Um, it has no meaning to me, but, um, it was in my bag and I was like [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4761.36s)]
*  on the subway and I got the text and they were like, do you want to go to space? So I'm going [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4773.28s)]
*  to space and thank you to everyone who got me here and I'll see you guys in space. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4778.08s)]
*  Nailed it. She's mocking them very heartily. Mocking them. Kesha mocked them. I mean, like [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4784.56s)]
*  it's that's what gets them upset. That's why Gail did that little we're inspirational and [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4793.6s)]
*  we're astronauts. I am Alan Shepard video. First of all, that's the funniest I've seen [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4799.200000000001s)]
*  Amy Schumer and maybe 10 years, 15 years. It was really, really funny. Um, I think that this is [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4805.200000000001s)]
*  kind of a turning point, Megan. Like I feel like the vibe is shifting. Like a year ago, [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4811.36s)]
*  you would not have seen the left like openly admitting like, this is not cool anymore. It's [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4816.96s)]
*  almost like these women in their space mission admitted a little bit too much. You know, they [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4822.719999999999s)]
*  became, they went from being like the apotheosis of what the leftist elites and Hollywood and [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4827.5199999999995s)]
*  entertainment represents to just like exposing it a little bit too much. Like if the message had been [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4833.28s)]
*  like slightly better, nobody would have come out against it. But now it's very interesting to see [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4838.96s)]
*  the cracks in the very elites that these women come from. They realize that they've lost the plot. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4843.68s)]
*  They realize that they've lost the country. Nobody's going to see their movies. Nobody's [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4850.56s)]
*  watching their TV shows. There's no purchase for that ostentatious liberal, vacuous, empty [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4855.12s)]
*  culture anymore. And I think we're going to look back on this moment as maybe the moment that we [[01:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4863.92s)]
*  started to realize that we were in full on woke lash and people wanted to return to substance [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4868.64s)]
*  and to unifying messages and to actual entertainment, actual culture that has real meaning for people. [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4874.72s)]
*  I love that. I agree. And I also think there's the element of it's got, it's got a little bit [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4882.88s)]
*  of a stolen valor feel to it where we revere our astronauts, our actual astronauts who actually do [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4888.08s)]
*  put themselves in harm's way in order to forge new frontiers. And we've seen astronauts, actual [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4897.92s)]
*  ones die in the name of this service. We've seen even civilians like Kristin McAuliffe, when, you [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4906.24s)]
*  know, people of my age were in middle school and we all watched that flight take off the space shuttle [[01:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4912.56s)]
*  and, and burn in the air. It was horrifying. So there have been civilians to go up to. They [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4917.68s)]
*  wear actual spacesuits. They go through real training, not two days of learning how to buckle [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4923.6s)]
*  your seatbelt, which is literally what they did. That's what they're touting as their training, [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4928.240000000001s)]
*  buckling the seatbelt, getting in and out of the vessel and learning how to press the button so [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4933.200000000001s)]
*  they could speak to mission control. That is not, that doesn't make you an astronaut. Okay. Sorry, [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4937.6s)]
*  Gail and everybody else on board. And I just feel like how dare you, how dare you utter the name, [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4942.96s)]
*  Alan Shepard. How dare you, you and he have absolutely nothing in common, absolutely nothing. [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4949.36s)]
*  And so I like she, and they actually seem to have expected a Neil Armstrong type welcome home. [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4957.679999999999s)]
*  And I'm really uplifted by the fact that left and right, because I think you and I have probably [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4965.759999999999s)]
*  zero in common with Amy Schumer and certainly Olivia Wilde, other than our ability to see through [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4971.679999999999s)]
*  this PR stunt farce. Absolutely. I'll give you the last word. One more quick point, which is [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4978.56s)]
*  I forget his name, the astronaut who Elon Musk just rescued from space. There was a woman and a [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4986.64s)]
*  man, the man, Megan, he went to church services every Sunday from space. I can't remember the [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=4991.04s)]
*  last time I heard something so inspiring. This man was in space and he did not miss a single [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5000.96s)]
*  Sunday service. And I mean, if he could do it, we can do it. But he brought his spirituality and his [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5009.36s)]
*  faith up into space with him. Like it was so beautiful. The idea that even there, when you're [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5017.2s)]
*  so close to the heavens and you have this perspective, what he was longing for, what his [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5024.48s)]
*  soul needed was to be tied to his faith community here on earth. And these women went up there in [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5030.32s)]
*  search of meaning and came down just as vacuous as they had left. The meaning they came back with was [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5037.759999999999s)]
*  I am important and I am your hero. I am. Damn it. You will look up to me. You will call it a mission, [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5044.5599999999995s)]
*  not a flight. Congratulations. Me. And again, I mean, my guess made this point yesterday was a [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5052.88s)]
*  very good one, which is I think it was, who was it who was making this Walter or on Monday about [[01:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5059.04s)]
*  how they completely ignored all these same news stations who want us to celebrate these women [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5064.16s)]
*  completely ignored. Elon Musk's rescue of those two astronauts on board the international space [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5068.4800000000005s)]
*  station. He rescued them. They'd been stuck up there for the better part of a year. They didn't [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5074.16s)]
*  find that interesting at all, but this vapidity celebrated like the second coming. So I love the [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5078.16s)]
*  backlash. I am here for it. And I feel it too. Batya love talking to you. Thank you so much for [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5083.76s)]
*  being here. Thank you so much, Megan. I love you. God bless you and God bless your viewers. And [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5089.76s)]
*  thank you for everything you do for this great nation and for the Jewish people. Oh, you're so [[01:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5094.96s)]

*  for the doctor, a doctor and a lawyer walked into a courtroom that the lawyer for the doctor who [[01:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5105.52s)]
*  just sued NBC News for defamation and they settled it because the judge had said you have to go to [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5110.88s)]
*  trial. What you said NBC News was totally false and they were supposed to start that trial on [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5117.4400000000005s)]
*  April 22nd. It was settled. They say they're very happy with the settlement. What the hell happened? [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5124.8s)]
*  The lawyer's here next. Grand Canyon University is a private Christian university in beautiful [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5131.12s)]

*  NBC Universal and a Georgia doctor. This after MSNBC ran multiple reports in September 2020 with [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5236.64s)]
*  allegations that this doctor performed mass hysterectomies at an ICE detention facility. [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5244.0s)]
*  Well, we dug into what really happened. It started with an advocacy group called Project South, [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5251.2s)]
*  and they released an open letter to the Department of Homeland Security criticizing conditions [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5257.28s)]
*  at the Irwin County Detention Center in Georgia, which at the time was run by ICE and had detained [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5262.24s)]
*  immigrants staying there. The letter was primarily about the lack of COVID precautions there, [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5269.6s)]
*  but it also included shocking allegations from a nurse named Dan Wooten claiming, Dawn, I should [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5274.4800000000005s)]
*  say, not Dan, that's our friend, Dawn Wooten, claiming that a doctor was performing hysterectomies [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5281.280000000001s)]
*  on nearly every patient that he saw, calling him quote, a uterus collector. Well, MSNBC took up the [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5287.120000000001s)]
*  story the very next day with Nicole Wallace, Chris Hayes, and Rachel Maddow all covering the [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5295.04s)]
*  report on their shows. Here's Maddow quoting the shocking claims. The nurse who contributed to this [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5300.64s)]
*  whistleblower complaint explains it like this, quote, everybody this doctor sees has a hysterectomy, [[01:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5305.76s)]
*  just about everybody. He's even taken out the wrong ovary on one detained immigrant woman. She was [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5310.4s)]
*  supposed to get her left ovary removed because it had a cyst on the left ovary. He took out the [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5315.28s)]
*  right one. She was upset. She had to go back to take out the left and she wound up with a total [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5319.44s)]
*  hysterectomy. She still wanted children. So she has to go back home now and tell her husband that [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5325.04s)]
*  she can't bear kids. She said she was not all the way out under anesthesia and heard the doctor tell [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5329.28s)]
*  the nurse that he took out the wrong ovary. The nurse says she and her fellow nurses, quote, [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5334.24s)]
*  questioned among ourselves, like, goodness, he's taking everybody's stuff out. That's his specialty. [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5339.44s)]
*  He's the uterus collector. She says, quote, I know that's ugly. Is he collecting these things [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5344.32s)]
*  or something? Everybody he sees, he's taking all their uteruses out or he's taking their tubes out. [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5350.24s)]
*  What in the world? Well, there's just one problem. It's not true. Dr. Mahendra Amin only performed two [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5354.5599999999995s)]
*  medically necessary hysterectomies on detainees at that ICE facility. And he was not happy with this [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5363.44s)]
*  report. The guy spent his whole life helping underprivileged communities, volunteering his [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5370.24s)]
*  time, helping people who cannot pay. And he got viciously smeared originally by this nurse who [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5375.76s)]
*  worked at the facility. And then NBC News and MSNBC News ran with it. And the good doctor filed a [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5382.719999999999s)]
*  $30 million defamation lawsuit against NBC Universal in September or back in September. [[01:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5390.24s)]
*  NBC settled. They settled after discovery in this case showed that even internally at the [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5397.360000000001s)]
*  news organization, they had significant doubts about whether this was true, even as they presented [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5403.4400000000005s)]
*  the allegations to their audience without reflecting those serious doubts. We reached out to NBC [[01:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5410.72s)]
*  Universal for comment. We have not heard back here now to explain more is Stacy Evans, Dr. Amin's [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5419.04s)]
*  attorney. Stacy, thank you so much for being here. I know that- Thank you so much for having me and [[01:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5424.72s)]
*  sharing the story. Yes. You're, I'm told a Democratic lawmaker in the state of Georgia and that many [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5429.04s)]
*  people would not expect you to be suing MSNBC, which is beloved by a lot of Democrats. So [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5435.4400000000005s)]
*  did you have any hesitancy in taking this case? I didn't. I definitely thought in my mind this [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5441.52s)]
*  could hurt me politically. And in fact, I had some attacks. You proclaimed to be this progressive [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5447.84s)]
*  champion. How could you defend this man, this doctor? And I said, well, it's very easy because [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5453.92s)]
*  he didn't do these terrible things that the media is claiming that he did, that MSNBC is claiming [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5459.28s)]
*  that he did, that this alleged whistleblower is claiming that he did. And for me, whether it's a [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5464.4800000000005s)]
*  Democratic leaning media or Republican leaning media, you got to tell the truth. I mean, [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5471.84s)]
*  the media is a very important part of our systems of government really. And they need to get it [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5476.32s)]
*  right. And so it's my job. I feel like as a defamation lawyer to hold anyone accountable, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5483.76s)]
*  who's not telling the truth, whether that's the network I watch or another network. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5488.08s)]
*  Good for you. Not everybody sees the world like that. So I applaud you and your objectivity. [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5493.360000000001s)]
*  Just so the audience can understand how this got started. I mentioned this nurse who works [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5499.280000000001s)]
*  there named Dawn Wooten. Here she is talking to NBC's Jacob Soboroff and making these allegations [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5502.88s)]
*  against Dr. Amin. This is from September 15th, 2020. Your quote in the complaint is saying, [[01:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5509.5199999999995s)]
*  that's his specialty. He's the uterus collector. Is that how people refer to this doctor? [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5516.5599999999995s)]
*  That's how the detainees refer to this physician. They referred to him as I had a detainee to ask [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5523.2s)]
*  me, she said, well, what is he doing? Miss Wooten collecting all of our uteruses. [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5530.879999999999s)]
*  And I just looked at her puzzle because I didn't have an answer. [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5534.16s)]
*  Later, the Department of Homeland Security Inspector General would conduct an investigation. [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5543.5199999999995s)]
*  This is after the allegations aired. It was in January of 2022. And they released a report [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5552.0s)]
*  finding based on its medical records review, the National Commission on Correctional Health Care [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5558.0s)]
*  Resources Team determined women's health care provided by Dr. Amin to be appropriate. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5562.64s)]
*  So they're basically saying that, well, he's not mentioned by name, nothing untoward happened there, [[01:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5570.0s)]
*  nothing that wasn't medically necessary. So what exactly did NBC and MSNBC do wrong? [[01:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5575.12s)]
*  Well, they called Dr. Amin a uterus collector. They said that Dr. Amin performed mass hysterectomies, [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5582.4800000000005s)]
*  high number of hysterectomies and that they were unnecessary and that they were unconsented to. [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5588.24s)]
*  None of those things are true. And the court even found in her summary judgment order, Judge Wood [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5593.5199999999995s)]
*  of the Southern District of Georgia found in 108 page order, very clearly there is no evidence of [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5597.84s)]
*  mass hysterectomies, no evidence of high numbers of hysterectomies and no evidence that Dr. Amin [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5603.84s)]
*  is a uterus collector and also relayed information to make clear that Don Wooten was not telling the [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5609.2s)]
*  truth and MSNBC was not telling the truth to repeat it when she said all these detainees called [[01:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5616.56s)]
*  Dr. Amin the uterus collector. I took deposition after deposition after deposition of women who [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5621.04s)]
*  had been formally detained at Irwin County Detention Center and others who had been there [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5626.8s)]
*  and no one heard him be called the uterus collector until after MSNBC's news reports, [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5631.92s)]
*  which the detainees obviously had access to watching television like any of us, but no one [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5638.56s)]
*  admitted to ever using that phrase and no one even heard it until after the report. [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5644.4800000000005s)]
*  So MSNBC took these allegations, which were salacious and it was right in the middle of [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5648.8s)]
*  an election year. We were six weeks before the 2020 election and they ran with it and they tried to [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5655.52s)]
*  tie Dr. Amin, an immigrant himself, to what they portrayed as terrible atrocious things that were [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5662.16s)]
*  happening to immigrants during the Trump administration. And I and others agree, [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5669.52s)]
*  I mean the child separation policies, there were these administrators who were tracking menstrual [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5674.240000000001s)]
*  cycles of women. Rachel Maddow said that Dr. Amin, my client, a man who's been practicing medicine [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5679.4400000000005s)]
*  for over 35 years, devoted himself to these underserved areas, took on these cases of the [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5686.080000000001s)]
*  detainees because he knew no one else would do it. For most of his career, he's been the only or [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5693.120000000001s)]
*  one of only a few OBGYNs in a very wide radius in a rural part of South Georgia. So they said, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5699.12s)]
*  this man, my client, Dr. Amin, one of the most gentle people you'll ever meet, was the next [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5705.04s)]
*  chapter in this saga of immigration abuse that's happening in our country. Again, an immigrant [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5710.08s)]
*  himself ties him to that without not only not looking as deep as they needed to, but the surface [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5715.84s)]
*  level that they did look into told them that these allegations from this alleged whistleblower [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5724.16s)]
*  were not corroborated. Let me stop you there. Let me stop you there just to set the scene. And I [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5729.12s)]
*  appreciate you mentioning the election because it's very interesting. I mean, we've seen this so many [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5734.4s)]
*  times where mistakes, mistakes, or intentional misstatements get made in service of a political [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5737.599999999999s)]
*  narrative that somebody finds important. And I think obviously MSNBC was guilty of that here. [[01:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5746.24s)]
*  It was too good. It was too good not to report. It would hurt Trump. It would hurt him on one of [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5752.24s)]
*  his key issues, immigration. And look what they're doing. He's basically got a Joseph Mengele in there [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5757.5199999999995s)]
*  taking out uteruses for fun. This is sick. These people are sick. So I see it. I see exactly what [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5764.32s)]
*  you're saying here. But that's one of the things I wanted to get into because it wasn't just MSNBC. [[01:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5769.28s)]
*  The Guardian, some other publications, mostly left wing ran with these same allegations by this [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5774.639999999999s)]
*  nurse, but you didn't sue them. And there is a reason that you zeroed in on NBC and MSNBC. [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5779.84s)]
*  And I think it's, well, it's a couple fold. You explain. Well, there were some earlier sort of [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5786.400000000001s)]
*  lesser known print, maybe online publications that were talking about the story in general, [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5793.4400000000005s)]
*  but it was MSNBC that first named Dr. Amin. And they were proud of that. They said, [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5800.88s)]
*  we broke the story. We got his name and we told everyone. They were very proud of that. [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5806.64s)]
*  And then they were the only broadcast media to run with the story. And they did it again in the face [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5811.6s)]
*  of on the same day that they were up reporting, ICE telling them, we've only got records of two [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5820.240000000001s)]
*  hysterectomies being done at this facility at all, whether by Dr. Amin. At the time, they didn't know [[01:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5825.52s)]
*  if there were other doctors that may be treating women at that facility. That's what MSNBC did, [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5831.04s)]
*  which was very reckless. They had the biggest microphone, the biggest camera, and they blasted [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5836.88s)]
*  his name and blasted his picture across on things that were false. And that from their own [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5841.5199999999995s)]
*  investigation, they had feedback telling them it wasn't there. Their own internal people saying, [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5847.44s)]
*  we don't have it. And I know we may talk about that more if you want me to go into some of the [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5853.76s)]
*  things that they knew. Well, let's, so I definitely want to do that. I'm running out of time on my [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5858.24s)]
*  SiriusXM live show and we're going to continue this over on pod and YouTube. So I'll start [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5863.28s)]
*  something a little, I'll keep us on something less deep because that's a deep one. But yeah, [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5867.92s)]
*  so he had multiple news organizations, but MSNBC and NBC was the worst and the ones with the biggest [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5872.32s)]
*  microphone reporting this about them. Can I ask you before, in the time we have, do we know [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5878.88s)]
*  why this nurse made these allegations? Cause I saw some reference to she had an axe to grind. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5884.240000000001s)]
*  Well, she had, she definitely had some issues employment wise with the facility. Who's right [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5890.0s)]
*  or wrong in that? I don't know, but she was very upset about her status as an employee and being [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5895.76s)]
*  her hours being cut down or something like that. And she was mainly concerned about COVID protections [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5900.400000000001s)]
*  at the facility. This was September, 2020. We were in the height of COVID. She was complaining that [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5905.76s)]
*  the safety protocols weren't being followed. And she had some of her own health issues that [[01:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5910.64s)]
*  she was worried about and being forced to work in these conditions. That's what she was trying [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5916.160000000001s)]
*  to share. You know, this 26 page letter, I believe it was total only one little paragraph about [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5920.08s)]
*  hysterectomies, but her advocates through this advocacy organization had been trying to get [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5926.0s)]
*  attention on COVID for a while and no one was biting. And I think they needed something [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5931.200000000001s)]
*  sensational. And why she chose to say that he did this, I'll never know. [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5936.64s)]
*  So let's talk now about what you discovered about MSNBC and NBC in particular, because this was [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5942.08s)]
*  really, you know, I don't know whether you would have won the defamation claim against them, even [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5948.96s)]
*  though we now know what they reported was untrue, but they did try to cross cross some T's and dot [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5953.76s)]
*  some I. So when I was reading up in the case, I was like, how did they win this? And then I got to [[01:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5959.12s)]
*  the page that explains how you want it. But just to set it up, they did try to do some things. [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5964.16s)]
*  They reached out right to the doctor for comment. And they, they included, I think his denial [[01:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5970.72s)]
*  in the ultimate report that it wasn't true. But that, as it turns out, wasn't sufficient, because [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5979.84s)]
*  Well, they did include his, his denial, which was general. And one of the things to keep in mind here, [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5987.68s)]
*  and that was very frustrating for Dr. Amin is, I mean, he's a doctor, he is bound by the laws of [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5994.5599999999995s)]
*  HIPAA, he can't go digging through his medical records and throw them up on the screen and say, [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=5999.76s)]
*  see here, this is why I did the hysterectomy. These are the hysterectomies I did. He cannot [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6004.0s)]
*  talk about specific patients. He cannot talk about specific things that happened with them. And so [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6009.2s)]
*  that general denial was, was all he could do. But what, what was true, and what we just got worse, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6014.64s)]
*  as we were peeling back the layers during discovery is this whole thing started with [[01:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6022.4800000000005s)]
*  Julia Ainsley and Jacob Soaroff were writing working together on an article that was going to [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6027.4400000000005s)]
*  be for NBC News online. And they were calling immigration lawyers in Georgia, obviously speaking [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6032.56s)]
*  to Don Wooten. And what they found in the course of doing that is that the immigration lawyers were [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6040.72s)]
*  telling them, you know, when this story broke, we started calling our colleagues, one of the [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6046.16s)]
*  immigration lawyers that they talked to was a leader in this 15,000 plus member association [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6050.96s)]
*  of immigration lawyers all across the country. And she had access to all the ones there in the [[01:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6057.68s)]
*  southeast and Georgia in particular, they were not seeing high numbers of hysterectomies. And they [[01:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6062.400000000001s)]
*  told the reporters at MSNBC that's unclear whether it was Jacob that they told her Julia, [[01:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6067.36s)]
*  but they told one of them, we are not seeing it, we are calling around, we are asking people to [[01:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6072.719999999999s)]
*  report to us, and we are not seeing it going to air, they really only had hard evidence of one [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6077.12s)]
*  hysterectomy. And they had that from an immigration lawyer who told them, and she had cancer. [[01:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6085.2s)]
*  That's what they had. Now, they said they had more than that, but they never did the most they ever [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6092.32s)]
*  had was two, that's what ICE was saying, is that there were two reported out from ICE, and that they [[01:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6096.32s)]
*  were approved through their internal procedures to be necessary. And then you had standards who was [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6102.0s)]
*  looking at that article. Standards and practices, we've talked about them with my audience there. [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6108.639999999999s)]
*  At NBC, it's pretty rigorous where you go through this team of lawyers and sort of professional [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6113.28s)]
*  journalists who make sure or try that you don't defame people in your reporting. And especially [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6117.36s)]
*  when you have a report like this that's incendiary, I mean, you're setting this guy on fire with these [[01:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6123.5199999999995s)]
*  allegations, it would be subjected to higher scrutiny. So keep going. Yeah, absolutely. And [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6127.12s)]
*  I personally felt sorry for Christopher Scholl was the deputy head of standards at the time. [[01:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6132.879999999999s)]
*  And he was clearly pushing back and he was saying, we have this one source, she has no direct [[01:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6137.679999999999s)]
*  knowledge, because she told even Jacob Soboroff, I didn't go with the women during their medical [[01:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6144.32s)]
*  treatments. And Dr. Amin never set foot onto the campus of Irwin County Detention Center. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6149.76s)]
*  The women were brought to his private medical office. Don Wooten said, the alleged whistleblower, [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6154.88s)]
*  I didn't go there. I don't know what happened. So she has no firsthand knowledge. And the deputy [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6160.8s)]
*  head of standards is pointing this out, guys, hey, we have one source with no direct knowledge. [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6165.360000000001s)]
*  This is sensational. We've got these folks saying, maybe we found one, you've got ICE saying there's [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6170.400000000001s)]
*  two, we don't have it. And there's evidence that we developed that, that standards never actually [[01:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6177.04s)]
*  approved that online news report, which ended up being the basis for all the on air. Now they [[01:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6185.36s)]
*  dispute and say, Oh, yeah, we did, we did, we did approve. But there's there's some emails later, [[01:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6190.96s)]
*  where the deputy head of standards is saying, these articles shouldn't go out without standards [[01:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6195.92s)]
*  seeing a final version, and they should not be considered approved based on answers to questions, [[01:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6201.84s)]
*  which is all there was back and forth, all these emails, questions, answers, questions, answers, [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6206.08s)]
*  but then more questions. And then all of a sudden, the news article is up and Julia Ainslie's on [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6210.5599999999995s)]
*  Deadline White House. And then from there, you know, it goes to Chris Hayes. [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6215.5199999999995s)]
*  That's Nicole Wallace's show. [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6218.72s)]
*  Yeah, it was the original article on NBC.com or MSNBC.com? [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6221.28s)]
*  NBC news.com. Yeah, it was an NBC news story. [[01:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6226.0s)]
*  Wow. And those warnings from standards and practices were issued prior to them posting [[01:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6230.32s)]
*  that article and then doing all these segments on MSNBC. [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6235.2s)]
*  Yeah, prior to posting the article online and prior to any on air, including the Deadline White [[01:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6238.4s)]
*  House show. And then you also had you had Chris Hayes behind the scenes internally with standards [[01:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6244.639999999999s)]
*  saying, you know, this whole thing went viral because it sort of brings up all these Third [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6251.2s)]
*  Reich, Jim Crow, Mississippi hospitalization experiments. And that's not the case here. [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6256.639999999999s)]
*  That's what he said internally. That's why it went viral. It's so sensational. It brings up [[01:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6262.72s)]
*  all these bad historical implications. But that's not true here. He acknowledges that internally. [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6267.2s)]
*  That same night, he goes on his show and he says, this story went viral because of the historical [[01:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6272.08s)]
*  ramifications of any kind of coerced sterilization of an immigrant population. So the exact same [[01:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6278.72s)]
*  thing that he said this is not internally, he told the viewers. That's why this is such a big story, [[01:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6284.96s)]
*  because this is what it makes us think of. It was very, very reckless and very disappointing to me [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6291.6s)]
*  to see that see it happen this way. Incredibly two faced. Here he is having that same nurse on [[01:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6297.280000000001s)]
*  his show again, after all these warnings from standards and others behind the scenes. 37. [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6303.4400000000005s)]
*  You have detained women. I had several detained women on numerous occasions that would come to [[01:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6310.320000000001s)]
*  me and say, Miss Wooten, I had hysterectomy. Why? I had no answers as to why they had those procedures. [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6316.96s)]
*  And one lady walked up to me here this last time around between October of 19 until July the second. [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6327.52s)]
*  And she said, what is he? Is he the uterus collector? Does he collect uteruses? And I [[01:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6338.32s)]
*  asked her, what does she mean? And she says, everybody that I talked to has had a hysterectomy [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6344.08s)]
*  and you just don't know what to say. I mean, I don't have a answer for why that they would [[01:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6351.36s)]
*  come to me and they would say, is he the uterus collector? [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6359.44s)]
*  Now in that interview, did Chris Hayes express strong skepticism? Like this is hearsay, you can't [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6366.48s)]
*  produce the women. How do you know it's six? Like, was there anything to mitigate the damage [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6373.2s)]
*  in those allegations? No, and that was the bigger problem. It would have been one thing to say, [[01:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6378.24s)]
*  okay, here's what Don Wooten is saying, but we haven't been able to verify from anyone who was [[01:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6383.84s)]
*  actually in the room. We haven't looked at medical records. We're being skeptical here, [[01:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6390.08s)]
*  which internally they were saying, standards was saying to Chris Hayes specifically, [[01:46:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6395.599999999999s)]
*  we need to be skeptical. And in fact, they were just validating. I don't remember if it was Chris [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6400.08s)]
*  Hayes or other on air talent or his producers that were calling Don Wooten their hero. And our hero [[01:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6405.84s)]
*  is here to share the truth with us, just really putting her up on a pedestal and then calling [[01:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6411.36s)]
*  Dr. Amin, a so-called medical professional. That's how things were going behind the scenes. So [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6416.16s)]
*  they're definitely saying one thing behind the scenes and then they're saying another thing on [[01:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6423.36s)]
*  air. And then it goes up. So you've got Nicole Wallace at Deadline White House, then you've got [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6427.68s)]
*  Chris Hayes all in, and then after that you've got Rachel Maddow, which really took it to the [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6433.68s)]
*  next level. And we alluded to it earlier when she made this really an election issue and said, this [[01:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6439.200000000001s)]
*  is the Trump administration's mistreatment of immigrants. And Dr. Amin is part of that and [[01:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6445.04s)]
*  going through the child separation policy and going through tracking of immigrant women's [[01:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6450.72s)]
*  menstrual cycles when they're in detention. And now Dr. Amin, the next chapter. And that was such [[01:47:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6456.4s)]
*  a terrible outlandish thing to say, but even more so because earlier that day when she was [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6461.44s)]
*  internal records during discovery revealed, she had been having her production meeting with her [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6468.48s)]
*  team. And she starts out saying, if it's true, we should go with it. But there's some reason to be [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6474.16s)]
*  doubtful here. I think there's a lot of jumping to conclusions. And then according to the document, [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6480.72s)]
*  eight minutes later, she is saying, this is going to be the A block and this is going to be the next [[01:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6486.56s)]
*  chapter of this immigration situation with no evidence that we ever saw that any new information [[01:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6492.16s)]
*  came in. And that to me is just so egregious. And she's got such a platform and so many people look [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6497.76s)]
*  up to her as a smart and hardworking and thorough journalist. And for her to be so flippant about [[01:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6504.240000000001s)]
*  Dr. Amin and what he did here just was really too much. [[01:48:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6510.16s)]
*  Did she explain in the deposition why the change of heart in eight minutes? [[01:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6515.2s)]
*  No, no, there was not that. And in fact, for her and some of the other folks that we [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6520.72s)]
*  depose on air talent, but also producers, what struck me was how flippant folks were about, [[01:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6527.28s)]
*  that was a long time ago. I do a lot of stories. I don't remember. That one just didn't stick out [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6535.04s)]
*  for me. And I thought, how callous and yeah, maybe it was a flashpoint in time for you. [[01:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6540.48s)]
*  Maybe it was part of some agenda for you. But this was Dr. Amin's life. This is what he lives [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6548.08s)]
*  with every day. Maybe you can move on from it in a second and put it out of your mind and not worry [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6553.6s)]
*  about how reckless you were. But he had to live with this. He had to live with the death threats, [[01:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6557.92s)]
*  the bomb threats, the constant calls to his office, the following of him, the name calling, [[01:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6562.72s)]
*  some of the most vile things to be called. His own staff, he had several Hispanic women [[01:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6568.96s)]
*  working for him. He lost some employees over this. A lot of the women stayed and they took also [[01:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6576.320000000001s)]
*  flack in their own communities and with their family and friends because they were working for [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6584.0s)]
*  him. But they knew, they knew this man. They knew that this wasn't true. They knew that [[01:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6588.32s)]
*  how these women were treated, which was well when they were in Dr. Amin's office. And thank goodness, [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6593.5199999999995s)]
*  they stood by him. But it was a terrible time and he wasn't able to move on. [[01:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6598.0s)]
*  JAIME TARDY Can you tell the story, Stacey, of what happened with his son [[01:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6601.92s)]
*  who was off to the Cleveland Clinic as a doctor in his own right? [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6605.84s)]
*  STACEY KAPLAN Absolutely. Dr. Amin's son, his middle name is Mahendra, the same as Dr. Amin's [[01:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6608.639999999999s)]
*  first name, Paraj, Mahendra, Dr. Amin himself. And when all of the news hit and Dr. Amin was [[01:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6614.72s)]
*  very scared about what was going to happen to him and others, he immediately thought of his son and [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6623.84s)]
*  he called his son. He said, you might get calls because your name is so close to mine. And if you [[01:50:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6627.2s)]
*  get calls, just tell them you don't know me. Just tell them that you don't know me, that it's just a [[01:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6631.84s)]
*  coincidence that you have the same name. Because he was so concerned that his son who just got in [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6636.88s)]
*  his dream job was going to be affected negatively about this, so much so that he was just like, [[01:50:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6641.92s)]
*  pretend like you don't know me. And that just breaks my heart. I mean, Dr. Amin is a father of four, [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6647.2s)]
*  caring husband, doctor, father, and to know that he had to say that to his son, it's heartbreaking. [[01:50:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6652.32s)]
*  JAIME TARDY Especially in light of what you just said, which is they had doubts, [[01:51:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6660.8s)]
*  they reversed them. It seems clear they did that because they thought it was a story that was going [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6665.28s)]
*  to work for Team Blue and for their own ratings, notwithstanding their knowledge that there were [[01:51:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6670.4s)]
*  serious holes in the story. And then we're so callous and disgusting, like, I don't know, [[01:51:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6676.08s)]
*  I ruin a lot of people's lives. I'm not sure. That's really kind of how it sounds. Like, [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6680.4s)]
*  I've ruined a lot of people since Dr. Amin can't keep up with them all. [[01:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6684.48s)]
*  Look, I have empathy for news organizations, because we're all in a position of trying to [[01:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6688.719999999999s)]
*  report on day's news. And sometimes you get duped. Sometimes you have dishonest brokers. [[01:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6691.839999999999s)]
*  The thing that makes this story different and that really makes a villain out of the actors you've [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6696.96s)]
*  mentioned is that they knew or had reason to know this one was false. It would have been a [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6701.36s)]
*  totally different story if they had her word. They couldn't get in touch with Dr. Amin. They [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6708.24s)]
*  didn't get a denial. And they reported it straight as, look, she's filed this whistleblower complaint. [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6714.0s)]
*  This is what she's alleged. We're going to continue to try to reach out to him and get comment, [[01:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6720.0s)]
*  whatever. But they didn't. They actually did go beyond that. And when they got there, [[01:52:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6723.44s)]
*  they learned that the story had tons of holes in it. And then even then you could potentially [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6728.4s)]
*  avoid liability if you went on the air and said, here are the allegations and here are all the [[01:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6734.5599999999995s)]
*  holes in it. Right? Like that too could potentially spare you. But just going with these are the [[01:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6738.32s)]
*  allegations. Oh, and by the way, he gave us a denial. And without reporting any of the serious [[01:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6744.08s)]
*  problems you've discovered behind the scenes, that's what got you to defamation because [[01:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6749.2s)]
*  for some reason they decided to treat him as a public figure, even though he wasn't, [[01:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6754.0s)]
*  but whatever, it's not important. So you had a higher burden in bringing a defamation claim [[01:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6757.04s)]
*  against MSNBC and NBC. And you had to prove actual malice on their part, that they knew what they [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6763.5199999999995s)]
*  were saying was false or behaved in reckless disregard of its truth or falsity. And I think [[01:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6770.0s)]
*  that latter point is that's where all these messages came in. You submitted in the case [[01:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6775.36s)]
*  text messages between Julia Ainsley, who you mentioned and Jacob Soboroff. She texts to him [[01:53:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6781.36s)]
*  saying, but only two hysterectomies or do you think they only referred those? And he also did [[01:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6786.88s)]
*  others. She's trying to say, maybe they referred others and we don't have a record of them. And [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6793.28s)]
*  Soboroff answers, I think it's possible or likely lots of lawyers saying it. Then you've got this [[01:53:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6796.639999999999s)]
*  one source, an immigration lawyer named Sarah Owings, who told Soboroff that she and her [[01:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6804.08s)]
*  colleagues were not finding evidence of a large number of hysterectomies. The Rachel Maddow [[01:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6808.48s)]
*  meeting that you just outlined, that guy you mentioned from standards and practices, Chris [[01:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6814.32s)]
*  Scholl. You say standards weighed in on this prior to the airing of the reports, but this is from a [[01:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6818.0s)]
*  follow-up segment that Chris Hayes was going to do two days after the original report, where [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6823.44s)]
*  standards, this guy, Chris Scholl is jumping up and down saying that you don't have it, like stop [[01:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6827.84s)]
*  doing this. The quotes are Scholl saying, we don't know if the doctor did anything wrong here. In [[01:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6832.8s)]
*  fact, the guy has a pretty clean record. Scholl doubted the credibility of that nurse Wooten in [[01:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6839.2s)]
*  the same call, quote, and the whistleblower has no direct knowledge of this stuff. She kind of has [[01:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6844.400000000001s)]
*  a beef, right? She's got a whole separate agenda here. Scholl admitted in the deposition, the [[01:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6849.12s)]
*  network did not know the truth. And as to televising the accusations, he said, we would have to [[01:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6854.16s)]
*  approach this with a great deal of transparency with viewers and say, look, we don't know the [[01:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6859.04s)]
*  truth. That's my understanding too, Stacey, that like, when you've got somebody making, you know, [[01:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6863.68s)]
*  whistleblower allegations like that, and you've got a strong denial on the other side, you [[01:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6869.12s)]
*  investigate it and you find a bunch of reasons to doubt the allegations, it's a judgment call [[01:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6873.44s)]
*  as to whether you tank the story entirely. But in some instances, you might put it on the air anyway. [[01:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6878.0s)]
*  Like if it's big enough and it's like serious enough, you might put it on the air anyway, [[01:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6884.96s)]
*  but you would have to outline all the doubts that had been found in your reporting about it so that [[01:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6888.88s)]
*  the viewers knew to keep a very healthy dose of skepticism on the allegations. I mean, you practice [[01:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6894.24s)]
*  in this area. Am I right? Yeah, absolutely. And that's really what the guy from standards was [[01:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6899.36s)]
*  saying is that if we're going to do this, we've got a, we've got a caveat with this and this and [[01:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6904.96s)]
*  this. And then it's worth saying, why are we even doing the story? And he acknowledges during one [[01:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6909.6s)]
*  of those internal calls to with Chris Hayes and his producers, Hey, we can get to the bottom of [[01:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6913.76s)]
*  this and we can find out. But by the time we find out, we're not going to want to do the story [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6918.56s)]
*  anymore. It's going to be too late. I mean, really just sort of acknowledging how they were rushing [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6922.56s)]
*  here. And, and I agree with you, Trump gets reelected. Yeah. I mean, the media, the media [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6926.56s)]
*  has an important job and I know it's got to be hard. And, and I've had cases that have come to [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6931.84s)]
*  me and I've started looking at them and I'm like, Oh, this is a great case. This is a great case. [[01:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6936.4800000000005s)]
*  But when you find out facts that tell you it's not, when you're in the media and you have, [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6940.8s)]
*  you think you have this great story, but then you find out facts that tell you that show to you that [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6946.4s)]
*  it's not, you have to stop. And I think you said it, it was just too good. They had gotten, [[01:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6950.4s)]
*  they really wanted this. I think Julia Ainsley and Jacob Sobovich, they had done this book on, [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6955.92s)]
*  or Sobovich had done a book on the child separation policies. They had won some awards [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6961.28s)]
*  for reporting in that this was their next immigration story. They wanted it so much [[01:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6965.36s)]
*  that even though their own sources, their own immigration lawyers in Georgia were saying, [[01:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6970.16s)]
*  we are not seeing it. Even though ICE was saying to his directories, even though this was not a [[01:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6974.96s)]
*  firsthand account, they just couldn't stop themselves from doing it. And then those text [[01:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6980.799999999999s)]
*  messages that you showed, some of those go into the night after the first night of reporting. [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6986.32s)]
*  And you have them even saying, gosh, I've got to know if it's true. I can't move on. I wonder [[01:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6991.2s)]
*  if it's true. Do we think that the attorneys that did talk to us and told us that they found one, [[01:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=6995.92s)]
*  do we think they conspired? I've heard mixed things about Don Wooten, the alleged whistleblower. [[01:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7001.68s)]
*  They are questioning it and they didn't stop. It's a hard job. But when you learn better, [[01:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7006.72s)]
*  when you know better, you do better. And they just didn't do that here. If it's okay, I wanted to [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7013.84s)]
*  real quickly, you mentioned how we had to meet that actual malice standard and we did that. It's [[01:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7018.56s)]
*  so hard. It is so hard. It's so hard. To get past summary judgment on actual malice. So I have to [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7022.8s)]
*  pat ourselves on the back for that for our team. But we did. Right, because you would have expected [[01:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7028.0s)]
*  this judge could have thrown your case out at summary judgment. And that's really what I think [[01:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7032.64s)]
*  led to the settlement, right? The judge did not throw out the case at summary judgment. In fact, [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7035.360000000001s)]
*  you got summary judgment on the critical facts of your case, which is it is not true that he is a [[01:57:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7038.88s)]
*  uterus collector. Right, right. We got, we got, it's so rare for a plaintiff to get summary [[01:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7044.08s)]
*  judgment. We got summary judgment on several of the statements being false as a matter of law. [[01:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7049.36s)]
*  And she said no evidence of mass hysterectomies, no evidence of high numbers of hysterectomies. [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7053.6s)]
*  And obviously he's not a uterus collector. But we had to prove actual malice here. And we were [[01:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7057.68s)]
*  allowed to go to the jury on that. If the case I continued, we'd be in trial right now or next week. [[01:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7062.24s)]
*  But we had to prove actual malice here, even though Dr. Amin is not a public figure, [[01:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7067.76s)]
*  because Georgia has a very strict anti-SLAPP statute, strategic lawsuit against public [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7071.76s)]
*  participation is what SLAPP stands for, for the viewers and listeners. And so when you have [[01:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7077.280000000001s)]
*  statements on air or in publications about issues of public concern, which this was deemed to be [[01:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7082.4800000000005s)]
*  that you have to reach that actual malice standard, regardless of public figure status. And so that's [[01:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7087.76s)]
*  why we had to do that. There's been some, we could get nerdy on the law. There's been a little bit of [[01:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7094.24s)]
*  changes since, since that happened. And I have some disagreement about how that was applied here, [[01:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7097.76s)]
*  but that's why it wasn't because he was a public figure, but because in this case, the court had [[01:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7101.68s)]
*  deemed this an issue of public concern. And so we had to meet that higher standard, which is [[01:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7106.8s)]
*  very, very hard. And I'm really proud of our team. Well, NBC saw it coming because once they lost [[01:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7111.84s)]
*  at summary judgment and you were barreling toward trial, I think they understood exactly how this [[01:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7118.320000000001s)]
*  was going to go over in front of a jury and you settled. And I've heard you say you're very happy [[01:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7123.4400000000005s)]
*  with the settlement. Can you add any color to that? Well, the settlement terms themselves are [[01:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7128.96s)]
*  confidential, so I really can't. But I can say that Dr. Amin is very happy to be able to move [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7134.08s)]
*  on from this. I mean, this is, we filed this case in the fall of 2021. So this has been going on [[01:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7139.36s)]
*  for a very long time for him. And so he's very glad to be able to move on from it and, and very [[01:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7144.4800000000005s)]
*  glad that, that you and some others have been interested in sharing his story because it's, [[01:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7149.68s)]
*  it's been so hurtful for him. And like I said, his staff and his family. And so to be able to, [[01:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7155.28s)]
*  to have the truth come out, to be able to get that, that accountability for the truth just [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7160.24s)]
*  means so much to him. And I appreciate you letting us tell that story. Of course. He's still practicing [[01:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7167.5199999999995s)]
*  now, right? He is, he is still practicing. He's good. He's, he is, I describe him. He is a doctor. [[01:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7172.799999999999s)]
*  He is a doctor. He is a doctor. He's a doctor. Other than when I told him he needed to wear [[01:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7180.4800000000005s)]
*  a business casual outfit, at least for his deposition, I've never seen the man not in [[01:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7186.56s)]
*  scrubs. We have a mediation or whatever we have. He's coming in and scrubs because he's, [[01:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7190.64s)]
*  he'll, he'll take a break and he'll go, he'll get a call. He'll have to go deliver a baby. [[01:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7195.360000000001s)]
*  He just wants to know, when can I get back to seeing patients? He loves it. He's really good [[01:59:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7199.4400000000005s)]
*  at it. The community, fortunately still loves him down there. He, he had some trouble for a while, [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7204.32s)]
*  but everybody, luckily it seems like everyone's come back around and he'll never know all the [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7211.679999999999s)]
*  naysayers that are out there, but he's very important to the community. He loves them and [[02:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7216.719999999999s)]
*  they love him. And yeah, all he wants to do is practice medicine. There never was a lawsuit [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7220.719999999999s)]
*  against the nurse, right? There actually is a pending lawsuit against her. We have a state [[02:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7225.84s)]
*  court case against Sinclair broadcasting and Don Wooten jointly. That's pending right now in Tift [[02:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7233.28s)]
*  County Superior Court. So that, that one is yet to be resolved. Okay. Yeah. I wondered about that [[02:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7240.0s)]
*  because I saw, she spoke out to the Guardian or at least the Guardian offered an article about her [[02:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7245.12s)]
*  in 2022. And she, she's blaming a very low dejected mental state on her time as a whistleblower saying [[02:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7251.04s)]
*  uh, post whistleblowing, I am on antidepressants at one time I was suicidal, couldn't pay the bill, [[02:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7261.4400000000005s)]
*  still can't pay the bills. My whole nursing career just plummeted. I'm back on food stamps. I'm back [[02:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7268.0s)]
*  on welfare. I'm back on Medicaid. I'm back trying to figure out how I'm going to make ends meet, [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7272.56s)]
*  et cetera. So what is she defending the lawsuit? Does she have counsel? [[02:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7278.0s)]
*  She is defending the lawsuit. She does have counsel. It's in a, we've got a procedural issue [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7284.16s)]
*  that we've got to work through before we get to discovery in that case. And so a lot is still sort [[02:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7288.96s)]
*  of paused, but I do think it's worthy of note that the government accountability project, which [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q4yqvNBm51E&t=7293.68s)]
