# BREAKING: Diddy Guilty on Lesser Charges, NOT Guilty on More Serious - Megyn Kelly Reacts
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [July 02, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y)
*  Good morning, everyone. There is breaking news out of a federal courthouse in New York. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=0.0s)]
*  I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show where Sean Combs has been found not guilty [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=8.24s)]
*  on the majority of counts against him and has been found guilty of only the two least [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=14.76s)]
*  serious crimes that he was charged with. There is little question that this is a defeat for [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=20.96s)]
*  the prosecution. The two counts on which he's been found guilty are transportation to engage [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=26.76s)]
*  in prostitution. There were two counts of it with respect to Cassie Ventura and Jane, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=32.32s)]
*  who testified under a pseudonym, and he has been found not guilty on racketeering, [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=38.84s)]
*  not guilty on sex trafficking with respect to Cassie Ventura and with respect to Jane. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=43.64s)]
*  Both of those sex trafficking counts required 15 years minimum in prison. The RICO count that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=49.48s)]
*  he's been found not guilty of was a sentence of 20 to life, though it didn't have a mandatory [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=58.12s)]
*  minimum. So the sex trafficking ones were extremely serious, 15 years minimum, and he's [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  escaped liability on both of those. He's escaped criminal guilt on both of those. It was going to [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=68.47999999999999s)]
*  be a miracle. It was going to be an obvious jury nullification if he escaped a guilty verdict on [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=76.92s)]
*  transportation to engage in prostitution. The evidence was overwhelming that he did that. There [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=82.84s)]
*  were receipts. There was testimony by the escorts. It was very clear that Sean Combs did pay these [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=88.56s)]
*  male escorts to cross state lines and to come into his various hotel rooms and have sex with [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=94.56s)]
*  his girlfriends, Cassie and Jane, and they had him dead to rights on that. I mean, he really [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=100.84s)]
*  should have pled guilty on those. And I've been saying all along, if they found him not guilty on [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=106.72s)]
*  those, it would prove that this has been a total nullification of the jury. He was a famous man, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=110.92s)]
*  and they didn't want to find him guilty because it's very clear he did those two. It is stunning [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=116.52s)]
*  that he managed to escape a guilty verdict on RICO, less stunning on RICO, but on sex trafficking, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=121.64s)]
*  where the evidence was just overwhelming on the fact that he did threaten at least Cassie and [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=127.92s)]
*  Jane over and over again. He beat both women when they would not comply with his demands. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=136.48s)]
*  But clearly what we're seeing here is the jury bought and believed the defense argument that [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=143.2s)]
*  these women had agency, that these women were not forced to do anything. The defense got up there [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=150.64s)]
*  and argued that they were swingers, that they were engaging in a swinger lifestyle, notwithstanding [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=156.64s)]
*  the beatings it took to get them to comply in certain instances. The jury clearly bought that. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=165.6s)]
*  There was testimony that would be helpful for the defense. I don't mean to scoff at the conclusion [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=173.68s)]
*  entirely. There was testimony to support a not guilty, including text messages from Cassie Ventura [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=178.48000000000002s)]
*  saying, I can't wait to freak off. I love our freak offs when we both want them. And testimony [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=184.72s)]
*  that Cassie stayed in part because she loved the lifestyle. She loved the trappings of life with [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=190.0s)]
*  Diddy. And Jane is still having her apartment paid for by Sean Combs to this moment. And [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=196.88s)]
*  there definitely could be a takeaway that Jane was in it because she wanted the apartment and [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=204.96s)]
*  she wanted to be connected with somebody famous and rich and not because she had any fear for [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=210.16s)]
*  her life or otherwise or retribution if she submitted. New York Times reporting here, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=216.48s)]
*  caller from inside the courtroom, Sean Combs is smiling as he shook one of his lawyer's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=222.56s)]
*  hands and turned again to look at his family. He put his hands together in prayer and mouth, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=228.16s)]
*  thank you. Thank you at the jury. That's the right thing to say, Sean Combs. He pumped his right fist. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  Yep. This is exactly the right attitude for Sean Combs who just got away with serious [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  felonies in my view. He's guilty as sin in my view. And this jury just gave him a total pass. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=244.4s)]
*  They bought Mark Agnifilo's argument, it appears, the same one that did not work for Agnifilo in the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=251.20000000000002s)]
*  NXIVM sex cult case out of Albany, New York, in which he went in there and said, these women, [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=257.52s)]
*  we don't do sex cults. Women are powerful. Women make their own decisions. These women up in this [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=262.72s)]
*  other case chose to have themselves branded. No one made them with this guy's initials. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=268.96000000000004s)]
*  And he tried the same thing here, but with a much, much better result. This is a win for Sean [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=273.6s)]
*  Diddy Combs. There's no question about it. The minimum charge or the charges likely on [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=279.12s)]
*  this particular count are far less serious. It calls for up to 10 years in prison. There's no [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  way he's going to get 10 years in prison on these two unless you have a judge who's very, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=294.24s)]
*  very angry for some reason. We looked at the federal sentencing guidelines, which are just [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=298.48s)]
*  recommendations. The judge doesn't have to follow them. He can go any place between zero and 10. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=305.36s)]
*  But we deduced that he has an offense level of about 26 points, which calls for a sentence of [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=310.40000000000003s)]
*  5.25 years to 6.5 years in prison. The base offense level for this crime, we deduced to be [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=317.44s)]
*  about 14. This is all on a sliding scale. Plus you add another four levels because the offense [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=325.44s)]
*  may have involved coercion anyway. And then another four for causing another person to [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=330.16s)]
*  engage in a sexual act. So if they believe that if this judge says that's what happened, he could be [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=334.96s)]
*  facing five or six years in prison on each count, they would be likely to run consecutive, although [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=339.92s)]
*  it's possible the judge could say they run one after the other or to get their congruence. So [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=345.92s)]
*  we'll see. Likely to run at the same time is my view. There's no way he's getting more than five [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=352.72s)]
*  years in prison. But the sentencing won't happen today. That'll happen, I believe, at another [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=357.76000000000005s)]
*  hearing. I want to bring in Phil Holloway, who's been watching this case. You know him from our [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=364.48s)]
*  coverage of the Fannie Willis matter. He's a trial attorney down in Atlanta, Georgia. And Phil, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=369.6s)]
*  you had been feeling and predicting that we were headed for a likely NG. I realize it's not a full [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=375.12s)]
*  not guilty, but anybody who tells you this isn't a win for Diddy is lying to you. This is an [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=382.96s)]
*  absolute win for him. And that's why he's pumping his fist and smiling today. Your thoughts? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=387.28000000000003s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. It's always great to be with you here, Megan. Look, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=392.56s)]
*  this is about many things, but at the heart of this verdict, I think is reasonable down. I mean, [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=397.6s)]
*  all it takes for a jury to find someone not guilty is one doubt for which a reason can be attached. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=404.24s)]
*  And if you have statements made by victims, you've read some of them in your opening just now, where [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=413.92s)]
*  these alleged victims had expressed a willingness and a desire to participate in some of these [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=421.6s)]
*  things. It is a very difficult thing for a prosecutor sometimes to prove beyond a reasonable [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=428.4s)]
*  doubt that despite those statements and despite that evidence, they are in fact victims. And so [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=434.56s)]
*  the jury is probably going to leave there thinking, you know what, he's a slimy person, [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=442.08s)]
*  he's a terrible person, he's probably guilty of all of these things. But the prosecution was just [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=447.12s)]
*  unable to prove to us beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the crimes as to the rest of [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=452.8s)]
*  the counts. And look, whatever the judge does give him in terms of sentencing, there's no parole to [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=459.12s)]
*  speak of in the federal system. And it's entirely possible that these are not run consecutively or [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=464.48s)]
*  concurrently. They could in fact be stacked potentially. And there's no reason to think [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=471.36s)]
*  that the judge is going to stay necessarily within the sentencing guidelines. It's very possible that [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=476.16s)]
*  the judge maxes out whatever is possible on what he's been convicted of. So for a man of his age, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=482.32s)]
*  you know, even a five or six or seven year prison sentence in the federal system is not insignificant [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=490.15999999999997s)]
*  at all. Now I do agree with you on balance, this was a win. He's already been in custody for, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=496.32s)]
*  you know, 10 months or so I think it is now and he will get credit for that. So [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=503.44s)]
*  for Diddy and for his team, there is something of a light at the end of his tunnel, but [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=508.32s)]
*  it's not over yet. The sentencing could still be relatively severe under the circumstances. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=513.2s)]
*  The my team's informing me if there are no enhancements, no enhancements to the sent to [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=520.4s)]
*  the bare minimum sentencing under the transportation to engage in prostitution charges. One conviction [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=525.6800000000001s)]
*  on this charge would be 15 to 21 months. Two counts convicted under two counts, which is what he [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=532.4s)]
*  has been is 21 to 27 months. So about two years, but we believe that there will be enhancements [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=539.6s)]
*  given the level that he was accused of coercion and so on. So we'll see. So we're looking at [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=546.08s)]
*  probably two, I mean, it technically could be up to 10 years, but it's not going to be that because [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=551.6s)]
*  he has a criminal record, but he did not. It's not so great that he served jail for more than 30 [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=555.52s)]
*  days or got to the point where this would be held against him. In other words, they don't count his [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=561.84s)]
*  criminal history against him unless he was sentenced to more than a year of probation or [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=566.16s)]
*  30 days in jail on prior offenses and he wasn't. So it's as if he had no prior offenses. New York [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=569.76s)]
*  Times reporting that Mark Agnifilo, Sean Combs's lead lawyer has asked that his client be released [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=576.64s)]
*  ahead of sentencing now that he is no longer facing sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=580.96s)]
*  charges, much more serious charges than the ones that he was convicted on. He's saying Combs is not [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=586.64s)]
*  a flight risk because he does not have access to his passport or his plane. This is his first [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=592.24s)]
*  conviction, he says, and it's a prostitution offense. And so he should be released on appropriate [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=597.04s)]
*  conditions. Agnifilo said the lawyer is asking that Mr. Combs returned to his home in Miami Beach, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=601.12s)]
*  Florida. That's very interesting. And he's probably going to win that. I think we'll see. Bringing in [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=605.92s)]
*  now Arthur Idala, famed criminal defense attorney, but also has a history as a prosecutor back when [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=611.36s)]
*  he was younger. Just got off of the Harvey Weinstein trial himself. And your reaction, [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=616.72s)]
*  Arthur, to the breaking news that Sean Combs basically won this case, but for two prostitution [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=622.32s)]
*  counts. It's a tremendous, it's a tremendous victory. And here's why I'm personally happy. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=626.88s)]
*  The prosecutor who brought the case, Damian Williams, I don't think he was a good guy. I [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=632.48s)]
*  don't think he was a good U.S. attorney in the Southern District. I think his personal ambitions [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=639.44s)]
*  just clouded his judgment. I mean, he was going around telling people quietly that he was [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=644.4000000000001s)]
*  positioning himself to run for president of the United States and he wanted to bring down Combs. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  He wanted to bring on the mayor of the city of New York. That was his ambition. And the conviction [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=655.2800000000001s)]
*  rates are so high in the Southern District that once you get indicted, it's over 90% when you go [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=660.5600000000001s)]
*  to trial. So this is a huge victory for the defense, for Sean, because there's no mandatory [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=667.92s)]
*  minimum. You know, when I spoke yesterday, all these other counts, the judge, if it was his uncle, [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=677.28s)]
*  has to send him to prison. But that's not the case here. However, I don't think this judge is going [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=681.76s)]
*  to give him a walk in the park either. He's definitely giving him jail time. The judge is [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=688.4799999999999s)]
*  allowed to take into consideration all of the factors he heard during this trial, even the ones [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=693.12s)]
*  he was acquitted of. I was involved in a case where it was a murder case in federal court. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=698.88s)]
*  The guy was acquitted of the murder, but there was a drug aspect of it that he was convicted of. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=704.08s)]
*  He should have gotten three or four years and the judge gave him the maximum [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=709.52s)]
*  with all the enhancements and she's put on the record. I'm taking into account all the facts I [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=712.96s)]
*  heard about the murder. So Sean Combs could be home in a very short amount of time or you can, [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=718.4s)]
*  you know, I think it's up to 10 years that he can be sentenced to. So if you're the defense attorney [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=723.92s)]
*  though, Megan, you're very satisfied with the outcome of this case. You're thrilled. You can't [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=730.3199999999999s)]
*  say thrilled because your client did get found guilty on two counts, but you're thrilled. This [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=739.12s)]
*  is a huge, huge win. This guy was looking at life in prison, life in prison if he got convicted on [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=743.12s)]
*  the Rico count and those sex trafficking counts, two of them, one for Cassie, one for Jane, [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=749.92s)]
*  are no joke. 15 years minimum required. Mandatory. Right. The judge has no discretion. So, you know, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=754.8s)]
*  he managed to skate on both of those. This coming in now that the defense, again, trying to argue [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=764.4s)]
*  for his freedom pending sentencing, they suggested a $1 million bond. The judge had rejected that [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=770.88s)]
*  pending trial. They asked repeatedly to get Sean Combs out on bail pending trial and the judge [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=776.8s)]
*  repeatedly said no. The government here vehemently opposing Sean Combs' release. The lead prosecutor, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=781.2s)]
*  Maureen Comey, saying the defense is underplaying the seriousness of the conviction and is urging [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=787.92s)]
*  the judge to keep him detained. What kind of factors would go into that analysis, guys, [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=792.56s)]
*  do you know? Like when the judge, you got a conviction, but it's two prostitution counts. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=798.48s)]
*  I mean, they are felony counts, but I don't know. Would you normally detain a guy like this? [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=802.5600000000001s)]
*  Megan, all I can say is this. If they put it forth, the same bail package that they have put forth [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=808.72s)]
*  where he was going to have to stay in his house, pay for his own security, obviously have ankle [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=814.4s)]
*  bondage, have no electronic devices in his house except like a landline old school telephone to [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=819.44s)]
*  communicate with people. It would be so beyond the pale. It would be such an injustice for this [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=825.44s)]
*  judge not to give him bail under those conditions based on this conviction. If Sean Combs or anyone [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=832.48s)]
*  went in and pled guilty to this count, you would be looking at a probably a non-jail disposition. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=841.2s)]
*  You'd probably be looking at some form of probation. I don't think he's going to get [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=847.12s)]
*  probation because of the jail, the note of writing, who he is, but he absolutely, he's not [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=852.72s)]
*  a danger to society under those bail conditions. He's not a flight risk under those bail conditions. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=857.52s)]
*  He's no longer facing mandatory jail time. So the judge definitely, definitely should be giving him [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=863.2s)]
*  some sort of bail package. Well, right now, the New York Times reporting the judge said he needs [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=870.8000000000001s)]
*  time to consider the law before making a decision on whether Combs can walk out of the courthouse [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=875.6s)]
*  today. He's been incarcerated since September of 2024. I mean, how much time can the judge take [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=880.8s)]
*  here? He sends him back to prison. It's like, I don't know, how much time is it going to take? [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=888.16s)]
*  If I can feel that when I have a little bit different take on it, Megan, look, he no longer [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=893.5999999999999s)]
*  has the presumption of innocence, right? At least with respect to the charges he was convicted of. [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=898.88s)]
*  So there's no right to bail like there might be arguably a right to bail in a pre-trial situation, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=904.0s)]
*  at least if you meet the criteria. In this case, the judge already knows whether or not he's [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=912.32s)]
*  thinking about sending Combs to prison for some extended period of time. And if he's going to [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=917.84s)]
*  send him to prison, there's no real, it doesn't really make sense to go ahead and release him [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=924.16s)]
*  now. If he's going to be giving him some additional jail time, why let him out? Go ahead and let him [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=930.32s)]
*  begin serving that now. He's already convicted. The judge has heard all of the evidence of all of the [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=935.44s)]
*  terrible things that Combs has done during his life, and particularly with respect to some of these [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=944.8000000000001s)]
*  women, the domestic violence, the drugs, all of it. He's heard all of this stuff. And so if he is [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=950.72s)]
*  thinking, look, if I'm the judge and if I'm thinking, okay, I'm going to be sending him, [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=957.6s)]
*  let's just say it's going to be a three or four year prison sentence. I'm going to say, no, you're [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=961.6s)]
*  not going to get out on bail. You're going to go ahead and stay in custody. We'll sentence you next [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=965.6s)]
*  month. But that way this time is counting towards the overall sentence. On the other hand, if the [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=969.6s)]
*  judge is thinking, okay, I'm going to let him out on probation, well, and if he lets him out on bond, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=975.6800000000001s)]
*  then that could be an indicator that the judge is thinking about probation or some lower jail term. [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=980.5600000000001s)]
*  I don't think the judge is thinking about a bare minimum jail term, maybe not the maximum, [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=985.92s)]
*  probably something in the middle. And in my view, that would weigh in favor of keeping him in custody [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=990.7199999999999s)]
*  denying the bail package. It doesn't do much good to let somebody go home to Miami Beach [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=997.4399999999999s)]
*  just to order them back to prison a few months later, at least in my view. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1002.24s)]
*  No, no, that's a great point. And I will tell you from what my clients tell me, the hardest [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1006.0s)]
*  part about going to prison is going to prison is actually those first days. And right now, [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1011.44s)]
*  believe it or not, Sean Combs has a routine. It may have been thrown off for the trial, [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1016.96s)]
*  but he knows all the people. He knows the guards. He knows the commissary. He knows the work. [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1021.7600000000001s)]
*  So he's in a relatively comfort zone as opposed to him leaving and then going back, [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1025.76s)]
*  which makes things more difficult. However, these charges in the world of federal criminal law [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1031.68s)]
*  are pretty minute. I mean, it is a felony. It's not the same as like hiring a prostitute and [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1038.1599999999999s)]
*  like getting caught in hotel room with her, right? Transportation to engage in prostitution as a [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1046.3999999999999s)]
*  federal crime is a felony with real jail time attached to it. So this is not that petty, Annie. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1050.6399999999999s)]
*  It's not as small as it could be. But yeah, compared to the other charges he was facing, [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1056.6399999999999s)]
*  here's one other bit of color for you. New York Times reporting. This won't surprise you. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1060.96s)]
*  Combs's body language is totally different from yesterday when he seemed crestfallen and grim [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1065.68s)]
*  after the jury said it had reached a verdict on four of the five counts. Now acquitted of the [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1070.96s)]
*  most serious charges, Mr. Combs appears energetic and relieved. Can we just talk about here's the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1076.24s)]
*  picture? Here's a sketch artist's picture of Combs yesterday of the grimness. And I'm sure [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1082.0800000000002s)]
*  we'll get one today of him looking much more relieved. I'm so confused about here's a little [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1088.24s)]
*  bit more New York Times with a touch of levity. The judge said he assumed Combs would not want [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1094.88s)]
*  to return to the Brooklyn jail where he had he has been held. Combs shook his head vigorously [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1099.2800000000002s)]
*  and put his hands together in prayer. Oh, it's all just so chummy inside the courtroom for this [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1104.88s)]
*  disgusting pervert female abuser who I can't believe is about to roam our streets again. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1109.6000000000001s)]
*  I'm sorry, I'm disgusted by this verdict. This is fucking ridiculous. I just find it absolutely [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1116.96s)]
*  outrageous the amount of crime that this guy just got away with. I believe he committed arson. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1122.1599999999999s)]
*  He definitely battered Cassie. He battered Jane too. The statute of limitations for battery in [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1126.72s)]
*  Los Angeles, California is one year, one year. So if they didn't charge him for battery within [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1132.72s)]
*  one year and they couldn't because he bought the tape and it remained hidden thanks to those [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1138.6399999999999s)]
*  security guards out there, then they could never charge him with that again. There's no question. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1143.04s)]
*  He dragged her back into that hotel room. Why wasn't that kidnapping? They only talked about [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1148.56s)]
*  the kidnapping of Capricorn Clark, who was his sort of main assistant because she said he grabbed her [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1152.8s)]
*  and made her go with him over to Kid Cudi's house. There's no question he broke into Kid Cudi's house [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1161.12s)]
*  in my view and that he opened up the Christmas residence and locked the door in and made a threat. [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1166.1599999999999s)]
*  There's no question in my mind he was behind the arson of Kid Cudi's car and there was proof, [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1170.56s)]
*  plenty of proof to prove that. No, okay, there was female fingerprints they found on that, [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1175.76s)]
*  the fire bomb that was left there, the Molotov cocktail, and the prosecution said there's no [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1180.96s)]
*  question he didn't do it himself, but he said, I'm going to bomb Kid Cudi's car. It's in writing. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1184.8s)]
*  Cassie Ventura emailed her mother saying, oh my God, he's threatening to bomb his car. And two [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1191.1200000000001s)]
*  weeks later it got bombed. Oh, gee, it was just some third party who also had, it's just like the [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1195.2s)]
*  proof was there, the beatings, the threats that if they didn't go back into those rooms and get [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1200.64s)]
*  off with these male escorts that they were going to get beaten. The testimony from that Daniel [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1205.76s)]
*  Phillip, who was the male escort, who heard Combs abusing Cassie behind the door and she was [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1210.24s)]
*  screaming, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, as he heard him slapping her, get back out there. She came back [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1216.64s)]
*  out, she was shaking, she got back into the escort's lap, physically shaking. She was so scared to the [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1221.44s)]
*  point where that guy couldn't perform sexually because this was so horrifying to him. What in the [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1226.72s)]
*  actual F went on in there? Wait, let me just for one second, Phil, because let me just get Megan [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1232.88s)]
*  more pissed off if I may. So if the judge gives him a reasonable sentence, let's say he sends him [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1240.4s)]
*  to five years, okay, and he's already got time in, and with a halfway house he's out in three. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1247.28s)]
*  How quick is he going to be accepted back into that Hollywood scene, blah, blah, blah, blah? Or [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1252.48s)]
*  do you think people will still keep him out of arms lane? I mean, look, I will make it my personal [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1259.2s)]
*  mission to maintain his humiliation in the minds of all Americans. There's no question he's fallen [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1266.0s)]
*  as this revered figure for a large portion of America, but he also has diehard fans who want [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1273.92s)]
*  to pretend this is a Johnny Depp situation, you know, where he was wrongfully accused, that's my [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1280.0s)]
*  own view, by somebody who was out to get him, who played the victim when in fact she was abusive. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1285.68s)]
*  This is not that situation. This is not. Cassandra Ventura was an extremely sympathetic witness who [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1290.64s)]
*  was not some powerful, I'm going to play a kid-cutty against John Combs. She was traumatized by this [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1296.72s)]
*  guy. She remains suicidal to this day, given all that was done to her. Listen to this. I'm like, [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1303.04s)]
*  I almost don't even want to read these updates. New York Times, Sean Combs is now on his knees, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1309.44s)]
*  his elbows on the chair where he was sitting, his head buried. He appeared to be praying. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1314.8s)]
*  He started a round of applause, which was echoed by his family who are jubilant. Yay, yay. We only [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1323.04s)]
*  have an abuser and solicitor of prostitutes in the family, not a sex trafficker. Sean Combs's [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  supporters and family are now clapping and whistling for his legal team who are all embracing [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1336.08s)]
*  each other. They actually did get a victory and that's different. They should be hugging. Go ahead, [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1341.36s)]
*  Phil. The judge is allowing that kind of thing in the court. Yeah, I'm surprised about that also. [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1346.24s)]
*  Yeah, what's that about? Or maybe the judge is all back. There's no place in the courtroom for this [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1350.72s)]
*  because, look, regardless of whether or not you agree or disagree with the verdict, there's a [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1356.3999999999999s)]
*  certain dignity and decorum that's appropriate for courtrooms. In federal courts, judges are [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1362.16s)]
*  famous for enforcing it, oftentimes much more so than at the state level. But look, [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1369.68s)]
*  back to your whole thing. This is a Biden appointee, so who knows about the dignity required. Sorry, [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1374.4s)]
*  keep going. Back to your dismay with the jury's verdict. Look, juries are always wild card. You [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1379.28s)]
*  got 12 people in there that come from different backgrounds, different walks of life. They have [[00:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1386.24s)]
*  different political philosophies. They have different religious philosophies. They have [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1390.64s)]
*  their own biases, whether they say they can leave them outside the courtroom or not. They bring them [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1394.88s)]
*  in there and they analyze and they view things. And sometimes jurors are just stupid. Sometimes [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1399.2800000000002s)]
*  they're just dumb. Sometimes they're not capable of understanding the law or following the judge's [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1404.72s)]
*  instructions. So you factor all of that in there and what you've got is a system where, guess what? [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1409.68s)]
*  After doing this almost 40 years, I have come to the conclusion that you cannot trust jurors to [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1415.52s)]
*  ever get it right, whether you're a prosecutor or whether you're a defense lawyer. Jurors and [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1422.0s)]
*  juries cannot be trusted to get it right. They get it wrong a lot. And that is what usually brings [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1426.8799999999999s)]
*  people to the bargaining table to come up with plea deals, like we have seen maybe in the Koberger [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1434.48s)]
*  case coming up today. But look, you just can't trust a jury ever to get to the right result. [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1439.9199999999998s)]
*  Sometimes they do, but a lot of times, unfortunately, they don't. And that cuts [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1447.12s)]
*  both ways for the prosecution and the defense. I'm so confused on what the jury has done here. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1450.9599999999998s)]
*  Like when you factor in the notes we got yesterday, Arthur, we get a note saying they reached a [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1457.12s)]
*  verdict on counts two through five, but they couldn't agree on count one, which was the [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1463.52s)]
*  racketeering conspiracy. Now we find out that at that time, we assume it didn't change. They [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1466.96s)]
*  thought he was guilty of the prostitution stuff, but they did not think that he was a sex trafficker [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1472.16s)]
*  who forced Cassie and Jane to perform sex acts under threat of coercion or fraud. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1476.8s)]
*  And yet they were about to be a hung jury on the RICO count. Now, I don't get it. And then today, [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1484.16s)]
*  I guess the holdouts who said, I think he's guilty of RICO, this morning turned around and said, [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1490.4s)]
*  all right, he's not, he's not, because they acquitted him of that. I don't get it. Because [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1494.88s)]
*  to prove, how was there a juror who said he didn't sex traffic, but he might be guilty of RICO? I [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1498.72s)]
*  guess somebody was looking at the RICO statute saying maybe he did do the arson, maybe he did [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1507.2s)]
*  do the drug selling. Right. The other predicate, right. There were other predicate acts that they [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1512.3200000000002s)]
*  didn't have to be the ones he was charged with. They were ones outside of the charge crimes [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1518.0s)]
*  that they could have said those were predicate acts and therefore he's guilty of the racketeering. [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1522.72s)]
*  But I'm happy he didn't, you know, look, I got to know, I'm with you about who Sean Combs is as a [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1528.96s)]
*  person, but as someone who works in the system, this RICO law has really been abused as of late. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1535.3600000000001s)]
*  And because of what it is, an original intent was to what they're using it for now. So I'm happy [[00:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1541.92s)]
*  that this didn't play out. Or maybe they were confused on, well, even if he did do some of the [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1548.48s)]
*  other predicate acts, is his business, which is music and recording and taking care of other [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1555.92s)]
*  artists and clothing and alcohol and all of this stuff, is that really a criminal enterprise? Or [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1561.6s)]
*  is it a legitimate enterprise that Mr. Combs individually did some criminality with? So it [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1567.28s)]
*  probably got a little confusing, a little mixed up. I'm happy maybe this will have a chilling [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1574.88s)]
*  effect on prosecutors across the country to just be throwing these RICO counts around where they [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1578.96s)]
*  are not really deserved. But Megan, it also goes to, you never know what happens when a jury goes [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1585.6000000000001s)]
*  out overnight and they go home and they go to sleep and they think about it. And let's face it, [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1593.2s)]
*  the Sean Combs stuff is popping up all over everyone's phone in the back of the cab. [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1597.5200000000002s)]
*  So who knows what they heard, who knows what they absorbed and what changed, but something [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1602.0800000000002s)]
*  changed really quickly. It felt like they were in there and it's three o'clock this afternoon. [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1607.04s)]
*  I mean, they came in, they must have taken one hour and it was over. [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1611.3600000000001s)]
*  No, and they were not sequestered. So they had access to their friends and family and who knows [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1614.4s)]
*  how that went and whose input, if any, they took during that timeframe. I want to say this, [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1619.6000000000001s)]
*  this just happened inside the courtroom. The court, the Times reporting, the court is adjourning [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1624.3200000000002s)]
*  for a few hours while the judge considers the arguments from Mr. Combs as lawyers and prosecutors [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1630.64s)]
*  about whether he should be released. Inner City Press, which is an organization that's been [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1635.1200000000001s)]
*  reporting on this from the beginning, says, yes, okay, that proposal, wait a couple hours, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1639.68s)]
*  give me a couple hours. That makes sense. Mr. Combs does not want to go back to the detention [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1644.3200000000002s)]
*  center. He is shaking his head. So something about at 1 p.m. will convene and I'll let the parties [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1648.5600000000002s)]
*  know. So I'm not sure exactly whether he gives the decision at one or they're just going to [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1656.0s)]
*  reconvene at one. Megan, what's happening right now is a very young, inexperienced judge is now [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1660.4s)]
*  going in the Southern District of New York where there are literally judges there appointed. [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1666.32s)]
*  I think rolling back to George H.W. Bush, there's definitely a bunch of Clinton employees, [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1671.04s)]
*  meaning people who have been on the bench for 35, 40 years, and he is going to have his one or two [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1675.2s)]
*  mentors and he's going to their chambers or picking their brains somehow or another and [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1680.56s)]
*  say, what do you think I should do not to embarrass myself? Because it always comes down to [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1685.2s)]
*  covering your own butt with these judges, in my opinion. And then that's how he's going to make [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1690.24s)]
*  it. He's not looking up any case law. There's no case law on this. It's his discretion. You know [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1695.28s)]
*  what the case law is? It's totally in his discretion. So he's going to go and ask Judge Lewis Kaplan, [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1699.8400000000001s)]
*  who was the one who tried the Trump case. He's going to go look at all these famous, the guy [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1705.3600000000001s)]
*  who just did the Menendez case, Judge Stein. Those are both Clinton appointees. They've been [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1710.64s)]
*  around for decades. And he'll say, what do you think? What do you think? What do you think? And [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1716.64s)]
*  then he'll do whatever he thinks is in his best interest. So what do you think before he does it? [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1720.24s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead, Phil. Yeah, you go. He's exactly correct. That's what the judge is doing. He's [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1725.5200000000002s)]
*  just going back and asking another judge, what am I supposed to do under these circumstances? [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1730.88s)]
*  And I bet the advice that he gets is something along the lines of, look, do you think you're [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1735.2800000000002s)]
*  going to send him to prison for any length of time? If the answer is yes, maybe consider keeping [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1739.36s)]
*  him in jail. If you're not sure that you're going to send him to prison, maybe let him go on house [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1744.7199999999998s)]
*  arrest until you figure that out. Or maybe you already know that you're not going to send him [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1750.7199999999998s)]
*  to any significant prison, in which case, you know, that would make sense to go ahead and let [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1754.6399999999999s)]
*  him out. But I think the best advice that any other judge could give this newbie judge would be that, [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1759.12s)]
*  look, keep him in jail if you think you're going to send him back to prison. Because once you let [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1765.52s)]
*  him out, you're going to start getting all kinds of motions to delay report dates, to delay this, [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1772.08s)]
*  to delay that. And it's just going to open up a big can of worms that maybe you don't want to open. [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1777.92s)]
*  So if you're going to send him to prison, leave him be where he is right now. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1783.12s)]
*  And what about you guys? Does this even factor in the safety of these women? What about the safety [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1787.76s)]
*  of Cassie Ventura and Jane and Mia, who is another woman who testified against him under a pseudonym, [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1796.24s)]
*  but he knows very well who she is and who all these women are. And I'm sorry, but this is a man, [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1802.0s)]
*  I believe, blew up another man's car because he was dating Combs's girlfriend. I still have [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1807.44s)]
*  questions about how Combs's first wife died. I don't have evidence to show he killed her. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1815.2s)]
*  She died of pneumonia, but it was very suspicious. And if you believe the draft diary, the alleged [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1820.0s)]
*  diary that hit YouTube, her friends, the dead wife's friends believe he had something to do with it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1825.76s)]
*  He was involved in shooting someone in the face in a nightclub. And that victim says he did it, [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1833.52s)]
*  even though another man went to prison for it. But that man is saying Diddy paid him off to take the [[00:30:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1839.92s)]
*  rap. And we've heard weeks now seven weeks of testimony about how he's beaten these women to [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1845.04s)]
*  a pulp when he was allegedly in love with them, not when they were taking the stand in a federal [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1851.6s)]
*  trial against him trying to get him locked up for the rest of his life. Does the judge consider that [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1858.0s)]
*  at all, Arthur, that he may be a danger if you let him out to these women? It's the primary thing [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1863.36s)]
*  that he's going to consider. The two primary things are danger to society and risk of flight. [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1869.44s)]
*  Phil is 100% correct. I mean, if the judge is thinking about keeping him and sentencing him [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1876.3200000000002s)]
*  to jail time, and I look, I've been wrong more times than I've been right. I'm going to be shocked [[00:31:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1882.16s)]
*  if he sentences him to like time served and five years probation. But you never know. But yes, [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1886.8s)]
*  dangerousness. Absolutely. That's why I think if he does let him out, I think he's gonna, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1893.04s)]
*  he should severely limit his ability to communicate outside of his like lawyering [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1899.92s)]
*  and his immediate family with a landline phone that can be monitored. But but if human instinct [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1905.76s)]
*  or common sense is going to play a role. I think it's fair to say that Sean had the life scared [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1913.76s)]
*  out of him like literally the life scared out of him because this judge, if he in the prosecutor [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1919.2s)]
*  ran the table, I don't know if Sean Combs was ever going to see the light of day. So, you know, [[00:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1924.16s)]
*  if I'm his lawyer, and I've been in this position where I've gotten people cleared of major, major [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1929.2s)]
*  crimes, and I said, Listen, the only way I'm going to come and hit you in the head with a bat is if [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1933.52s)]
*  you ever get in trouble again, because don't tell me I put my family aside, I put my life aside to [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1937.2s)]
*  save your backside, and you're going to do anything like this again. I imagine there's going to be a [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1941.76s)]
*  long term relationship between Mark Agnifilo and Sean Combs. And Mark is going to do everything he [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1946.32s)]
*  can to make sure that Sean at the very least, his power is about to end. He did. He's just a cog [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1950.8799999999999s)]
*  in the wheel of the Sean Combs empire. He's nothing to Sean Combs. He'll be grateful to him. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1958.96s)]
*  He's not gonna have ongoing control over Sean Combs. No one has control over Sean Combs. That's [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1963.76s)]
*  what we learned in this case, Phil, that he's the whole alleged enterprise was set up to treat him [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1968.6399999999999s)]
*  like he was God. There was testimony from the one woman who worked for him that she was the one, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1975.6s)]
*  she had to be available 24 seven. She was not allowed to sleep with a lock on her door in his [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1981.9199999999998s)]
*  home. Whereas all the male employees could, the security guards, they could, but her lock had to [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1986.24s)]
*  stay undone and he would go in there and she said, sexually assault her. I realized these things are [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1991.9199999999998s)]
*  complicated. Was it? Did she say no at the time? Was she overwhelmed that it was Sean Combs and she [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=1998.6399999999999s)]
*  didn't say anything? Is that fair to hold against him if she didn't? Well, all that's complicated. [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2003.44s)]
*  My point is simply everybody was there to serve Sean Combs and the reason he's behaved with impunity [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2007.52s)]
*  for all this time is because everyone around him has let him that that hotel intercontinental [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2014.24s)]
*  security guard took the money. The head of security blessed it. He took 50 grand and he gave 50 grand [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2020.0s)]
*  to the underling who then split his 50 with another guy. There was only one honest guy of [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2029.2s)]
*  the bunch who didn't take the money. The first guy on scene at the hotel didn't take the money, [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2034.56s)]
*  but did take out his phone and videotaped the hotel surveillance cameras because I, he said he [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2039.92s)]
*  wanted to show it to his wife, but I'm sure he had a little feeling someone else might take the money. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2046.48s)]
*  That's the only reason CNN years later got this tape and we and these jurors saw who Sean Combs [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2051.36s)]
*  really is. So it's just, I just don't think the lawyer's not going to have ongoing influence [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2060.2400000000002s)]
*  over this. Look at this guy, this thug. He's going to be thrilled he's out and if anything, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2066.0s)]
*  I feel like he's going to be feeling empowered that he's Sean effing Diddy Combs and he got away [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2071.92s)]
*  again with felonies. But the judge could have control over him. I mean, I don't want to speak [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2078.64s)]
*  at a turn, but the judge may be able to sentence him to five years, don't count consecutively, [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2085.36s)]
*  or three years of probation. He may be able to be on probation for 10 years where, you know, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2092.56s)]
*  federal probation could be pretty intensive. You know, you have to report once a week, [[00:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2098.08s)]
*  you have to, I mean, they could go to your house anytime unannounced, they can give you a curfew [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2103.2799999999997s)]
*  the judge gives you a curfew or not. Some 28 year old probation officer can tell Sean Combs, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2108.48s)]
*  I want you home every night at eight o'clock. You can leave at eight o'clock in the morning. [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2114.56s)]
*  And I really only want you to do in work events. If you want to leave the jurisdiction of the [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2118.08s)]
*  Southern District of New York, which is basically the five boroughs a little bit upstate, but it's [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2122.8s)]
*  not even the five boroughs, but two of the five, you know, you have to let me know. So there are [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2127.12s)]
*  ways to keep an eye on Sean Combs through the federal system again, which is no joke. It's not [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2133.04s)]
*  like it's a walk in the park. It can be if you're a good guy who's never been in trouble and obeys [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2139.44s)]
*  all the rules and it was a money kind of case. Yeah, they can be very lenient on you, but if they [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2145.84s)]
*  want to keep their thumb on you, they have the ability to do so. And those are the, yeah, go [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2150.24s)]
*  ahead, Phil. That's exactly the argument I would be making to the judge. If I were his lawyer, [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2155.6s)]
*  trying to get him released and sentenced to house arrest pending sentencing or, and then [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2160.96s)]
*  arguing for a probation. But look, unless a leopard can change its spots in the last nine or 10 months [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2166.08s)]
*  while he's been in federal lockup, I think that for all the reasons we've been talking about that [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2172.96s)]
*  video and all the testimony of how he has basically kept his thumb on these women and kept them [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2179.44s)]
*  oppressed and subjugated them and used them to demonstrate how he was all-powerful and [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2189.28s)]
*  lording over every aspect of their lives. For those reasons, I think they are still [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2196.2400000000002s)]
*  at risk from him. Even if he's behind bars, they might be at some risk from him, in my opinion. [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2202.2400000000002s)]
*  And so I think that the better and the safer course of action, if you're the judge, is to [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2209.0400000000004s)]
*  leave him in custody and then also to give him the maximum sentence that you can because the judge [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2214.8s)]
*  really should not- Well, can you talk about that, Phil? What do you think it would likely be if the [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2220.0s)]
*  maximum you could get for the transportation to engage in prostitution is up to 10 years in prison [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2224.32s)]
*  and he's been found guilty of two counts but has no criminal history that the court would look at. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2231.44s)]
*  And he does have a criminal history, but it doesn't, as I said at the beginning, [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2236.8s)]
*  arise to a certain level. What would you expect the judge to sentence him to? [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2239.68s)]
*  What would I expect or what would I do? Because if it were me, I would very seriously consider [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2245.44s)]
*  giving him the max and maybe even stacking them for a total- [[00:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2251.44s)]
*  So 20- I would take into consideration all of the things that we've seen in this trial, whether it's [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2254.64s)]
*  something that amounted to a conviction or not, the judge sat there and saw it. And if the judge [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2260.48s)]
*  believed that that's the type of person he is, then the judge would be justified in believing [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2264.8799999999997s)]
*  that he is in more need of rehabilitation than someone who had not done all those things, even [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2269.12s)]
*  if they're barred by the statute of limitations in California. Now, what I expect the judge to do [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2275.92s)]
*  is to kind of maybe split the difference because a lot of times we see that with newbie judges. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2281.2799999999997s)]
*  They want to split the baby King Solomon type and say, look, all right, well, the defense wants him [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2286.4s)]
*  to go home in straight probation. The prosecutor wants the max. I'm going to do something in the [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2290.96s)]
*  middle because I want to be seen as being fair because I'm still making my bones here in the [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2295.12s)]
*  federal judiciary. So I think I would expect the judge to do something probably in the middle. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2300.56s)]
*  What do you think? I don't think that's out of the- and Meg, I can just tell you this. [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2307.3599999999997s)]
*  We're talking about the lawyering and all of that and I'll make it a little personal, right? So [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2311.6s)]
*  the Weinstein case, right? We beat the top charge, but he's still facing basically life [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2316.3199999999997s)]
*  in prison because he's 73 years old with cancer, heart disease, diabetes, but he hasn't been [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2321.36s)]
*  sentenced yet. If he gets sentenced to something where he can see the light at the end of the tunnel [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2325.6800000000003s)]
*  in two years and three years in New York, then you know what? I did my job because I was handed [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2330.08s)]
*  a case that he was sentenced to 23 years, which was the death penalty. And I gave him an opportunity [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2335.28s)]
*  if he could stay healthy in prison, he could get out. Of course, he's got to win the California [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2341.36s)]
*  appeal. The same thing holds true here. Although we all agree this is a huge victory for the defense [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2345.44s)]
*  attorneys. If the judge does what Phil says, it says, I think you're a pretty despicable- you pissed [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2351.44s)]
*  in a woman's mouth until she was gagging. Like, I'm sorry, sir. I can't get that out of my mind. [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2358.0s)]
*  So I'm sentencing you to 10 years on one, 10 years on Cassie, because that's who you pissed in her [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2363.68s)]
*  mouth, and five on the other. And I'm running them consecutively, which means he's got to do like a [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2369.52s)]
*  dozen years. Then even though the lawyers did the best they could, I don't think Sean [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2373.84s)]
*  Coleman is going to look at doing 12 years in prison as a victory. So the book, the last chapter [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2378.48s)]
*  of this book has not been written yet. When, I know you got to run, Arthur, but quickly, [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2384.2400000000002s)]
*  when you get sentenced in federal court, do you have to serve the whole sentence? 85%. I'm pretty [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2388.96s)]
*  sure 85%. There's some stuff that Trump put in the first step back, but it doesn't apply to [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2395.52s)]
*  sex crimes. A lot of the ways to get out of prison early, we represent Delaine Maxwell. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2400.8s)]
*  We're trying to at least get her into a nicer facility. We're not even asking her to be released, [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2406.32s)]
*  just to get her out of a maximum facility. But when you're convicted of a sex crime, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2411.28s)]
*  a lot of the rules go out the window. Okay. Thank you for your analysis. I know you got to run. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2416.6400000000003s)]
*  Thanks for doing this. All the best. Thank you. No problem. Great to have you. Phil, [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2421.44s)]
*  more coming in here. This is from the New York Times. What happened during the verdict as the [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2425.76s)]
*  not guilty verdicts for the sex trafficking counts came on which he was found not guilty, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2430.08s)]
*  members of his family and his legal team began to cry when the full verdict had been read. Mr. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2434.96s)]
*  Combs turned to his family and mouth, I'm going home. And yeah, it may be. And then let me give [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2440.16s)]
*  you another piece. CNN reports that Cassie Ventura's lawyer, Douglas Wigdor, I know him well, [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2446.56s)]
*  um, that he gave the following statement. This case proved that change is long overdue. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2452.56s)]
*  Cassie Ventura paved the way for a jury to find Sean Diddy Combs guilty on some of the counts [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2460.24s)]
*  against him. The entire criminal process, this entire criminal process started when our client, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2464.7999999999997s)]
*  Cassie Ventura had the courage to file her civil complaint in November, 2023. Although the jury [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2469.6s)]
*  did not find Combs guilty of sex trafficking, Cassie, beyond a reasonable doubt, she paved the [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2474.16s)]
*  way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution. He continued by coming [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2478.16s)]
*  forward with her experience. Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2483.12s)]
*  and the fight for justice. Her exemplary courage throughout the trial, um, brought attention to [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2486.88s)]
*  the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2493.2s)]
*  repercussions, repercussion. I've got to say the only part of that that strikes me as real is the [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2497.04s)]
*  last one where yes, if she hadn't come forward, he wouldn't have been exposed. That is true. But [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2501.7599999999998s)]
*  it's, it's a sweet lawyer trying to spin her courage in taking the stand as some sort of a win. [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2508.7999999999997s)]
*  And it just wasn't, it just wasn't a win. They barely believed anything she said, or if they did, [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2515.04s)]
*  they just didn't think it was a legal problem. They didn't think it rose to the level of [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2522.3199999999997s)]
*  criminality. They appear to have bought the defense's argument on Cassie, not the prosecution's [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2526.7999999999997s)]
*  fell. Yeah, it seems that it seems that her words that she has used that expressed, uh, [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2531.44s)]
*  and I'm just generalizing and putting, just putting it all together, her words that, [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2538.64s)]
*  whether it was text messages or other, that indicated that she was something of a willing [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2543.36s)]
*  participant, in fact, eager to participate in some of this. Um, I can see, I don't, this is not my [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2547.68s)]
*  belief, but I can see how a jury might see that might believe that this is a little bit of buyer's [[00:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2554.08s)]
*  remorse by her and that she sees things differently through the lens of hindsight than it really was [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2560.0s)]
*  when all this was going on. And, and we spoke about reasonable doubt. And if you're on the jury and [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2565.76s)]
*  the judge says, if you have a doubt for which a reason can be attached, it is your duty to acquit. [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2571.36s)]
*  Then if the jurors are following those instructions, you know, that means a lot. And [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2578.32s)]
*  if you're in the jury room and you say, look, well, I think he's a bad guy and he probably did, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2582.4s)]
*  you know, pressure her, but she, she made these statements that, and she expressed some willingness [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2586.88s)]
*  to be there. So according to the judge, uh, this is a doubt in my brain and I've got a duty to [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2592.32s)]
*  acquit on that charge. And I think that's really probably the best way to explain it. And it's also [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2598.1600000000003s)]
*  true by the way, that had she not been willing to come forward and testify, we will, we wouldn't [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2603.44s)]
*  have had this trial and we wouldn't have the convictions that we do have back to what you [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2607.76s)]
*  were saying. I don't know who you said reported this, but somebody was reporting that he's waving [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2613.2s)]
*  his fist saying I'm coming home. That might be a little bit premature. And I don't know if his [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2617.52s)]
*  lawyers have maybe told him that, okay, if you, if it's just these counts, that's a time served thing. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2623.2s)]
*  If that, if that's the case, he might be prematurely celebrating, uh, his release. I'm not so sure that's [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2630.0s)]
*  going to happen. Right. Cause we're going to find out. We think today around 1 p.m. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2636.64s)]
*  what the judge is going to do, at least in between now and the sentencing, like how long does it [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2642.48s)]
*  normally take between the guilty verdict and the sentencing? Is there any chance that we have to [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2647.5200000000004s)]
*  do all the reports and all that? There's no way where he's getting sentenced today at one. It's [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2652.4s)]
*  just about whether he stays in jail pending sentencing. No, in the state system, a lot of [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2655.5200000000004s)]
*  times you can move straight into sentencing, but not, I don't expect that in this case. There will [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2660.4s)]
*  be a pre-sentence investigation. Um, and it's entirely in the judge's discretion, but I'd say [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2664.6400000000003s)]
*  in roughly a month, uh, give or take they'll be back, maybe two, um, they'll be back for the [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2670.32s)]
*  sentencing after which time the judge can take advantage of the, um, reports that have been [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2675.6800000000003s)]
*  generated by the probation department, uh, looking in at not only the things that happened in the [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2681.04s)]
*  trial, but other things related to his background. They really do a deep dive and present all of it [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2686.6400000000003s)]
*  to the judge. And they actually might make a recommendation as well. It's not binding on the [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2692.2400000000002s)]
*  court. Um, and you better believe that during the intervening time, the, both the prosecutor [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2696.88s)]
*  and the defense, they're going to be asked to submit something called a, um, sentencing [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2704.0s)]
*  memorandum, which is where you, uh, lay out your case to the judge in writing as to what [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2709.84s)]
*  sentence you're seeking and why, and why it factors into the guidelines and is supported by law. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2716.08s)]
*  And those things, um, I would imagine each side may have already gotten a head start, at least [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2722.64s)]
*  drafting it or at least laying out the structure of it. But, you know, that could be several pages [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2728.24s)]
*  long. Those documents can be, um, you know, four or five or six pages or could be, you know, a [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2733.04s)]
*  little bit longer depending on the circumstances, but those have to be prepared, submitted, reviewed. [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2738.4s)]
*  So all those things are going to take several weeks to, to, to make it happen. Um, as, and as [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2743.12s)]
*  we've been talking about, it's going to take a while. So I got to say this, um, today at one [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2749.28s)]
*  is going to be an epic moment in legal news across the United States of America, because we may find [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2754.4s)]
*  out, yes, this is interesting whether he stays in jail pending the sentencing, uh, by this judge. [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2760.2400000000002s)]
*  And we are also going to hear Brian Kohlberger, we believe say he is guilty of quadruple murder [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2766.0s)]
*  in Idaho, which will be on camera and we will be showing it to the audience in full. So in our last [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2772.6400000000003s)]
*  minute together, Phil, um, your thoughts on the Kohlberger plea. So I am in the camp that the [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2779.12s)]
*  Kohlberger plea deal, uh, is preposterous. I think that unless you've got all of the families on board [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2785.52s)]
*  with it and that you've, uh, you've counseled with the families and you've got all of their support [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2792.08s)]
*  and you've got a rock solid case, the evidence against him is overwhelming. Uh, I think the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2797.92s)]
*  only reason to take the death penalty off the table and to take a plea deal is if the families [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2803.52s)]
*  were lobbying for it. I understand that the families here were split, some wanted it, some [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2810.24s)]
*  didn't. And, you know, I understand the reasons for, for why they might or might not want the plea [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2814.8s)]
*  deal. But if you've got a rock solid case and you don't have all of the families on board with it, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2819.68s)]
*  I think the prosecutor should have gone forward with the trial and sought the death penalty. [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2825.6s)]
*  So agree with every word you just said. Phil, thank you. Thanks so much for doing this. Um, [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2830.48s)]
*  Arthur, goodbye. And thanks to him as well. Uh, we want our audience to stay tuned because now [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2836.3999999999996s)]
*  we're going to turn to the Brian Kohlberger plea hearing. It's going to start at one and we are [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2841.44s)]
*  going to cover it in full. Okay. To hear him say he committed these murders. We'll have that live [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2846.7999999999997s)]
*  on YouTube and on SiriusXM with instant reaction. See you then. [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=33BSftmwY1Y&t=2852.8799999999997s)]
