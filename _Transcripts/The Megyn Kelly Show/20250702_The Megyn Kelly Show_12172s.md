Video Description: Megyn Kelly gives her instant analysis reaction to the monumental news that Diddy has been found not guilty on the most serious charges he was up against, the two guilty verdicts he did receive, and more. Then she's joined by legal experts Arthur Aidala and Phil Holloway to talk about why the not guilty verdict in most of the counts is a huge win for Diddy, the way the defendant celebrated the ruling, why this might have been predicted given the way the trial developed, Diddy's outrageous actions in the courtroom after the verdict was read, whether the jury got it wrong, and more. Then we turn to the live Bryan Kohberger plea hearing with Howard Blum, author of "When the Night Comes Falling," and legal expert Matt Murphy join to discuss the depravity of the Idaho murders as Kohberger takes a plea deal, the disconnect between the prosecution and the victim’s families, whether this feels like justice for the victims, the most extraordinary moments during the plea hearing, the prosecution’s failure to pursue the death penalty after insisting they had the evidence for it, questions around the ethics of the decision to allow the plea to happen, the anger at least one Idaho victim family feels at the prosecution, the prosecutor's performative tearing up while talking, the judge mispronouncing the name of one of the victims, speculation that Kohberger wanted the plea deal to save his parents from testifying, whether Kohberger might be able to get out of jail eventually, and more.

*  Sean combs has been found not guilty on the majority of counts against him and has been found guilty of [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=145.04s)]
*  only the two [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=153.0s)]
*  Least serious crimes that he was charged with there is little question that this is a defeat for the prosecution [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=154.48s)]
*  The two counts on which he's been found guilty are transportation to engage in prostitution [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=162.28s)]
*  With respect there were two counts of it with respect to Cassie Ventura and Jane [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=168.23999999999998s)]
*  Who testified under a pseudonym and he has been found not guilty on racketeering? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=173.28s)]
*  Not guilty on sex trafficking with respect to Cassie Ventura and with respect to Jane [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=178.0s)]
*  Both of those sex trafficking counts required at 15 years minimum in prison [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=184.32s)]
*  The Rico count that he's been found not guilty of was a sentence of 20 to life though [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=190.98s)]
*  It didn't have a mandatory minimum. So the sex trafficking ones were extremely serious 15 years minimum and [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=196.39999999999998s)]
*  He's escaped liability on both of those. He's escaped criminal [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=202.22s)]
*  guilt on both of those [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=206.62s)]
*  It was a it was going to be a miracle [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=209.1s)]
*  It was going to be an obvious jury nullification if he escaped a guilty verdict on [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=212.14s)]
*  Transportation to engage in prostitution the evidence was overwhelming that he did that there were receipts [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=217.78s)]
*  There was testimony by the escorts [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=223.62s)]
*  it was very clear that Sean Combs did pay these male escorts to cross state lines and to come into his various hotel rooms and [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=225.5s)]
*  have sex with his girlfriends Cassie and Jane and [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=233.57999999999998s)]
*  They had him dead to rights on that [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=238.66s)]
*  I mean he really should have pled guilty on those and I've been saying all along if they found him not guilty on those [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  It would prove that this has been a total nullification of the jury [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=245.34s)]
*  He was a famous man and they didn't want to find him guilty because it's very clear. He did those two [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=249.38s)]
*  It is stunning that he managed to escape a guilty verdict on Rico less stunning on Rico [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=254.18s)]
*  but on sex trafficking where the evidence was just [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=261.06s)]
*  overwhelming on [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=264.42s)]
*  the fact that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=265.62s)]
*  He did threaten at least Cassie and Jane over and over again [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=267.14s)]
*  He beat both women when they would not comply with his demands [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=272.34s)]
*  but clearly what we're seeing here is the jury bought and [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=277.65999999999997s)]
*  believed the defense argument [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=281.78s)]
*  That these women had agency that these women were not forced to do anything [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=284.42s)]
*  The defense got up there and argued that they were swingers that they were engaging in a swinger [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=289.58s)]
*  Lifestyle notwithstanding the beatings it took to get them to comply in certain instances [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=297.3s)]
*  The jury clearly bought that [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=304.65999999999997s)]
*  There was testimony that would be helpful for the defense [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=307.7s)]
*  I don't mean to scoff at the conclusion entirely there was testimony to support a not guilty [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=310.26s)]
*  including text messages from Cassie Ventura saying I can't wait to freak off I love our freak offs when we both want them and [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=315.98s)]
*  Testimony that Cassie stayed in part because she loved the lifestyle [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=323.78000000000003s)]
*  she loved the trappings of life with Diddy and [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=328.34s)]
*  Jane is still having her apartment paid for by Sean Combs to this moment and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=332.14s)]
*  There definitely could be a takeaway that Jane was in it because she wanted the apartment and she wanted to be connected with somebody famous [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=338.98s)]
*  Rich and not because she had any fear for her life or otherwise or retribution if she submitted [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=347.38s)]
*  New York Times reporting here color from inside the courtroom Sean Combs is smiling [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=355.5s)]
*  As he shook one of his lawyers hands and turned again to look at his family [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=360.46s)]
*  He put his hands together in prayer and mouth. Thank you. Thank you at the jury. That's the right thing to say Sean Combs [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=364.14s)]
*  He pumped his right fist [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=369.82s)]
*  Yep, this is exactly the right [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=372.18s)]
*  Attitude for Sean Combs who just got away with serious felonies in my view [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=374.78000000000003s)]
*  He's guilty as sin in my view and this jury just gave him a total pass. They bought Mark Agnifilo's [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=379.7s)]
*  Argument it appears the same one that did not work for Agnifilo in the NXIVM [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=388.08s)]
*  Sex cult case out of Albany, New York in which he went in there and said these women we don't do sex cults [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=392.66s)]
*  Women are powerful women make their own decisions these women up in this other case chose to have themselves branded [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=399.16s)]
*  No one made them with his guys initials and he tried the same thing here, but with a much much better result [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=405.72s)]
*  This this is a win for Sean did he comes there's no question about it the [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=411.28000000000003s)]
*  minimum charge or the charges likely on [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=417.0s)]
*  This particular count are far less serious. It's a it calls for up to ten years in prison [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=421.56s)]
*  There's no way he's going to get ten years in prison on these two unless you have a judge. He's very very angry for some reason [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=427.96s)]
*  we looked at the [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=434.64s)]
*  The federal sentencing guidelines which are just recommendations the judge doesn't have to follow them [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=437.03999999999996s)]
*  He can go any place between zero and ten [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=442.12s)]
*  But we we deduced that he has an offense level of about 26 points [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=444.44s)]
*  Which calls for a sentence of five point two five years to six point five years in prison the base [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=449.76s)]
*  Offense level for this crime we deduced to be about 14 [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=457.2s)]
*  This is all on a sliding scale plus you add another four levels because the offense may have involved coercion anyway [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=460.47999999999996s)]
*  And then there another four for causing another person to engage in a sexual act [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=466.06s)]
*  So if they believe that if this judge says that's what happened [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=470.28s)]
*  He could be facing five or six years in prison on each count. They would be likely to run consecutive [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=473.59999999999997s)]
*  Although it's possible the judge could say they run [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=479.76s)]
*  One after the other [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=482.36s)]
*  Or together congruent, so we'll see [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=484.36s)]
*  Likely to run at the same time is my view. There's no way he's getting more than five years in prison [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=486.36s)]
*  But that won't the sentencing won't happen today [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=491.36s)]
*  That'll happen. I believe it another at another hearing. I want to bring in Phil Holloway. He's been watching this case [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=493.36s)]
*  You know him from our coverage of the Fannie Willis matter [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=500.36s)]
*  He's a trial attorney down in Atlanta, Georgia and Phil you had been [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=503.36s)]
*  Feeling and predicting that we were headed for a likely NG [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=508.36s)]
*  I realize it's not a full not guilty, but anybody who tells you this isn't a win for Diddy is lying to you [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=512.04s)]
*  This is an absolute win for him, and that's why he's pumping his fist and smiling today your thoughts [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=518.04s)]
*  Well, thanks for having me. It's always great to be with you here Megan look [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=523.84s)]
*  This is about many things, but at the heart of this verdict. I think is [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=528.84s)]
*  Reasonable doubt I mean all it takes for a jury to find someone not guilty is one doubt for which a reason can be attached [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=534.32s)]
*  And if you have statements made by victims you you've read some of them in your opening just now where these alleged victims [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=541.32s)]
*  Had expressed a willingness and a desire to participate in some of these things it is absolutely [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=548.32s)]
*  Inescapable and it's a very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=553.32s)]
*  Difficult to find someone not guilty of a crime and a desire to participate in some of these things it is a very difficult thing for a prosecutor [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=560.8000000000001s)]
*  Sometimes to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that despite those statements and despite that evidence they are in fact [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=567.8000000000001s)]
*  Victims okay, and so the jury is probably going to leave there thinking you know what he's a slimy person [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=574.8000000000001s)]
*  He's a terrible person. He's probably guilty of all of these things [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=580.8000000000001s)]
*  But the prosecution was just unable to prove to us beyond a reasonable doubt all the elements of the crimes as to the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=585.28s)]
*  The rest of the counts and look whatever the judge does give him in terms of sentencing [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=592.28s)]
*  There's no parole speak of in the federal system [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=597.28s)]
*  And it's entirely possible that these are not run consecutively or concurrently they could in fact be stacked potentially [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=600.28s)]
*  And there's no reason to think that the judge is going to stay necessarily within the sentencing guidelines [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=608.76s)]
*  It's very possible that the judge maxes out whatever is possible on what he's been convicted of [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=615.76s)]
*  So for a man of his age, you know, even a five or six or seven year prison sentence in the federal system is not insignificant at all [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=621.76s)]
*  Now I do agree with you on balance. This was a win. He's already been in custody for [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=631.24s)]
*  You know ten months or so. I think it is now and he will get credit for that. So [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=637.24s)]
*  For Diddy and for his team, there is a something of a light at the end of his tunnel [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=642.24s)]
*  But it's not over yet. The sentencing could still be relatively severe under the circumstances [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=647.24s)]
*  The my team's informing me if there are no enhancements, no enhancements to the sent to the bare minimum [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=654.72s)]
*  Sentencing under the transportation to engage in prostitution charges [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=660.72s)]
*  One conviction of on this charge would be 15 to 21 months [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=664.72s)]
*  Two counts convicted under two counts, which is what he has been is 21 to 27 months [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=669.72s)]
*  So about two years, but we believe that there will be enhancements given the level that he was accused of coercion and so on [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=676.72s)]
*  So we'll see so we're looking at probably two [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=684.2s)]
*  I mean it technically could be up to ten years, but it's not gonna be that because he has a criminal record [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=686.52s)]
*  But he did not it's not so great that he served jail for more than 30 [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=691.28s)]
*  Days or got to the point where this would be held against him [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=695.88s)]
*  They in other words [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=698.84s)]
*  They don't count his criminal history against him unless he was sentenced to more than a year of probation or 30 days in jail [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=699.72s)]
*  On prior offenses and he wasn't so it's as if he had no prior offenses New York Times reporting that Mark Agnifilo [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=704.84s)]
*  Sean combs his lead lawyer has asked that his client be released ahead of sentencing now that [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=712.6s)]
*  He is no longer facing sex trafficking and racketeering conspiracy charges much more serious charges than the ones that he was convicted on [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=717.6s)]
*  He's saying combs is not a flight risk because he does not have access to his passport or his plane [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=724.64s)]
*  This is his first conviction [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=730.36s)]
*  He says and it's a prostitution offense and so he should be released on appropriate conditions [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=731.88s)]
*  Agnifilo said the lawyers asking that mr. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=735.88s)]
*  Combs returned to his home in Miami Beach, Florida. That's very interesting and he's probably going to win that I think we'll see [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=738.04s)]
*  Bringing in now Arthur Idallah famed criminal defense attorney, but also has a history as a prosecutor back when he was younger [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=745.2s)]
*  just got off of the Harvey Weinstein trial himself and [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=752.04s)]
*  Your reaction Arthur to the breaking news that Sean combs basically won this case but for two prostitution counts [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=755.28s)]
*  It's a tremendous. It's a tremendous victory. And here's why I'm personally happy the [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=762.28s)]
*  Prosecutor who brought the case Damian Williams. I don't think he was a good guy [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=767.5999999999999s)]
*  I don't think he was a good US attorney in the Southern District. I think his personal ambitions just clouded his judgment [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=773.36s)]
*  I mean he was going around telling people quietly that he was positioning himself to run for president of the United States and [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=780.4399999999999s)]
*  He wanted to bring down combs. He wanted to bring on the mayor of the city of New York [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=787.88s)]
*  That was his ambition and the conviction rates are so high in the Southern District that once you get indicted [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=791.6800000000001s)]
*  It's it's over 90% when you go to trial so [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=799.6s)]
*  This is a huge victory for [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=804.84s)]
*  For the for the defense for Sean because there's no mandatory minimum [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=808.08s)]
*  You know you when I spoke yesterday all these other counts the judge if it was his uncle has to send him to prison [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=811.9200000000001s)]
*  But that's not the case here [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=817.48s)]
*  however [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=819.6800000000001s)]
*  Don't think this judge is gonna give him a walk in the park either [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=821.12s)]
*  He's definitely giving him jail time the judge is allowed to take into consideration [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=824.76s)]
*  All of the factors he heard during this trial even the ones he was acquitted of [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=829.04s)]
*  I was involved in the case where it was a murder case in federal court [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=834.12s)]
*  The guy was acquitted of the murder but there was a drug aspect of it that he was convicted of [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=838.12s)]
*  He should have gotten three or four years and the judge gave him the maximum [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=843.56s)]
*  With all the enhancements and she's put on the record I'm taking into account all the facts [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=847.04s)]
*  I heard about the murder so Sean Combs could be home in a very short amount of time or you can you know [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=852.56s)]
*  I think it's up to ten years that he can be he can be sentenced to so if you're the defense attorney though Megan [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=858.48s)]
*  You're you're you're very [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=865.4399999999999s)]
*  Satisfied with the outcome of this case. You're thrilled [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=868.3199999999999s)]
*  You can't say thrilled because your client did get found guilty on two counts, but you're thrilled [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=872.8s)]
*  This guy was looking at life in prison life in prison if he got convicted on the Rico count and those sex trafficking [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=879.68s)]
*  Counts two of them one for Cassie one for Jane are no joke [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=886.3199999999999s)]
*  15 years minimum required [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=890.8399999999999s)]
*  Right the judge has no discretion so [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=894.92s)]
*  You know that he managed to skate on both of those this coming in now [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=898.0s)]
*  That the defense again trying to argue for his freedom pending sentencing. They suggested a one million dollar bond [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=902.08s)]
*  The judge had rejected that pending trial they asked repeatedly to get Sean Combs out on bail pending trial the judge repeatedly said no [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=909.5600000000001s)]
*  The government here vehemently opposing Sean Combs is released the lead prosecutor Maureen Comey saying the defense is underplaying the seriousness of the conviction [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=917.24s)]
*  And is urging the judge to keep him detained [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=925.72s)]
*  What kind of factors would go into that analysis guys do you know like what when the judge you got a conviction? [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=929.24s)]
*  But it's two prostitution counts. I mean they are felony counts, but I don't know would you normally detain a guy like this? [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=935.28s)]
*  Megan all I can say is this if they put it forth the same bail package that they have put forth [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=942.76s)]
*  Where he was gonna have to stay in his house pay for his own security [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=948.4399999999999s)]
*  Obviously have ankle bondage one have no electronic devices in his house except like a landline [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=952.72s)]
*  Old-school telephone to communicate with people it would be so beyond the pale [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=958.4399999999999s)]
*  It would be such an injustice for this judge not to give him bail under those conditions [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=963.8s)]
*  based on this conviction if [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=970.4399999999999s)]
*  Sean Combs or anyone went in and pled guilty to this count you would be looking at a probably a non-jail [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=973.4s)]
*  Disposition you probably be looking at [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=980.96s)]
*  some form of probation [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=983.56s)]
*  I don't think he's gonna get probation because of the jail the note of writing who he is, but he absolutely [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=985.64s)]
*  He's not a danger to society under those bail conditions. He's not a flight risk under those bail conditions [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=991.1199999999999s)]
*  He's no longer facing mandatory [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=997.3599999999999s)]
*  Jail time so the judge definitely definitely should be giving him some sort of bail package [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1000.28s)]
*  Right now the New York Times reporting the judge said he needs time to consider the law [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1006.8399999999999s)]
*  Before making a decision on whether combs can walk out of the courthouse today [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1011.6s)]
*  He's been incarcerated since September of 2024 [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1015.92s)]
*  I mean how much time like can the judge take here just he sends him back to prison. It's like [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1019.12s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know how much time is he gonna take [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1024.96s)]
*  If I can feel that when I have a little bit different take on it Megan look [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1027.64s)]
*  He's he no longer has the presumption of innocence right at least with respect to the charges [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1031.84s)]
*  Convicted of so there's no right to bail like there might be arguably a right to bail in in a pre-trial [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1037.3999999999999s)]
*  Situation at least if you meet the criteria in this case the judge already knows whether or not [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1045.44s)]
*  He's thinking about sending combs to prison for some extended period of time [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1051.52s)]
*  And if he's going to send him to prison, there's no real [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1056.6s)]
*  It doesn't only make sense to go ahead and release him now if he's going to be giving him some additional [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1061.68s)]
*  Jail time why let him out go ahead and let him begin serving that now [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1066.72s)]
*  He's he's he's already convicted the judge has heard all of the evidence of all of the [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1072.1200000000001s)]
*  terrible things that [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1079.08s)]
*  combs has done during his life and particularly with respect to some of these women the [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1080.84s)]
*  Domestic violence the drugs all of it. He's heard all of this stuff [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1086.72s)]
*  And so if he is thinking like look look found the judge and if I'm thinking okay [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1090.44s)]
*  I'm gonna be sending him. Let's just say it's gonna be a three or four year prison sentence [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1094.76s)]
*  I'm gonna say no, you're not gonna get out on bail. You're gonna go ahead and stay in custody [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1098.52s)]
*  We'll sentence you next month, but that way this time is counting towards the overall sentence [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1102.56s)]
*  Yeah, on the other hand if the judge is thinking okay, I'm gonna let him out on probation [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1108.78s)]
*  Well, and he and if he lets him out on bond and that could be an indicator that the judge is thinking about [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1112.6s)]
*  Probation or some lower jail term. I don't think the judge is thinking about a bare minimum jail term [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1118.16s)]
*  Maybe not the maximum probably something in the middle and in my view that would weigh in favor of keeping him in custody [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1123.3999999999999s)]
*  Denying the bail package it doesn't do much good to let somebody go home to Miami Beach [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1131.7199999999998s)]
*  Just to order them back to prison a few months later at least in my view [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1136.32s)]
*  No, no, that's a great thing that actually is a great point [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1140.3s)]
*  And I will tell you from what my clients tell me the hardest part about going to prison is going to prison is [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1142.84s)]
*  Actually those first days and right now believe it or not Sean Combs has a routine it may have been thrown off for the trial [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1149.12s)]
*  But you know, he knows all the people he knows the guards. He knows the commissary. He knows the work. So he's in a [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1155.84s)]
*  Relatively comfort zone as opposed to him leaving and then going back which makes things more difficult [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1161.6s)]
*  However, these charges in the world of federal criminal law are pretty minute [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1167.76s)]
*  Mm-hmm there. I mean it is a felony. It's not the same as like [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1174.28s)]
*  Hiring a prostitute and like getting caught in hotel room with her right transportation to engage in prostitution as a federal crime is [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1178.3s)]
*  A felony with real jail time attached to it. So this is not that petty Annie [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1185.94s)]
*  It's not as small as it could be but yeah compared to the other charges he was facing [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1190.8799999999999s)]
*  Here's one other bit of color for you New York Times report reporting [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1195.06s)]
*  This won't surprise you combs his body language is totally different from yesterday when he seemed [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1198.74s)]
*  Crestfallen and grim after the jury said it had reached a verdict on four of the five counts now [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1203.98s)]
*  acquitted of the most serious charges. Mr. Combs appears energetic and relieved [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1209.9s)]
*  Can we just talk about here's the picture? Here's a sketch artists picture of combs yesterday of the grimness and [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1214.54s)]
*  I'm sure we'll get one today of him looking much more relieved. I [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1221.98s)]
*  I'm so confused about [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1225.74s)]
*  Here's a little bit more New York Times with a touch of levity [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1228.58s)]
*  The judge said he assumed combs would not want to return to the Brooklyn jail [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1231.38s)]
*  Where he had he has been held combs shook his head vigorously and put his hands together in prayer [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1235.1s)]
*  Oh, it's all just so chummy inside the courtroom for this disgusting pervert female abuser [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1240.86s)]
*  Who I can't believe is about to roam our streets again. I'm sorry. I'm disgusted by this verdict. This is fucking ridiculous [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1247.74s)]
*  I just find it absolutely outrageous the amount of crime that this guy just got away with I believe he committed arson [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1255.1s)]
*  He definitely battered Cassie. He battered Jane to the statute of limitations for battery in Los Angeles [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1260.86s)]
*  California is one year one year [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1267.6599999999999s)]
*  So if they didn't charge him for battery within one year and they couldn't because he bought the tape and it remained hidden [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1270.58s)]
*  Thanks to those security guards out there [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1276.62s)]
*  Then they could never charge him with that again. There's no question [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1279.22s)]
*  He dragged her back into that hotel room. Why wasn't that kidnapping? They only talked about the kidnapping of [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1282.94s)]
*  Capricorn Clark who was his his sort of main assistant because she said he grabbed her and made her go with him over to [[00:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1289.5s)]
*  Kid Cuddy's house [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1297.3s)]
*  There's no question he broke into Kid Cuddy's house in my view and that he opened up the Christmas presents and locked the door in [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1298.02s)]
*  And made a threat. There's no question in my mind [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1303.94s)]
*  He was behind the arson of Kid Cuddy's car and there was proof plenty of proof to prove that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1306.1399999999999s)]
*  No, okay [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1311.78s)]
*  There was female fingerprints they found on that [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1312.66s)]
*  The fire bomb that was left there the Molotov cocktail and the prosecution said there's no question [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1314.98s)]
*  He didn't do it himself, but he said I'm going to bomb Kid Cuddy's car [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1319.46s)]
*  It's in writing Cassie Ventura emailed her mother saying oh my god [[00:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1324.38s)]
*  He's threatening to bomb his car and two weeks later it got bombed. Oh gee. It was just some third party [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1328.02s)]
*  You also had it's just like the proof was there the beatings the threats that if they didn't go back into those rooms and get [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1333.42s)]
*  Off with these male escorts that they were gonna get beaten the testimony from that Daniel Philip who was the male escort who heard [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1340.06s)]
*  Combs abusing Cassie behind the door and she was screaming. I'm sorry [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1346.7s)]
*  I'm sorry as he heard him slapping her get back out there. She came back out. She was shaking [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1352.06s)]
*  She got back into the escorts lap [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1356.6599999999999s)]
*  Physically shaking she was so scared to the point where that guy couldn't perform sexually because this was so horrifying to him [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1358.7s)]
*  What what in the actual F went on in there? [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1365.78s)]
*  Don't make it let me wait. Let me just for one second Phil. I just let me just get Megan more pissed off if I may [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1370.1s)]
*  so if the judge gives him a [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1377.22s)]
*  Reasonable sentence, let's say since the five years, okay, and he's already get time in Atlanta with a halfway house [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1380.06s)]
*  He's out in three how quick is he going to be accepted back into that Hollywood? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1385.6599999999999s)]
*  Scene blah blah blah blah, or do you think people will still keep him out of arms late? I [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1391.7s)]
*  Mean look I will make it my personal mission to maintain [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1396.74s)]
*  In the minds of all Americans, there's no question [[00:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1402.66s)]
*  He he's fallen as this revered figure for a large portion of America [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1406.1s)]
*  But he also has die-hard fans who want to pretend this is a Johnny Depp situation [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1412.22s)]
*  You know where where he was wrongfully accused [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1416.76s)]
*  That's that's my own view by somebody who was out to get him who played the victim when in fact she was abusive [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1419.42s)]
*  This is not that situation. This is not Cassandra Ventura was an extremely sympathetic witness who was not some powerful [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1424.76s)]
*  I'm gonna play a kid Cuddy against Sean Combs. She was traumatized by this guy [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1432.28s)]
*  She remains suicidal to this day given all that was done to her. Listen at this [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1437.56s)]
*  I'm like I almost don't even want to read these updates [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1443.12s)]
*  New York Times Sean Combs is now on his knees his elbows on the chair where he was sitting his head buried [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1445.84s)]
*  He appeared to be [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1453.22s)]
*  Praying he started he started a round of applause which was echoed by his family who are jubilant [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1454.9s)]
*  Yay, yay, we only have an abuser and [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1462.26s)]
*  Solicitor of prostitutes in the family not a sex trafficker [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1466.38s)]
*  Sean Combs his supporters and family are now clapping and whistling for his legal team who are all embracing each other [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1469.5800000000002s)]
*  They actually did get a victory and that's different time. They should be should be hugging. Go ahead Phil [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1476.0200000000002s)]
*  Judge is allowing that kind of thing in the court. I'm surprised about that also [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1481.3s)]
*  Or maybe the judges all back there's no place in the courtroom for this because look [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1486.74s)]
*  Regardless of whether or not you agree or disagree with the verdict [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1492.38s)]
*  There's a certain dignity and decorum. That's only a print that's appropriate for courtrooms and in federal courts judges are [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1495.86s)]
*  Famous for enforcing it oftentimes much more so than at the state level [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1503.94s)]
*  But look back to your whole thing. This is a Biden appointee. So who knows about the dignity required? Sorry. Keep going [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1508.08s)]
*  Back to your dismay with the jury's verdict. Look juries are always wild card [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1515.24s)]
*  You got 12 people in there that come from different backgrounds different walks of life. They have different political philosophies [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1520.4399999999998s)]
*  They have different religious philosophies. They have their own biases whether they say they can leave them outside the courtroom or not [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1526.6999999999998s)]
*  They bring them in there and they analyze and they view things and sometimes jurors are just stupid [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1532.96s)]
*  Sometimes they're just dumb. Sometimes they're not capable of understanding the law or following the judge's instructions [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1538.6000000000001s)]
*  So you factor all of that in there and what you've got is a system where guess what? [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1544.5600000000002s)]
*  After doing this almost 40 years. I have come to the conclusion that you cannot trust [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1549.8000000000002s)]
*  Jurors to ever get it right whether you're a prosecutor or whether you're a defense lawyer [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1555.6000000000001s)]
*  Jurors and juries cannot be trusted to get it right they get it wrong a lot and that is what [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1560.3999999999999s)]
*  Usually brings people to the bargaining table to come up with, you know plea deals like we have seen maybe in the Koberger case [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1568.04s)]
*  Coming up today, but look you just can't trust a jury ever to get to the right result [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1574.48s)]
*  Sometimes they do but a lot of times unfortunately they don't and that cuts both ways for the prosecution and the defense [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1581.48s)]
*  I'm so confused on what the jury has done here like when you factor in the notes we got yesterday Arthur [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1588.0s)]
*  We get a note saying they reached a verdict on counts two through five [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1594.6399999999999s)]
*  But they couldn't agree on count one, which was the racketeering conspiracy now [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1599.36s)]
*  We find out that at that time we assume it didn't change [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1603.28s)]
*  They thought he was guilty of the prostitution stuff [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1606.0s)]
*  but they did not think that he was a sex trafficker who forced Cassie and Jane to [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1608.44s)]
*  perform sex acts under threat of coercion or fraud [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1613.56s)]
*  and [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1617.3600000000001s)]
*  Yet they were they were about to be a hung jury on the Rico count now [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1618.44s)]
*  I don't get it and then today I guess the people holdouts who said I think he's guilty of Rico this morning turned around [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1623.48s)]
*  And said alright, he's not he's not because they acquitted him of that. I don't get it because to prove [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1629.0s)]
*  To how was there a juror who said he didn't sex traffic, but he might be guilty of Rico [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1634.1200000000001s)]
*  I guess there somebody was looking at the Rico statute saying maybe he did do the arson [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1641.4s)]
*  Maybe he did do the drug selling [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1645.8s)]
*  Right the other predicate right there were other predicate acts that they didn't have to be the ones he was charged with they were [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1648.16s)]
*  ones outside of the charge crimes that they could have [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1654.6s)]
*  Said those were predicate acts and therefore he's guilty of the racketeering but I'm happy he didn't you know [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1658.6s)]
*  Look, I got no I'm with you about who Sean combs is as a person [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1665.96s)]
*  But as someone who works in the system this Rico law has really been abused as of late and [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1670.1999999999998s)]
*  Because from what it is an original intent was to what they're using it for now [[00:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1676.9199999999998s)]
*  So I'm happy that this didn't play out or maybe they were confused on well [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1681.6399999999999s)]
*  Even if he did do some of the other predicate acts is his business [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1688.3999999999999s)]
*  This which is music and recording and taking care of other artists and clothing and alcohol and all of this stuff [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1692.8799999999999s)]
*  Is that really a criminal enterprise or is it a legitimate enterprise that mr. Combs? [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1699.36s)]
*  individually did some criminality with [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1704.72s)]
*  So it probably got a little confusing a little mixed up. I'm happy [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1708.24s)]
*  Maybe this will have a chilling effect on prosecutors across the country to just be throwing these Rico counts around [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1712.08s)]
*  Where they not they are not really deserved but it also goes to you'd never know what happens [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1718.96s)]
*  When a [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1725.52s)]
*  Jury goes out overnight and they go home and they go to sleep and they think about it and let's face it [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1726.8s)]
*  The Sean combs stuff is popping up all over everyone's phone in the back of the cab [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1731.6s)]
*  So who knows what they heard who knows what they absorbed and what changed but something changed really quickly, right? [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1736.12s)]
*  It's not like they were in there and it's three o'clock this afternoon [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1742.68s)]
*  I mean they came in they must take one hour and it was over [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1745.2s)]
*  No, and they were not sequestered [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1748.48s)]
*  So they had access to their friends and family and who knows how that went and whose input if any they took [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1750.56s)]
*  During that time frame want to say this this just happened inside the courtroom [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1756.6s)]
*  The court the Times reporting the court is adjourning for a few hours while the judge considers the arguments from mr [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1761.52s)]
*  Combs his lawyers and prosecutors about whether he should be released [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1768.12s)]
*  inner-city press which is an organization that's been reporting on this from the beginning says yes [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1771.76s)]
*  Okay that that proposal wait a couple hours. Give me a couple hours. That makes sense. Mr [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1776.46s)]
*  Combs does not want to go back to the detention center. He is shaking his head [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1780.64s)]
*  So something about at 1 p.m. Will convene and I'll let the parties know [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1785.46s)]
*  So I'm not sure exactly whether he gives the decision at one or they're just gonna reconvene it once Megan [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1790.74s)]
*  What's happening right now is a very young inexperienced judge is now going in the Southern District of New York where there are literally judges [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1796.18s)]
*  Appointed I think rolling back to George HW Bush [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1804.22s)]
*  There's definitely a bunch of Clinton employees meaning people have been on the bench for 35 40 years [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1807.78s)]
*  And he is gonna have his one or two mentors and he's going to their chambers or picking their brain somehow or another [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1812.62s)]
*  And say what do you think I should do? [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1819.0s)]
*  Not to embarrass myself because it always comes down to covering your own butt with these judges in my opinion [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1821.14s)]
*  And then that that's how he's gonna make it. He's not looking up any case law. There's no case law on this [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1827.26s)]
*  It's his discretion. You know what the case law is. It's totally in his discretion [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1832.44s)]
*  So he's gonna go and ask judge Lewis Kaplan who was the one who tried the Trump case [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1836.8600000000001s)]
*  He's gonna go look at all, you know, all these these famous the guy who just did the Menendez case [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1841.88s)]
*  Judge Stein he was those are both in Clinton appointees. They've been around for decades and you know, see, what do you think? [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1847.1200000000001s)]
*  What do you think? What do you think? And then he'll do what whatever he thinks is in his best interest [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1853.44s)]
*  So what do you think before I toss? Yeah, go ahead Phil. Yeah you go [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1858.1200000000001s)]
*  What and he sees exactly correct that's what the judge is doing [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1861.8s)]
*  He's just going back and asking another judge [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1865.08s)]
*  What am I supposed to do under these circumstances and I bet the advice that he gets is something along the lines of look [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1867.2399999999998s)]
*  Do you think you're gonna send him to prison for any length of time if the answer is yes [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1872.8s)]
*  Maybe consider keeping him in jail [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1877.76s)]
*  If you're not sure that you're gonna send him to prison [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1880.08s)]
*  Maybe let him go on house arrest until you figure that out [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1883.6s)]
*  Or maybe you already know that you're not gonna send him to any significant prison in in which case [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1886.54s)]
*  You know that would make sense to go ahead and let him out [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1891.1399999999999s)]
*  But I think the best advice that any other judge could give this newbie judge would be that look [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1893.78s)]
*  keep him in jail if you think you're going to send him back to prison because [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1900.26s)]
*  Once you let him out you're gonna start getting all kinds of motions to delay [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1905.54s)]
*  report dates to do to to delay this to delay that and it's just gonna open up a big can of worms that [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1909.58s)]
*  Maybe you don't want to open so if you're going to send him to prison leave him be where he is right now [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1916.34s)]
*  And what about you guys does this even factor in the safety of? [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1921.82s)]
*  these women [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1927.1s)]
*  What about the safety of Cassie Ventura and Jane and Mia who is another woman who testified against him under a pseudonym? [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1928.78s)]
*  But he knows very well who she is and who all these women are and I'm sorry [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1936.22s)]
*  But this is a man I believe blew up another man's car because he was dating [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1940.9399999999998s)]
*  Combs his [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1945.6599999999999s)]
*  girlfriend [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1947.2199999999998s)]
*  There I still have questions about how combs his first wife died [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1948.26s)]
*  I don't have evidence to show he killed her she died of pneumonia [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1951.8999999999999s)]
*  But it was very suspicious and if you believe the draft diary the alleged diary that hit YouTube [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1955.3s)]
*  Her friends the dead wife's friends believe he had something to do with it [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1961.78s)]
*  He was involved in this in shooting someone in the face in a nightclub and that victim says he did it [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1967.62s)]
*  Even though another man went to prison for it, but that man is saying did he paid him off to take the rap and [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1974.06s)]
*  We've heard weeks now seven weeks of testimony about how he's beaten these women to a pulp [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1980.42s)]
*  When he was allegedly in love with them [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1986.6200000000001s)]
*  Not when they were taking the stand in a federal trial against him trying to get him locked up for the rest of his life [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1989.78s)]
*  Does the judge consider that at all Arthur that he may be a danger if you let him out to these women? [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=1995.94s)]
*  It's the primary thing that he's gonna consume the two primary things are a danger to society and risk of flight [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2002.4199999999998s)]
*  It feels like a hundred percent correct. I mean [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2010.22s)]
*  If the judge is thinking about keeping him in like sentencing the jail time and I look I've been wrong more times [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2012.8999999999999s)]
*  I've been right. I'm gonna be shocked if he sentences them to like time served in five years probation, but you never know [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2019.26s)]
*  But yes dangerousness [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2026.54s)]
*  absolutely [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2028.86s)]
*  That's why I think if he does let him out, I think he's gonna he should [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2029.9s)]
*  Severely limit his ability to communicate outside of his like lawyering and his immediate family with a landline phone that can be monitored [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2035.74s)]
*  but but [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2043.9s)]
*  if human [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2045.5800000000002s)]
*  Instinct or common sense is gonna play a role [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2047.5s)]
*  I think it's fair to say that Sean had the life scared out of him like literally the life scared out of him because this judge [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2049.6600000000003s)]
*  If the prosecutor ran the table, I don't know if Sean comes was ever gonna see the light of day [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2056.8999999999996s)]
*  So, you know if I'm his lawyer and I've been in this position where I've gotten people cleared of major major crimes [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2062.22s)]
*  And I said listen the only way I'm gonna come and hit you in the head with a bat [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2068.16s)]
*  Is if you ever get in trouble again because don't tell me I put my family aside [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2070.9799999999996s)]
*  I put my life aside to save your backside and you're gonna do anything like this again [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2074.8199999999997s)]
*  I imagine there's gonna be a long-term relationship between marking niflo and Sean combs and [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2079.22s)]
*  Mark is gonna do everything he can to make sure that Sean [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2083.8999999999996s)]
*  His power is about to end he did he's just a cog in the wheel of the Sean combs empire [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2089.5s)]
*  He's nothing to Sean combs. He'll be grateful to him. He's not gonna have ongoing control over Sean combs [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2095.42s)]
*  No one has control over Sean combs [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2100.3799999999997s)]
*  That's what we learned in this case Phil that he's the whole alleged enterprise was set up to treat him like he was God [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2102.8199999999997s)]
*  There was testimony from you know, the one the one woman who worked for him that she was the one she had to be available 24 7 [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2111.26s)]
*  She was not allowed to sleep with a lock on her door in his home [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2117.6600000000003s)]
*  Whereas all the male employees could the security guards they could but her lock had to stay undone and he would go in there [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2121.02s)]
*  And she said [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2128.08s)]
*  Sexually assault her I realized these things are complicated was it did she say no at the time [[00:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2130.46s)]
*  Was she overwhelmed that it was Sean combs and she didn't say anything [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2135.6200000000003s)]
*  Is that fair to hold against him if she didn't we're all that's complicated. My point is simply [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2138.38s)]
*  Everybody was there to serve Sean combs and the reason he's behaved with impunity for all this time is because [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2143.42s)]
*  Everyone around him has let him that that hotel [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2150.5s)]
*  Intercontinental security guard took the money the head of security [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2153.94s)]
*  Blessed it and he took 50 grand and he gave 50 grand to the underling who then split his 50 with another guy [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2159.1800000000003s)]
*  There was only one honest guy of the bunch who didn't take the money the first guy on scene at the hotel [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2166.8199999999997s)]
*  Didn't take the money but did take out his phone and videotaped the hotel surveillance cameras because I [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2172.9799999999996s)]
*  He said he wanted to show it to his wife, but I'm sure he had a little feeling someone else might take the money [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2180.06s)]
*  That's the only reason CNN years later [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2185.5s)]
*  Got this tape and we and these jurors saw who Sean combs really is [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2188.9399999999996s)]
*  So it's just [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2195.6200000000003s)]
*  It I just don't think the lawyers not gonna have ongoing influence over this. Look at this guy this thug [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2197.1800000000003s)]
*  He's going to be thrilled. He's out. And if anything, I feel like he's gonna be feeling empowered that he's Sean [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2203.78s)]
*  Effing diddy combs and he got away [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2210.1800000000003s)]
*  again with felonies [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2212.98s)]
*  But they feel like the judge could have control over him [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2215.0600000000004s)]
*  I mean, I don't want to speak at a turn but the judge may be able to sentence him to five years [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2217.7400000000002s)]
*  Don't count [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2224.86s)]
*  consecutively or three years of probation [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2226.26s)]
*  He may be on probation for ten years where you know, it's a federal probation [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2228.26s)]
*  It could be pretty intensive. You know, you have to report once a week [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2233.38s)]
*  You have to I mean they could go to your house anytime unannounced [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2237.34s)]
*  They can give you a curfew whether the judge gives you a curfew or not some [[00:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2241.06s)]
*  28 year old probation officer can tell Sean combs [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2245.94s)]
*  I want you home every night at eight o'clock [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2248.7400000000002s)]
*  You can leave at eight o'clock in the morning and I really only want you to do in work events if you want to leave [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2250.46s)]
*  The jurisdiction of the Southern District of New York, which is basically the five boroughs a little bit upstate [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2256.06s)]
*  But it's not even the five boroughs, but two of the five, you know, you have to let me know [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2260.98s)]
*  So there are ways to keep an eye on Sean combs through the federal system again, which is no joke [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2265.9s)]
*  It's not like it's a walk in the park [[00:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2273.26s)]
*  It can be if you're a good guy who's never been in trouble and obeys all the rules and it was a money kind of case [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2276.2999999999997s)]
*  Yeah, they can be very lenient on you. But if they want to keep their thumb on you, they have the ability to do so [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2282.46s)]
*  And those are the I want to go ahead film [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2288.3399999999997s)]
*  That's exactly the argument I would be making to the judge if I were his lawyer trying to get him released and [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2290.98s)]
*  Sentenced to house arrest pending sentencing or and then arguing for a probation [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2297.2599999999998s)]
*  But look [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2301.82s)]
*  Unless a leopard can change its spots in the last nine or ten months while he's been in federal lockup [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2302.94s)]
*  I think that for all the reasons we've been talking about that video and in all the testimony of [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2308.9s)]
*  how he has basically kept his thumb on these women and [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2316.3s)]
*  kept them oppressed and and [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2322.6600000000003s)]
*  Subjugated them and used them to demonstrate how he was all-powerful and lording over every aspect of their lives [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2324.98s)]
*  For those reasons, I think they are still at risk from him [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2332.94s)]
*  Even if he is even if he's behind bars [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2337.5400000000004s)]
*  they might be at some risk from him in my opinion and so I think that the [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2339.9s)]
*  the the better and the safer course of action if you're the judge is to leave him in custody and then also [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2344.98s)]
*  To give him the maximum sentence that you can because the judge really should not talk about that Phil [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2351.18s)]
*  What what do you think it would likely be if the if the maximum you could get for the? [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2356.02s)]
*  transportation to engage in prostitution is [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2361.34s)]
*  Up to ten years in prison and he's been found guilty of two counts [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2363.5s)]
*  But has no criminal history that the court would look at and he does have a criminal history [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2368.1s)]
*  But it doesn't you know, as I said at the beginning arise to a certain level [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2372.38s)]
*  What what would you expect the judge to sentence him to? [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2375.42s)]
*  What would I expect or what would I do because you know if it were me I would very seriously considering [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2379.5s)]
*  Giving him the max and maybe even stacking them for a total 20 [[00:39:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2385.6200000000003s)]
*  I would take into consideration all of the things that we've seen in this trial whether it [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2389.26s)]
*  Something that amounted to a conviction or not the judge sat there and saw it and if the judge believed that that's the type of person [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2394.6600000000003s)]
*  He is then the judge would be justified in believing that he is in more need of [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2401.06s)]
*  Rehabilitation than someone who had not done all those things even if they're barred by the statute of limitations in California [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2406.46s)]
*  Now what I expect the judge to do is to kind of maybe split the difference because a lot of times we see that with [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2413.06s)]
*  Newbie judges they want to split the baby King Solomon type and say look. All right [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2419.2599999999998s)]
*  Well, the defense wants him to go home and straight probation. The prosecutor wants the max. I'm gonna do something in the middle [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2423.7799999999997s)]
*  Because I want to be seen as being fair because I'm still making my bones here in the federal judiciary [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2430.54s)]
*  So I think I would expect the judge to do something [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2435.98s)]
*  Probably in the middle [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2439.7400000000002s)]
*  What do you think? I don't think that's out of the end Meg. I can just tell you this [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2441.46s)]
*  We're talking about the lawyering and all of that and I'll make it a little personal, right? [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2445.7000000000003s)]
*  So the Weinstein case, right? We beat the top charge, but he's still facing basically like the prison because he's 73 years old [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2449.5800000000004s)]
*  With cancer heart disease and diabetes [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2457.3s)]
*  But he hasn't been sentenced yet [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2459.0600000000004s)]
*  If he gets sentenced to something where he could see the light at the end of the tunnel in two years and three years in [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2460.6200000000003s)]
*  New York then you know what I did my job because I was handed a case that was sentenced to 23 years [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2466.3s)]
*  Which was he was it was the death penalty and I gave him an opportunity if he could stay healthy in prison [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2471.82s)]
*  He could get out. Of course, he's got to win the California appeal the same thing holds true here [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2477.34s)]
*  Although we all agree [[00:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2481.86s)]
*  This is a huge victory for the defense attorneys if the judge does what Phil says it says I think you're a pretty [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2482.86s)]
*  Despicable what you pissed in a woman's mouth until she was gagging like I'm sorry, sir [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2490.78s)]
*  I can't get that out of my mind [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2496.26s)]
*  So I'm sentencing you to 10 years on one a 10 years on Cassie [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2497.78s)]
*  Cuz that's who you pissed in her mouth and five on the other and I'm running them consecutively [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2502.82s)]
*  Which means he's got to do like a dozen years [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2506.6600000000003s)]
*  Then even though the lawyers did the best they could I don't think Sean is gonna look at doing 12 years in prison as a victory [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2509.66s)]
*  So the the the book the last chapter in this book has not been written yet [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2515.66s)]
*  When when I know you got to run Arthur but quickly when you get sentenced in federal court, do you have to serve the whole sentence? [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2521.2599999999998s)]
*  85% I'm pretty sure 85% [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2527.98s)]
*  There's some stuff that Trump put in the first first step back [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2531.06s)]
*  But it doesn't apply to sex crimes a lot of the ways to get out of prison early we represent Delaine Maxwell [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2534.1s)]
*  We're trying to at least get her into a nicer facility [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2540.42s)]
*  We're not even asking to be released just to get her out of a maximum facility [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2543.52s)]
*  But when you're when you're convicted of a sex crime, a lot of the rules go out the window [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2547.5s)]
*  Hmm. Okay. Thank you for your analysis. I know you got a run. Thanks for doing this. All the best [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2552.9s)]
*  Thank you. No problem. Great. Great. I feel more coming in here [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2557.06s)]
*  This is from the New York Times what happened during the verdict as the not guilty verdicts for the sex trafficking counts came [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2561.74s)]
*  On which he was found out guilty members of his family and his legal team [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2567.46s)]
*  Began to cry when the full verdict had been read. Mr. Combs turned to his family and mouthed. I'm going home and [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2571.46s)]
*  Yeah, it may be and then let me give you another piece CNN reports that Cassie Ventura's lawyer Douglas Wigdor [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2578.86s)]
*  I know him well [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2585.9s)]
*  That he gave the following statement [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2588.18s)]
*  This case proved that change is long overdue [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2590.7s)]
*  Cassie Ventura paved the way for a jury to find Sean Diddy combs guilty on some of the counts against him [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2594.5s)]
*  The entire criminal process this entire criminal process started when our client Cassie Ventura had the courage to file her civil complaint in November [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2599.7799999999997s)]
*  2023 although the jury did not find combs guilty of sex trafficking Cassie beyond a reasonable doubt [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2607.4199999999996s)]
*  She paved the way for a jury to find him guilty of transportation to engage in prostitution [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2611.8199999999997s)]
*  He continued by coming forward with her experience Cassie has left an indelible mark on both the entertainment industry in the fight for justice [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2616.22s)]
*  her exemplary courage throughout the trial [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2622.7s)]
*  Brought attention to the realities of powerful men in our orbit and the misconduct that has persisted for decades without repercussions [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2626.54s)]
*  Repercussion I've got to say the only part of that that strikes me as real as the last one [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2632.58s)]
*  Where yes, if she hadn't come forward he wouldn't have been exposed. That is true, but [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2636.9399999999996s)]
*  It's it's a sweet lawyer trying to spin her courage in taking the stand as some sort of a win and it just wasn't [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2642.82s)]
*  It just wasn't a win. They barely believed anything she said or if they did [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2650.34s)]
*  They just didn't think it was a legal problem. They didn't think it rose to the level of criminality [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2656.38s)]
*  They appear to have bought the defense's argument on Cassie not the prosecution's fell [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2661.5800000000004s)]
*  Yeah, it seems that it seems that her words that she has used that [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2666.5s)]
*  expressed and I'm just generalizing and putting just putting it all together her words that [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2671.98s)]
*  Whether it was text messages or other that indicated that she was something of a willing participant [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2677.42s)]
*  In fact eager to participate in some of this [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2682.7000000000003s)]
*  I can see I don't this is not my belief [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2685.5800000000004s)]
*  But I can see how a jury might see that might believe that [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2688.7000000000003s)]
*  This is a little bit of buyer's remorse by her and that she sees things differently [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2692.54s)]
*  Through the lens of hindsight then it really was when all this was going on and and we spoke about reasonable doubt [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2697.22s)]
*  And if you're on the jury and the judge says if you have a doubt for which a reason can be attached it is your [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2703.9399999999996s)]
*  duty to [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2710.14s)]
*  acquit [[00:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2711.4599999999996s)]
*  Then if the jurors are following those instructions, you know [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2712.3399999999997s)]
*  That means a lot and if you're in the jury room and you say look well [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2715.8399999999997s)]
*  I think he's a bad guy and he probably did, you know pressure her [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2718.7s)]
*  But she she made these statements then and she expressed some willingness to be there so according to the judge [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2722.3799999999997s)]
*  This is a doubt in my brain [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2729.2999999999997s)]
*  I've got a duty to acquit on that charge and I think that's really probably the best way to [[00:45:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2730.8999999999996s)]
*  Explain it and it's also true by the way that had she not been willing to come forward and testify [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2736.22s)]
*  We will we wouldn't have had this trial and we wouldn't have the convictions that we do have back to what you were saying [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2741.2599999999998s)]
*  I don't know who you said reported this but somebody was reporting that he's waving his fist saying I'm coming home [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2747.98s)]
*  That might be a little bit premature [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2754.02s)]
*  And I don't know if his lawyers have maybe told him that okay if you if it's just these counts [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2756.1s)]
*  That's a time serve thing if that if that's the case. He might be [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2762.38s)]
*  prematurely celebrating [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2766.98s)]
*  His release. I'm not so sure that's going to happen [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2768.94s)]
*  Mm-hmm, right because we're gonna find out we think today around 1 p.m [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2772.58s)]
*  What the judge is going to do at least in between now and sentencing like how long does it normally take between? [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2776.56s)]
*  The guilty verdict and the sentencing is there any chance that we have to do all the reports and all that [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2783.08s)]
*  There's no way where he's getting sentenced today at one. It's just about whether he stays in jail pending sentencing [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2788.14s)]
*  No in the state system a lot of times you can move straight into sentencing, but not I don't expect that in this case [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2793.0s)]
*  There will be a pre-sentence investigation [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2798.6s)]
*  And it's entirely in the judge's discretion, but I'd say in roughly a month [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2801.2400000000002s)]
*  Give or take they'll be back maybe two [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2805.92s)]
*  they'll be back for the sentencing after which time the judge can take advantage of the [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2808.76s)]
*  Reports that have been generated by the probation department [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2814.2000000000003s)]
*  Looking in at not only the things that happened in the trial, but other things related to his background [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2818.12s)]
*  They really do a deep dive and present all of it to the judge and they actually might make a recommendation as well [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2823.94s)]
*  It's not binding on the court [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2829.88s)]
*  And you better believe that during the intervening time [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2832.08s)]
*  the both the prosecutor and the defense they're going to be asked to submit something called a [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2836.08s)]
*  Sentencing memorandum, which is where you? [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2843.64s)]
*  Lay out your case to the judge in writing as to what? [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2846.6800000000003s)]
*  sentence you're seeking and why and why it factors into the guidelines and is supported by law and [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2850.32s)]
*  Those things I would imagine each side may have already gotten a head start at least drafting it or at least [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2857.28s)]
*  Laying out the structure of it, but you know that could be several pages long those documents can be [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2863.74s)]
*  You know four or five or six pages or could be you know a little bit longer depending on the circumstances [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2869.62s)]
*  But those have to be prepared submitted reviewed so all those things are going to take several weeks to to to make it happen [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2874.7799999999997s)]
*  As and as we've been talking about yeah, it's going to take a while so I got to say this [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2882.46s)]
*  Today at one is going to be an epic moment in [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2887.0800000000004s)]
*  Legal news across the United States of America because we may find out yes [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2890.8s)]
*  This is interesting whether he stays in jail pending the sentencing by this judge [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2895.44s)]
*  And we are also going to hear Brian Kohlberger [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2899.96s)]
*  We believe say he is guilty of quadruple murder in Idaho [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2902.8s)]
*  Which will be on camera and we will be showing it to the audience in full so in our last minute together Phil [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2907.6600000000003s)]
*  Your thoughts on the Kohlberger plea [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2914.96s)]
*  So I am in the camp that the Kohlberger plea deal is [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2917.4s)]
*  preposterous I think that unless you've got all of the families on board with it and that you've [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2922.7200000000003s)]

*  overwhelming I think the only reason to [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2935.86s)]
*  Take the death penalty off the table and to take a plea deal is if the families were lobbying for it [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2938.96s)]
*  I understand that the families here were split some wanted it some didn't and you know [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2945.64s)]

*  But if you've got a rock-solid case, and you don't have all the families on board with it [[00:49:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=2954.2400000000002s)]

*  Court TV reporting that people were lining up at 4 a.m. Outside of the courthouse to try to get a seat inside [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3589.08s)]
*  It's one of those cases that has captured the attention of the nation just because it's so horrific [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3595.96s)]
*  I mean my kids know about this one, you know, my your kids don't normally get into true crime, but [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3601.7599999999998s)]

*  The normal bounds of what you understand a human's capable of we know that there are murderers [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3627.44s)]
*  We know that there are serial killers. We know that there are [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3632.04s)]
*  Horrible men out there who will torture people. I mean, it's sometimes women, but let's face it the vast majority are men and [[01:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3635.4s)]

*  I mean the whole thing was so bizarre and he was well on his way toward having a successful life [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3663.36s)]
*  his [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3669.2000000000003s)]

*  she sat down with Brian Enton of News Nation last night and was [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3704.04s)]
*  Fascinating the whole thing was fascinating including her talking about well [[01:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3709.8s)]
*  Let's just go through it as we wait for the live feed to come from this Idaho courtroom [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3714.92s)]
*  She starts off by saying what her initial impression of Kohlberger was stop 42. What was your? [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3719.76s)]
*  perception of him [[01:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3729.04s)]
*  He seemed like eager to be in the classroom. He was polite. He was respectful [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3730.92s)]
*  intense and [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3739.36s)]
*  curious and [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3741.36s)]
*  There was no reason for me to think that he was anything other than someone who was really interested in this potential career [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3743.1800000000003s)]
*  Okay, that's how she kicked it off and then she got to what it was like when she found out he'd been charged and [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3753.2000000000003s)]
*  Whether she looks back now on what she taught him in a different way [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3760.1200000000003s)]
*  I'm gonna bring in our panel as we wait now again. It's Matt Murphy. Matt's a former homicide prosecutor lifetime [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3765.28s)]
*  That's how he spent his adult years putting terrible people in jail [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3772.0s)]
*  So good on him an author of the book the book of murder and Howard Bloom who is the [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3775.0400000000004s)]
*  Journalist to follow on this case since the very beginning [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3780.84s)]
*  He's also the author of the book when the night comes falling a requiem for the Idaho student murders [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3783.52s)]
*  Which is now out in paperback highly recommend if you have any interest in this case [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3789.6400000000003s)]
*  Matt Howard, welcome back. Thank you for being here [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3793.7599999999998s)]
*  Let me just give you another additional bit of color [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3798.24s)]
*  Brian Enton reporting from News Nation in Idaho in the line outside the courtroom waiting to go in [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3800.8799999999997s)]
*  They have us up against the wall to make room for the victims families as they walk by to enter [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3807.12s)]
*  Everyone is silent. I'm so sad for them [[01:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3812.9199999999996s)]
*  You can only imagine [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3816.2s)]
*  The level of decorum you would try to offer these families [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3818.3599999999997s)]
*  As they walk into that courtroom, I mean the [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3822.36s)]
*  The amount of sobriety you would try to bring to that moment as a as an onlooker as a journalist as a lawyer [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3826.2000000000003s)]
*  Matt you've been there. You've been the prosecutor in this exact circumstance [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3833.28s)]
*  Would try to try to set the scene for us [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3838.8s)]
*  Well, this is obviously a [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3843.7200000000003s)]
*  tremendously somber moment [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3846.2400000000002s)]
*  the prosecution outlined some [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3848.32s)]
*  Some good points on why you might offer a plea for a case like this [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3851.04s)]
*  The appellate process goes on forever. That's true [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3857.68s)]
*  The the families have to go through it and trial. Of course, that's true, but that's the case in every single murder [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3861.48s)]
*  They're all brutal and if you know, you give the family a heads up as a prosecutor [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3868.68s)]
*  But have them having them come in one of the things that's disturbing to me about this case Megan [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3873.04s)]
*  Of course is the disconnect that appears to have taken place between the prosecution and at least they can solve as family and [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3878.34s)]
*  In a in a word that really should never happen [[01:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3886.1000000000004s)]
*  Sometimes it's unavoidable. It appears that certainly some of these family members are on board with this plea again [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3890.6600000000003s)]
*  There's good reasons for that [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3896.5s)]
*  But every family Megan is that you deal with on a in a murder case is somewhere on a spectrum [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3897.9s)]
*  between [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3905.94s)]
*  Profound sadness and profound anger and they they all sort of wind up and they can they evolve over time typically [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3906.98s)]
*  and [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3914.3s)]
*  Mr. Gonzales clearly and I think for the entire penance of this case has been very much on the anger side of the spectrum [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3915.82s)]
*  Like you said who can blame them? [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3921.94s)]
*  but [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3924.46s)]
*  There there are different rules in Idaho than many other states that have what's called Marcy's law and in California [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3925.42s)]
*  for example [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3932.34s)]
*  The [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3933.14s)]
*  family has a constitutional right the immediate family members to address the court to [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3934.22s)]
*  to address the defendant and to talk about the impact that this had on their family and [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3939.2999999999997s)]
*  This is one of those things that we are just or just before sentencing at the pleading [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3945.3399999999997s)]
*  I like the day that he cops the plea or at the sentencing [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3949.5s)]
*  Under Marcy's law, which is also known as the victims bill of rights [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3952.8199999999997s)]
*  They have a right to address the court each and every time there is a significant event in a courtroom [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3955.7799999999997s)]
*  So any oh wow [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3961.06s)]
*  significant [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3963.34s)]
*  Procedural event in a courtroom the family has the right to address the judge and to address the defendant if they're present [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3964.66s)]
*  So and it's a powerful thing Idaho [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3971.38s)]
*  Attempted to adopt this in 2019 and they didn't for whatever reason and and you can you can mark my words on this [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3975.22s)]
*  I predict after this case [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3981.2999999999997s)]
*  There's gonna be a renewed push to adopt Marcy's law in the state of Idaho [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3983.58s)]
*  We don't know exactly what to expect when it comes to the family Howard your thoughts on this we haven't gotten your [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3988.02s)]
*  Opinion urge to talk to you since the news broke that he's cutting. Yes. I mean, I think the prosecution made a [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=3993.86s)]
*  Very pragmatic but ultimately cynical decision. I mean all along in this case [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4002.02s)]
*  We've seen the authorities in Idaho trying to move on [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4007.26s)]
*  Remember a judge judge he couldn't wait to leave the case to get off of it [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4011.58s)]
*  Then when judge Hippler came in the first thing he said his first day in the courtroom [[01:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4016.34s)]
*  I'd like to say I'm happy to be here, but I'm not and then the University of Idaho [[01:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4020.38s)]
*  They wanted the whole town to forget about it [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4024.98s)]
*  They they insisted that the murder house should be torn down and then you had chief fry who was wrong. Sorry to interrupt you Howard [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4026.9s)]

*  The ability for them to get work done not only in this case, but in other cases where defendants [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4140.08s)]
*  are entitled to [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4147.200000000001s)]
*  Have their cases processed and frankly as important if not more so for victims to have their cases [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4151.84s)]
*  processed in those cases [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4160.0s)]
*  It's also highly inappropriate [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4162.56s)]
*  A court is not supposed to and this court will never take into account [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4165.52s)]
*  public sentiment [[01:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4171.52s)]
*  In making an opinion regarding its judicial decisions in cases [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4174.160000000001s)]
*  Court should and I always will make decisions based on where the facts and the law lead me [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4182.320000000001s)]
*  period I [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4189.120000000001s)]
*  Have not read any of the numerous messages nor listen to any of the numerous voicemails [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4190.6s)]
*  That have been sent to me and my staff those have all been forward to security and where appropriate to law enforcement [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4196.84s)]
*  I [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4204.64s)]
*  Asked that you not continue to mount such campaigns or to send me information [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4206.120000000001s)]
*  Like this because again it is not appropriate and frankly not something I would take into account [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4212.320000000001s)]
*  when deciding a [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4217.72s)]
*  Matter in a case like this I [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4220.2s)]
*  Also want people to understand some very basic concepts about the ideas of separation of powers [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4224.6s)]
*  what the court's duties are and what the duties and the rights of the [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4230.4400000000005s)]
*  Executive or in this case the prosecuting attorney is [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4236.08s)]
*  The executive the elected prosecutor is the sole authority in deciding what charges to pursue [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4242.6s)]
*  Including whether [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4250.280000000001s)]
*  As well as what penalties to ask for and what penalties to pursue including the death penalty [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4252.96s)]
*  This court cannot require the prosecutor to seek the death penalty [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4262.92s)]
*  Nor would it be appropriate for this court to attempt to do that? [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4267.84s)]
*  this court in considering a [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4273.16s)]
*  plea agreement [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4276.360000000001s)]
*  If it were to reject this plea agreement cannot force the state to seek the death penalty [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4278.0s)]
*  My role and power in considering a plea agreement is extremely limited [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4288.8s)]
*  My role is to ensure that the defendant's plea is given freely voluntarily and intelligently [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4294.32s)]
*  If those things are met I can only reject a plea such as the one in this case where I'm not being asked to agree to [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4301.08s)]
*  the sentence [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4309.04s)]
*  in advance [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4311.32s)]
*  if I [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4313.72s)]
*  Can only reject it for example if the defendant does not meet or admit to all the elements of the crime [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4315.72s)]
*  That is I can ensure I can ensure what is called a factual basis to the plea [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4324.8s)]
*  I [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4330.84s)]
*  Finally I want to offer my apologies to all the families [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4333.8s)]
*  including the victims families the families of the defendant [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4339.6s)]
*  For the short notice for today's hearing and I'm sure what must have been the hurried [[01:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4344.04s)]
*  efforts to get here I [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4349.08s)]
*  like most everyone else learned of this plea agreement [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4351.44s)]
*  Monday afternoon and had no inkling of it beforehand [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4356.6s)]
*  Prior to that time I was under the belief that this case was proceeding to trial as had been indicated and my staff and I were [[01:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4363.56s)]
*  Busy continuing to work on preparations to have potentially 10,000 citizens of Ada County come to jury duty [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4371.0s)]
*  starting in mid-july [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4378.6s)]
*  With the questionnaire process in mid-july [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4382.64s)]
*  It was once I learned of the defendant's decision to change his plea in this case [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4386.4800000000005s)]
*  It was important that I take the plea as soon as possible [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4393.2s)]
*  Because of the extraordinarily administrative extraordinary administrative efforts that were otherwise [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4397.4400000000005s)]
*  Attendant to the process of this getting this trial [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4403.320000000001s)]
*  Potentially underway on time [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4409.360000000001s)]
*  And including the significant process of bringing [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4412.24s)]
*  Again potentially up to 10,000 jurors to come in and fill out juror questionnaires [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4415.88s)]
*  prior to the beginning of the vordire process and [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4421.36s)]
*  So it was important that we if we're going to go down this road do so [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4428.16s)]
*  Expeditiously so that we can avoid those costs and expenses [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4436.32s)]
*  Associated with that [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4441.92s)]
*  Otherwise if it was not going to result in a plea or for some reason the plea were to fall through today that we could continue [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4444.759999999999s)]
*  Diligently towards trial at the time specified and [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4451.839999999999s)]
*  so that obviously required that we act quickly and [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4455.92s)]
*  So some folks may have not had the amount of time that we would otherwise [[01:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4461.5599999999995s)]
*  Allow for for them to travel here [[01:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4467.04s)]
*  And so again, I apologize for that I [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4469.84s)]
*  Want to [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4474.8s)]
*  Make people aware that during the hearing if you are to leave the courtroom for any reason you will not be readmitted during the hearing [[01:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4477.88s)]
*  Also when we finish the hearing this morning [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4487.76s)]
*  I ask that the public and media wait in their seats until the victims families and the defendant's families and [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4489.84s)]
*  Others are escorted out of the courtroom before you start to leave [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4497.12s)]
*  Finally I want to acknowledge the trial court administrator and her staff the Ada County sheriff and Ada County [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4505.76s)]
*  fourth district marshal service for the huge lift that they have accomplished in preparing for and orchestrating this hearing today [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4512.360000000001s)]
*  As well as to all the security attendant today [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4519.68s)]
*  That you see and some of whom you [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4523.06s)]
*  Many of whom you don't see with less than 48 hours notice and so I appreciate the hard work that they've been doing [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4525.3s)]
*  Frankly some of them while they were on some vacation [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4533.22s)]
*  Prior to the trial starting and had to call that short and so I appreciate very much their professionalism [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4536.78s)]
*  and dedication [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4543.1s)]
*  all right, that said let's [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4544.86s)]
*  move to the business of today I [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4548.14s)]
*  I understand the state and the defense have reached a plea agreement in this case [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4551.34s)]
*  For the record I [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4560.860000000001s)]
*  Have a written plea agreement which indicates in some [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4563.22s)]
*  Defendant will plead guilty to all five counts in the indictment burglary [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4568.9400000000005s)]
*  felony and first-degree murder four counts [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4575.66s)]
*  The state and the defendant stipulate [[01:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4580.900000000001s)]
*  That is that the defense is not free to argue for a lesser sentence at sentencing to the following [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4584.06s)]
*  the defendant on the burglary charge will be sentenced to ten years fixed and [[01:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4590.9800000000005s)]
*  That the defendant on counts two through five the four counts of first-degree homicide on each count would receive a fixed life sentence [[01:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4596.3s)]
*  All five of those counts to run consecutive to one another [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4604.42s)]
*  Defendant as part of the plea agreement waives his right to appeal [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4608.5s)]
*  as well as his right to appeal the sentence and his right to seek a [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4614.46s)]
*  leniency or reconsideration of the sentence under Idaho criminal rule 35 [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4620.099999999999s)]
*  This is not a rule 11 agreement meaning the court is not bound by the plea agreement and could [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4629.78s)]
*  Impose a different lawful sentence at sentencing [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4636.82s)]
*  The stipulated agreement in the parties is the maximum on each count [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4640.38s)]
*  So theoretically the only thing the court could do would be a lesser sentence at [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4644.38s)]
*  Sentencing but the defendant is not free to ask the court to do so under the plea agreement [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4649.3s)]
*  Are there any other material terms of the plea agreement that the parties would like to make? [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4654.7s)]
*  Obviously the plea agreement the written plea agreement will speak for itself to be part of the court record [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4659.86s)]
*  Not from the state your honor. Thank you [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4664.22s)]
*  No, your honor. Thank you [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4667.02s)]
*  All right [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4674.66s)]

*  I have your honor have you discussed fully with him his rights defenses and possible consequences to him of the guilty plea [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4685.34s)]
*  Yes, your honor. Have you been able to do all the discovery you feel necessary? [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4692.86s)]

*  Yes, you consent to the entry of the plea today. I do [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4712.22s)]
*  All right, mr. Kohlberger. I need to ask you some questions this afternoon or I guess it's this morning still I do this [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4715.7s)]
*  To ensure that you understand so that I am assured that you understand the nature of the charges to which I understand [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4723.7s)]

*  And I want to make sure that you actually committed the crimes to which you're pleading guilty because I don't want you to plead [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4738.02s)]
*  Guilty to a crime you didn't commit if you attempt to plead guilty today, but for some reason I don't accept your plea then it is [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4743.18s)]
*  Possible that your statements today could be used against you later at trial. Do you understand that? [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4750.9400000000005s)]
*  Yes, all right. Thank you and now while you're standing actually, why don't you take the oath from the clerk? [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4756.660000000001s)]

*  Before I start asking questions today have you consumed [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4790.22s)]
*  Substance of questions. Let me ask you have you consumed any alcohol drug or other intoxicating substance that would impair your ability to understand or [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4794.740000000001s)]
*  exercise reasonable judgment [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4802.9400000000005s)]
*  No, you feel like you are thinking clearly today. Yes [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4805.18s)]
*  All right. I want you to understand what the possible penalties are for each of the crimes to which I understand [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=4809.1s)]

*  It matched the DNA found on the knife sheath next to Maddie's body at the crime scene. I [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6221.72s)]
*  Can tell the court in public the weapon itself the knife has not yet been recovered. I [[01:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6229.8s)]
*  Can tell the court that the defendant's apartment and Pullman was searched as well as his office [[01:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6236.92s)]
*  Spartan would be a kind characterization. There was virtually nothing there. Nothing of evidentiary value was found and [[01:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6243.36s)]

*  I [[01:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6265.96s)]
*  Think we can all look to our own cars, you know in those compartments in the doors [[01:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6267.68s)]

*  the state [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6282.0s)]
*  Would present to the jury that that was part of the defendant's plan and covering up this the defendant has studied crime [[01:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6283.24s)]
*  In fact, he did a detailed paper on crime scene processing [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6291.62s)]
*  When he was working on his pre-doctorate degrees and he had that knowledge and skill [[01:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6295.92s)]

*  the state submits that the evidence that I've given just quick overview of [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6303.96s)]

*  all in one day [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6523.16s)]
*  Defense agree with that in terms of the time frame yes, your honor [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6525.88s)]
*  All right [[01:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6531.28s)]
*  So as it happens we have some time reserved in this case in July and August [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6532.759999999999s)]
*  The week of July 22nd is available. I don't know if that's too soon for the parties or [[01:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6541.36s)]
*  The next week the week of August 4 is available [[01:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6548.12s)]
*  any preference [[01:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6552.12s)]

*  The state I believe would be here on the 22nd. We've told the victims families that we're looking at approximately those states all right, so [[01:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6558.0s)]
*  Because of the plan to bring in so many jurors to fill out questionnaires I had [[01:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6566.16s)]
*  Ordered that no other trials could take place in this courthouse the week of July 22nd [[01:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6572.280000000001s)]
*  and so we will use that in terms of [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6579.4800000000005s)]
*  the sentencing date because of what I'm sure will be the significant interest of the media and the public and [[01:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6582.76s)]
*  the [[01:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6590.56s)]
*  Logistics that will be required to make that happen [[01:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6593.72s)]
*  And [[01:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6596.64s)]
*  Without trials going it'll be a lot easier to do that, so let's pick that week. Why don't we pick July? [[01:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6597.92s)]
*  23rd [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6604.360000000001s)]
*  With the idea that if for some reason we don't finish we could continue into the 24th [[01:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6605.72s)]
*  We'll start at 9 in the morning [[01:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6611.4800000000005s)]
*  That gave your team enough time Sandra 9 in the morning all right [[01:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6616.160000000001s)]
*  Any concerns with that date no your honor. Thank you no sir all right [[01:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6621.72s)]
*  I [[01:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6626.64s)]
*  Any reason why I should not rescind it on dissemination order at this time [[01:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6630.96s)]
*  Your I I think that given the history of this case it would be best if that remain in place through sentencing so [[01:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6636.400000000001s)]
*  we have [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6643.6s)]
*  time to make sure there's a [[01:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6644.92s)]
*  The ability to completely answer questions [[01:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6647.4800000000005s)]
*  That would be the state's preference and recommendation [[01:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6651.0s)]
*  We'd have no objection for the order to remain in place I will at this point the idea to keep it until [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6653.88s)]
*  Sentencing which time it would be withdrawn [[01:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6665.599999999999s)]
*  In order to give the parties the space and time to prepare to meet that what I'm sure will be the deluge of [[01:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6671.12s)]
*  media requests [[01:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6679.2s)]
*  That's at least my preliminary decision at this point we can always revisit if it seems to be [[01:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6682.2s)]
*  For some reason I should that said [[01:51:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6690.48s)]
*  Obviously I don't think the defendant a bond was ever set for the defendant [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6696.88s)]
*  Were it it would be revoked the prior order allowing him to come in civilian clothes is revoked [[01:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6701.76s)]
*  Given his plea and no longer the presumption of innocence and in fact now the actual conviction for the crimes [[01:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6708.12s)]
*  He will continue to be held at the jail pending sentencing is there anything else today? [[01:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6714.96s)]
*  No your honor. Thank you. I [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6721.36s)]
*  Assume the trial date will be they did try out his or jurors will be released the trial will be vacated and I'm [[01:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6724.24s)]

*  Just awful yes, yes [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6915.5s)]
*  Yes, like a student taking an oral exam [[01:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6918.42s)]
*  He's got all the answers and he can comfort himself at having them for the rest of his life as he rots in prison [[01:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6921.14s)]
*  Which is a fate too good for Brian Kohlberger bringing back Mac Matt Murphy and Howard Bloom Wow [[01:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6927.92s)]
*  Matt I'll start with you on it. It's not your first rodeo seeing something like that. What did you make of what we just witnessed? [[01:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6934.0s)]
*  I'm kind of frustrated actually [[01:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6941.88s)]
*  I [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6945.08s)]
*  sat on our death penalty [[01:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6946.28s)]
*  special circumstance committee for 15 years in Orange County and [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6948.4400000000005s)]
*  Essentially what you do in a special stroke murder like this [[01:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6952.16s)]
*  Special circumstances murder is you go through the law piece by piece and you you weigh the aggravating versus mitigating [[01:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6955.5199999999995s)]
*  Circumstances and you go through those very carefully. What are the factors in aggravation? [[01:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6963.92s)]
*  What are the factors in mitigation and from that we would make a recommendation to the elected DA [[01:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6968.24s)]
*  Who then makes a very somber decision whether or not to seek the death penalty or life without possibility of parole? [[01:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6973.24s)]
*  We only sought death in less over the course of those 15 years less than 4% of the cases Megan [[01:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6979.72s)]
*  This case screams out for the death penalty. So my big question here is what changed? [[01:56:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6986.320000000001s)]
*  Because it's unethical to file a death enhancement or to seek the death penalty with the idea that you are extracting a plea [[01:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6992.6s)]
*  And I'm not saying this prosecutor did that but when you hear the evidence [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=6999.6s)]
*  For me listening to the fact that he got a K bar on Amazon before we moved out [[01:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7003.8s)]
*  I think that's a new fact. I knew about the phones. I knew about the rest of it. This is an overwhelming case [[01:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7009.36s)]
*  So again what changed other than him deciding other than Kovrig or asking to plead guilty that changed the assessment that this was a death [[01:56:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7015.28s)]
*  penalty case and and it is at the end and I don't like to [[01:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7022.96s)]
*  Being a prosecutor is a tough job. I acknowledge that I did it for 26 years. So I'm I'm reluctant to criticize [[01:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7029.16s)]
*  You know because it is a tough position but if he choked up at the end [[01:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7036.400000000001s)]
*  I think that we listened to the DA choke up at the end. He did as he talked about that [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7040.92s)]
*  It's like dude, you gave this guy a break and we didn't hear one single thing that changed in your assessment between the aggravating [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7045.32s)]
*  And the mitigating factors we didn't hear anything [[01:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7052.52s)]
*  We didn't hear anything about a new story of abuse some piece of evidence that wasn't going to be admitted [[01:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7054.92s)]
*  Nothing changed and one of those families is is irate [[01:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7059.56s)]
*  And [[01:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7064.04s)]
*  You don't it's like the old saying there's no crying in baseball. There's no crying in [[01:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7066.04s)]
*  When you're in the prosecution business and you're talking about the slaughter of four innocent kids when you're giving the defendant a break [[01:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7071.16s)]
*  The big winner today. I hate to say it is Ryan Kovriger and um, I am [[01:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7078.04s)]
*  I'm just I was frustrated listening to that and I I got no problem calling him out [[01:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7083.400000000001s)]
*  I got no problem calling him out. Um, unless there was something that changed behind the scenes that we didn't hear about today. I think um [[01:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7088.44s)]
*  I think that they should have proceeded with the death penalty [[01:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7096.04s)]
*  Well said nothing changed howard nothing changed other than brian kovriger's willingness to take the plea [[01:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7098.679999999999s)]
*  It is such a cynical decision on the part of the state to make this plea bargain and during the course of the recitation by [[01:58:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7105.799999999999s)]
*  Thompson he kept on saying things [[01:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7114.759999999999s)]
*  So many things we don't know he said for whatever reason we don't know exactly why he did this [[01:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7117.72s)]
*  Uh the state the evidence suggests these are answers that we will never get that the families more importantly will never get [[01:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7122.84s)]
*  I think they need to know this [[01:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7130.84s)]
*  It was a very dramatic moment and ultimately very disappointing moment [[01:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7134.12s)]
*  Even the state's decision to keep the gag order in place [[01:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7138.76s)]
*  They're trying to keep this quiet for as long as they can to get this over with and then move on [[01:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7142.599999999999s)]
*  Move on that's been the you know from the beginning of this case [[01:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7148.5199999999995s)]
*  They were in rush to tear down the house where the murders occurred [[01:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7152.28s)]
*  The judge himself who took this case hitler said i'm not happy to be here [[01:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7156.36s)]
*  I wish I could say I was but i'm not judge judge quickly got off of it [[01:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7160.679999999999s)]
*  The original judge the chief of police retired as soon as he could [[01:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7165.0s)]
*  Uh [[01:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7169.5599999999995s)]
*  This is not a political cover-up, but it's sort of a benign neglect [[01:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7170.759999999999s)]
*  Let's I move on let idaho forget this but the reality is the state the town [[01:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7175.16s)]
*  The surviving families they will never forget this and I think they've been done a real injustice by the state [[01:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7181.48s)]
*  Totally agree. They they deserved the trial [[01:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7187.719999999999s)]
*  That they were promised that they were entitled to they deserve to see the witnesses take the stand [[01:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7191.639999999999s)]
*  And have the actual evidence the overwhelming evidence [[01:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7197.0s)]
*  Presented against him so that there'd be zero doubt in anybody's mind [[02:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7200.360000000001s)]
*  We deserved it. We deserve to see him sentenced to death if the death penalty is not appropriate for brian colberger [[02:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7204.200000000001s)]
*  Who is it appropriate for? [[02:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7211.08s)]
*  for innocence [[02:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7213.16s)]
*  Three of whom were asleep in their beds with zero chance of even fighting back [[02:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7215.0s)]
*  He murdered them at the prime of their life with it all in front of them [[02:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7220.92s)]
*  Who's the death penalty for idaho has the death penalty they believe in the death penalty [[02:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7224.759999999999s)]
*  Because of that prosecutor who wants us to feel that he does empathize with the victim's family with that choking up at the very end part [[02:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7229.4s)]
*  It was in his hands matt [[02:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7237.32s)]
*  He could have said no the only thing that changed i've been reading non-stop about it since we found out that there was a deal [[02:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7238.839999999999s)]
*  The only thing that changed was the circumstances on the defense side none of the proof [[02:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7243.88s)]
*  Ann taylor's attempt to get the death penalty off the table failed [[02:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7248.839999999999s)]
*  Ann taylor's attempt howard and i've been talking about this for two years now to get um the dna evidence thrown out because there was [[02:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7252.84s)]
*  Some like t's weren't perfectly crossed and i's weren't perfectly dotted in finding that hit in the dna database [[02:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7259.96s)]
*  Her challenge to that failed ann taylor's attempt at the last minute to bring in four other names as possible suspects [[02:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7266.120000000001s)]
*  Failed when the judge said there's zero evidence those people did it and in fact [[02:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7272.280000000001s)]
*  DNA and fingerprint tests have been done on them and they have nothing to do with this case only when ann taylor realized [[02:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7275.96s)]
*  She didn't have a shot at disproving [[02:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7282.04s)]
*  Anything at really poking holes in the prosecution's case [[02:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7284.52s)]
*  Did she go to them on friday and say make us an offer and he did and what you're saying is [[02:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7287.64s)]
*  a prosecutor [[02:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7293.56s)]
*  Who knows he has a good case would nine times out of ten and has the right to say [[02:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7295.72s)]
*  I will not make you a deal. The deal is he can plead guilty and be subjected to the death penalty [[02:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7300.92s)]
*  Yeah, not nine times out of ten megan [[02:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7307.0s)]
*  Um, that's the only thing i've heard between between you and howard that he disagree with it's [[02:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7309.0s)]
*  990 times out of a thousand on a death case the decision was already made [[02:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7313.38s)]
*  So why did we just go through all this and i'll tell you another thing i take issue with [[02:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7318.2s)]
*  What's with the acknowledgement of there are many other houses in the area the guy's pleading guilty [[02:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7322.04s)]
*  We know he was there to go. I know king's road [[02:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7327.4s)]
*  Like it's clear why he's doing that. He's trying to imply. Well, maybe I couldn't have won this case [[02:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7330.84s)]
*  I don't don't attack me because maybe my case wasn't that solid he is going overboard to impugn his own case [[02:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7337.0s)]
*  Publicly, so he won't be criticized. Well, let me tell you another thing. Yeah, another thing and I look when he says [[02:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7343.9400000000005s)]
*  There was no component. I wrote this down no sexual component or um sexual assault. He doesn't know that [[02:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7351.24s)]
*  How do we know what brian koperger's intent was which is exactly you're just talking about megan. What do we [[02:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7358.12s)]
*  Why did he enter that house and he was obsessed with ted bundy [[02:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7363.88s)]
*  We know about that from some of the information actually, I think I read about that from something that that howard wrote [[02:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7367.08s)]
*  We know that he was obsessed with ted bundy ted bundy sexually abused every single one of his victims [[02:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7372.28s)]
*  So like mike tyson says everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face, right? [[02:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7377.32s)]
*  The great philosopher mike tyson. We don't know what brian koperger was thinking but I can tell you this the vast majority of of [[02:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7381.48s)]
*  Serial killers and I prosecuted 13 of these guys i'm about to write a second book on serial killers [[02:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7388.679999999999s)]
*  The vast majority of them, um back in the 1880s. They were dubbed sadistic lust murderers [[02:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7395.16s)]
*  That's what they used to he doesn't know this guy with his beard. Sorry [[02:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7401.0s)]
*  Does not know what brian koperger was thinking when he went in there [[02:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7405.4s)]
*  And he cannot say there was not a sexual component to it and i'll tell you what on behalf of sexual abuse victims everywhere [[02:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7409.8s)]
*  These victims can't speak for themselves [[02:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7417.08s)]
*  That was a slap in the face to people that have survived horrific things like this. He doesn't know [[02:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7419.24s)]
*  So he maybe he meant to say there was no actual sexual assault, which is fine [[02:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7424.759999999999s)]
*  But he spoke to his intent and that I think was inappropriate [[02:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7430.04s)]
*  Also was incorrect. I mean you cannot go into a house target a young woman [[02:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7433.799999999999s)]
*  and [[02:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7440.12s)]
*  Without having a sexual element in some way being part of the motivation and the thing is we'll never know his real motivation [[02:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7441.0s)]
*  all these things that the [[02:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7448.36s)]
*  Thompson said [[02:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7450.68s)]
*  He admitted for whatever reason evidence suggests. We'll never get those answers also interesting [[02:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7452.28s)]
*  This is a you know, a major victory really for ann taylor. She accomplished what she could with the cards. She was dealt [[02:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7457.56s)]
*  She kept her client from going before a firing squad [[02:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7463.72s)]
*  And yet the only time there was I thought a moment of perhaps a disagreement [[02:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7468.36s)]
*  When the judge asked her did you get all the discovery you needed and that's been a key [[02:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7473.4s)]
*  Part for her. She's been protesting that time after time. She filed two separate motions [[02:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7479.08s)]
*  About not getting the discovery she needed and yet here she paused, you know [[02:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7484.12s)]
*  Pregnantly and then she conceded yes just to appease the judge. I think [[02:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7488.1s)]
*  Yeah, can I add something else megan? [[02:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7493.64s)]
*  You know just having [[02:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7495.96s)]
*  Having done so many of these [[02:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7497.96s)]
*  When you listen to that judge [[02:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7500.4400000000005s)]
*  That's a no-nonsense judge. I know howard's got some criticism for him as a practicing lawyer [[02:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7502.92s)]
*  I don't I don't I can't offer any from what I just saw but [[02:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7507.8s)]
*  Look that judge would have taken care of business. He would have made the right rulings. He was sober as a as a [[02:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7511.4800000000005s)]
*  A trial lawyer [[02:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7518.6s)]
*  That's the type of person that when you got the evidence when you have a a judicial officer like that who is smart and on the ball [[02:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7519.8s)]
*  Like I think this judge very much is [[02:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7526.6s)]
*  um [[02:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7529.240000000001s)]
*  That's the courtroom where you win your cases. So again what has changed? I mean you got a you got a solid judge [[02:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7530.52s)]
*  You have overwhelming evidence. Um, it i've heard nothing whatsoever in mitigation offered at any point by the defense [[02:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7536.52s)]
*  um, this is a really good death penalty case and they're they all get appealed and [[02:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7544.200000000001s)]
*  You know, you're you're going to face the highest level of appellate scrutiny through the ninth circuit [[02:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7551.72s)]
*  Um as death penalty cases should but again the decision was made the family's geared up for it [[02:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7556.2s)]
*  I want to know what changed other than him coming to the table and wanting to take a deal which they always do [[02:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7562.52s)]
*  Let me just add this this other piece of it because you mentioned this [[02:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7568.52s)]
*  Did he have sexual motive in mind or was there any as cell as sexual element to this? [[02:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7572.12s)]
*  To to back up what you said you remember this came out in that dateline special that [[02:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7576.84s)]
*  Happened like a month ago that led ann taylor to say we need a delay of the trial date [[02:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7582.04s)]
*  This thing is so damning to us and clearly somebody on team prosecution or cop [[02:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7585.64s)]
*  participated or so it would seem because the a lot of the evidence we heard the prosecutor talking about there we learned from that [[02:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7590.900000000001s)]
*  Dateline special and one of the things was that in november 2022 after I believe was after the murders [[02:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7595.4800000000005s)]
*  brian kohlberger searched the internet for information about ted bundy and made a number of searches for pornography with the keywords [[02:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7603.0s)]
*  drugged [[02:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7611.08s)]
*  Sleeping and passed out now you tell me why he insisted on going in there at four in the morning [[02:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7612.1s)]
*  When three out of his four victims had been asleep were asleep. Ethan was asleep [[02:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7619.64s)]
*  Zana was up and she got chased but maddie and kaylee were asleep in their beds and he's searching for porn [[02:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7624.6s)]
*  Relating to sleeping victims matt and this prosecutor can say there was no sexual [[02:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7632.900000000001s)]
*  He doesn't know what brian kohlberger did he didn't he doesn't know whether he got off [[02:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7638.6s)]
*  As he's murdering those two girls or what element it brought up for him like how dare he say that? [[02:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7642.84s)]
*  That's right. Yeah, that's right. Totally inappropriate for him to do that [[02:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7649.320000000001s)]
*  I don't know if he misspoke and just meant to say sexual sexual assault because of course that doesn't [[02:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7653.160000000001s)]
*  Doesn't appear to have happened. But for him to say there's no sexual component. That's that offends me [[02:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7659.160000000001s)]
*  I don't think he misspoke. I think he said deliberately because he wants to put his plea deal in the best light [[02:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7664.679999999999s)]
*  I also think it's interesting to look at ann taylor and her team [[02:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7670.679999999999s)]
*  She filed many motions [[02:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7675.48s)]
*  Uh saying that kohlberger because where he was on the autistic spectrum wasn't able to understand things [[02:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7677.48s)]
*  He couldn't cooperate with his lawyers. He couldn't [[02:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7683.48s)]
*  Understand what was happening in the courtroom. He couldn't actually even make a plea now all of a sudden [[02:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7687.16s)]
*  She is allowing him to make this plea. He's saying under oath that he understands everything [[02:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7692.28s)]
*  and [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7699.08s)]
*  I know lawyers have a responsibility to defend their clients to the [[02:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7699.8s)]
*  Whoever they are to the best of their abilities, but things were said in defense of kohlberger by ann [[02:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7704.12s)]
*  Her team, uh, miss miss sooth miss miss sooth put her arm around kohlberger and said it is an honor an honor to [[02:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7711.16s)]
*  defend him [[02:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7718.92s)]
*  Uh, these things I think need to be answered [[02:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7720.36s)]
*  Yeah, there's uh [[02:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7725.24s)]
*  You know i'm a little more [[02:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7726.92s)]
*  Here it is. Here it is. Just just to reiterate. This is the full quote from the prosecutor [[02:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7728.599999999999s)]
*  I will say for the record that there is no evidence there was any sexual component or sexual assault [[02:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7733.32s)]
*  On any of the victims. I want to make that clear. So there's no speculation [[02:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7739.799999999999s)]
*  There it is [[02:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7744.679999999999s)]
*  Clear as day there is no sexual there was no sexual component [[02:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7745.96s)]
*  That he is out of line. How can he possibly know in in light of those searches which by the way he didn't mention [[02:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7751.64s)]
*  He also didn't mention those searches when when going back over his evidence. I'm sure that was no accident matt [[02:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7758.76s)]
*  Which are 100% admissible megan they would be they would be admissible in court for [[02:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7764.84s)]
*  Formative even if it's an uncharged [[02:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7770.5199999999995s)]
*  Act that that's coming in any judge is letting that out. I guarantee that particular judge would let that into evidence [[02:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7773.4s)]
*  So yeah, that's um, I think can I say one other thing about the judge? [[02:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7778.44s)]
*  Let me just say one other thing about judge. I I see your point [[02:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7782.68s)]
*  I take your point was winnable because the judge has no nonsense [[02:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7785.0s)]
*  But I will say shame on that judge for not understanding how to pronounce zana cronodal's name by this point in the proceedings [[02:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7787.32s)]
*  It was disrespectful and I can understand once you're nervous the cameras are on but it happened repeatedly [[02:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7794.04s)]
*  And i'm sure it it had like the shock effect on anyone who knew zana including her family like i'm sorry [[02:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7800.2s)]
*  But study the names before you walk in there as the judge. I thought it was disrespectful and howard [[02:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7807.16s)]
*  I also thought it was disrespectful for him to open it up [[02:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7811.96s)]
*  By chastising steve gonsalves, which is really what he did with his whole [[02:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7816.2s)]
*  Someone is telling people to call the court. That was steve in a desperate father whose daughter is murdered [[02:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7821.16s)]
*  Said please maybe if we call the courthouse we can stop this from getting approved and instead of being like [[02:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7828.44s)]
*  You know gentle about it. Please don't call the court because it's not going to change anything with respect to the families [[02:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7836.36s)]
*  We understand this is agonizing instead. He was angry [[02:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7841.88s)]
*  And his ire was toward the dad of one of the four victims [[02:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7845.72s)]
*  I mean steve is a tragic figure in this whole case early on he made a statement [[02:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7849.64s)]
*  I was there he said you send your daughter off to college and she comes back to you in a box [[02:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7856.2s)]
*  I mean that's heartbreaking and after [[02:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7861.879999999999s)]
*  Living through something like that everything that he does [[02:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7865.08s)]
*  however [[02:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7868.919999999999s)]
*  Seems out of bounds out of normal rules of conduct of decorum. Well, you have to cut him some slack [[02:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7870.28s)]
*  You have to understand it. He's become [[02:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7876.36s)]
*  To my mind and I wrote about him a great deal in my book and elsewhere an almost captain ahab figure who's you know [[02:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7880.04s)]
*  Refuses to surrender who's going on wherever it is who's doing his own investigation [[02:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7886.66s)]
*  Who's trying to connect the dots any way he can if he thinks I did something wrong? [[02:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7891.32s)]
*  He's on my case. I understand that if he thinks the police did something wrong. He's on their case, too [[02:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7896.04s)]
*  I mean in many ways [[02:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7901.64s)]
*  He's a hero and yet he's also [[02:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7903.72s)]
*  Will be a victim forever of this case all those families that's the real tragedy are there are no survivors. They're only victims [[02:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7906.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah, I do want to give credit. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead. I'm sorry [[02:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7914.52s)]
*  Yeah, um, you know one thing to keep in mind here that I do want to say that I think the judge did do right [[02:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7918.280000000001s)]
*  Is by continuing the sentencing hearing itself [[02:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7923.8s)]
*  Under idaho law the court does not have to give the victims an opportunity to address the court [[02:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7927.320000000001s)]
*  Okay, so that's one thing that the judge didn't have to do that he did do that is incredibly important for victims families [[02:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7932.92s)]
*  including hopefully on that day mr. Gonzales himself because he'll be able to [[02:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7939.16s)]
*  Express that with brian cobriger sitting in the room and under they have a crime victims bill of rights that passed in 1994 [[02:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7943.8s)]
*  But it is discretionary with the court [[02:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7951.64s)]
*  So I do want to say kudos to the court for allowing the family to do that [[02:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7953.400000000001s)]
*  I think that was very appropriate [[02:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7957.16s)]
*  And what he could have done i'm gonna say could have he could have imposed the sentence today [[02:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7959.08s)]
*  And so by by putting that off [[02:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7963.64s)]
*  I do want to give him credit on that one point because that is one of those things even though everybody is going to know [[02:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7965.48s)]
*  What the sentence is going to be and I can tell you right now. He's not reducing any of these any of these counts [[02:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7971.32s)]
*  Um, but when family members address the court i've sat through a lot of those they they are incredibly impactful [[02:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7976.28s)]
*  And it does give them something at least they get their moment in court where the defendant has to listen to them to [[02:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7982.92s)]
*  Talk about their grief. So I you know, we heard that the judge say was going to be july 22nd [[02:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7989.08s)]
*  It's been moved to july 23rd. It's now going to be july 23rd [[02:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7994.84s)]
*  Um, I will say this, you know, steve gonzales was out there [[02:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=7998.84s)]
*  Begging for the court to listen to him because he was very upset about how this went down [[02:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8003.96s)]
*  And he was very upset that he did learn about the fact that there was a plea deal [[02:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8008.84s)]
*  Via email we talked about this a bit yesterday matt via email [[02:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8013.88s)]
*  And I just want you to remember that the audience to remember that as we look back at this prosecutor [[02:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8017.88s)]
*  I'm just gonna say it. I think working up tears in that one moment [[02:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8022.92s)]
*  I think he I think it was an affectation meant by him to show I i'm connected to this case [[02:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8027.56s)]
*  It's been very hard on me. I'm a feeling person [[02:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8033.96s)]
*  Don't believe that I I disregarded anybody's wishes and striking this deal because I really think we wouldn't be seeing [[02:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8037.160000000001s)]
*  A notification by email to the families that the guy's not going to be put to death and there's not going to be a trial [[02:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8044.28s)]
*  If he deeply cared as he clearly wants us to believe in this sound it might be tears of relief that he can move on [[02:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8052.04s)]
*  He's finally done [[02:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8057.88s)]
*  If that is true, no, wait, watch watch stand by [[02:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8059.88s)]
*  So your honor at the end [[02:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8063.96s)]
*  Uh the state submits the evidence that i've given just a quick overview of [[02:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8065.96s)]
*  Of [[02:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8069.96s)]
*  And that presenting court would consume weeks which the state is prepared to do and has been prepared to do [[02:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8071.4800000000005s)]
*  Would show that as the defendant has just admitted and pleaded guilty on november 13th 2022 [[02:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8077.72s)]
*  Excuse me [[02:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8084.92s)]
*  Mr. Coburger entered the residence of 1122 king road in mosco, idaho. He did that with the intent to kill [[02:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8089.320000000001s)]
*  The man who was killed on the night of the murder of the defendant [[02:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8096.2s)]
*  Is the man who was killed on the night of the murder of the defendant [[02:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8099.8s)]
*  And that is what he did [[02:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8103.88s)]
*  And that is what he did [[02:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8106.28s)]
*  So we will not represent that he intended to commit all of the murders that he did that night, but we know [[02:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8109.0s)]
*  That that is what resulted [[02:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8115.16s)]
*  and that he then killed [[02:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8117.64s)]
*  intentionally willfully to deliberately with premeditation and with malice for thought [[02:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8120.2s)]
*  and [[02:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8126.12s)]
*  Well, he's a very good performer [[02:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8127.32s)]
*  And this was his opportunity to have his final say and then move on [[02:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8130.44s)]
*  I think I think it was a very contrived moment. I think he was milking it for all it was worth and [[02:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8135.8s)]
*  You know, he can also be very tough during one of the motions filings. He got a [[02:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8142.36s)]
*  The defense witness to cry on the stand when he was he was coming at him so hard [[02:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8148.6s)]
*  Uh bill thompson can be a very tough guy and I I think this was a moment to show that even though he's making this deal [[02:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8154.4400000000005s)]
*  He cares [[02:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8161.400000000001s)]
*  Uh, I think that's why it seemed it seemed it seemed orchestrated to me [[02:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8162.4400000000005s)]
*  I have to be honest [[02:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8166.28s)]
*  It seemed like the timing of it how it came just right at the last moment while he was closing [[02:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8167.0s)]
*  He's the lehto county prosecutor bill thompson. I don't know matt. Do you want to say something on it? [[02:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8171.64s)]
*  Well, look [[02:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8177.08s)]
*  when men cry in court it is [[02:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8178.36s)]
*  Among professional prosecutors it's that's a trope we we make fun of we make fun of people for doing that. It's not professional [[02:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8181.32s)]
*  Um, it's it it comes off whether it's legitimate or not in this case. It comes off as totally [[02:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8188.2s)]
*  performative and it it it also if [[02:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8193.94s)]
*  If that's right if steve gonzalez and I think he's been accurate. Um, obviously he's very angry [[02:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8197.88s)]
*  But if if that's true that they were notified in an email [[02:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8203.56s)]
*  You don't get to cry in court when you talk about their daughter. I'm sorry [[02:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8207.48s)]
*  I mean I gotta call him out on that. It's it's unprofessional [[02:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8211.4s)]
*  There are prosecutors all across the country right now. If you just watch that who ruled their eyes [[02:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8214.36s)]
*  I guarantee and defense lawyers, too [[02:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8219.24s)]
*  um that was uh [[02:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8221.4s)]
*  It it the the case is certainly tragic. It's not not even tragic tragedy is the wrong word [[02:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8223.48s)]
*  Murder is not tragedy is what happens when somebody gets hit by a bus. Okay murder is different murder is intended. So [[02:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8229.08s)]
*  It is as awful as it is you can cry behind closed doors that you're going through the evidence [[02:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8236.439999999999s)]
*  But to cry publicly when steve gonzalez refuses to go inside [[02:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8241.72s)]
*  I I just I think people should have a problem with that and this guy look he he said he was going for death [[02:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8245.64s)]
*  Nothing appears to have changed and it looks like they blanked he had all the evidence in the world [[02:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8251.56s)]
*  But I do want to say this [[02:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8256.439999999999s)]
*  Um, it is horrible for the families when death penalty cases come back [[02:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8257.8s)]
*  I had to try cases that came back my rodney alcohola case. I I did the third trial of that. It's brutal on the families [[02:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8261.48s)]
*  But that's why you you you put on a good case and you you keep it streamlined and you do it right [[02:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8268.76s)]
*  And you remove those issues on appeal and that's I can't help but think of that [[02:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8275.24s)]
*  You know in politics the democrats have been trying to trying out that taco thing [[02:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8278.92s)]
*  This is before trump dropped bombs on iran trump always chickens out thompson always chickens out. He's a taco this guy thompson [[02:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8283.0s)]
*  He he chickened out. That's how it seems to me [[02:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8289.8s)]
*  It it it's for once I agree with politics with you megan [[02:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8292.519999999999s)]
*  Everything goes back to politics in my life [[02:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8296.519999999999s)]
*  But how I wanted to ask you when you watch when you watch kohlberger because you I mean you've written books about this guy now [[02:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8298.439999999999s)]
*  You you've gone deep into his writings when he was a teenager [[02:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8303.0s)]
*  Was it what did you make of his snappy little? I know the answer. Yes. Yes [[02:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8306.84s)]
*  Yes, I did. I killed that human being and that one [[02:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8311.96s)]
*  He was in in control he was the best student [[02:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8315.56s)]
*  His legal team you could see they they showed some emotion a little bit in their faces [[02:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8319.4s)]
*  He had a haircut. He didn't wear a suit jacket. He looked like he'd been working out his arms looked [[02:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8325.16s)]
*  He did pumped a little bit [[02:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8330.76s)]
*  You know it made you think that [[02:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8334.68s)]
*  You know five, you know five terms in prison four terms in prison rather is not going to be so hard for him [[02:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8337.64s)]
*  Is not going to be so hard for him. It's a travesty. It really is. I meant to I meant to mention that to the audience [[02:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8342.76s)]
*  He was sitting there. He was clean cut. He didn't have any sort of facial hair [[02:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8348.52s)]
*  His hair looked like it had been recently cut. It was closely cropped on the sides [[02:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8351.24s)]
*  It looked a little lighter than I saw when he was first arrested and we saw him in the jumpsuit [[02:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8355.0s)]
*  It looked like a lighter brown as opposed to um, like the darker brown at least from the feed. I was watching [[02:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8359.24s)]
*  He was wearing a white button down for the listening audience [[02:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8365.56s)]
*  He's wearing a white button down like a man a man's work shirt that you'd wear to you know, wall street and a [[02:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8368.28s)]
*  blue gray tie, but no jacket, which is interesting and [[02:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8374.28s)]
*  He had one piece of paper in front of him and one pen. He was next to ann taylor and another female attorney [[02:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8378.52s)]
*  He had broad shoulders. He looked fit. He used to be morbidly obese [[02:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8384.76s)]
*  And then got super into veganism and health and went on this tear after his heroin addiction [[02:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8389.480000000001s)]
*  And got super thin which you know became a new sort of religion in his life from what we read [[02:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8396.92s)]
*  Um, I want to bring do we have phil now phil holloway's joining us. He's also here. No, he's not [[02:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8402.28s)]
*  Okay, he's going to be here in a minute. So he'll join us with his thoughts on on everything. Um, yeah [[02:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8406.84s)]
*  If I could just add to what you were saying, i'm sorry. Yeah, go go ahead. Yeah [[02:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8411.640000000001s)]
*  No [[02:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8415.480000000001s)]
*  From a tactical perspective you look at that and when you're when you get into the penalty phase and the defense starts calling experts [[02:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8416.28s)]
*  Talk about his autism or where he is on the spectrum and it was not functional what we saw as a guy [[02:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8422.2s)]
*  Who was sharp who understood the rules? [[02:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8427.400000000001s)]
*  He was attentive. He has all of that cuts the prosecution way in the penalty phase [[02:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8429.560000000001s)]
*  So that that actually in my eyes was very telling on on the likelihood of this of the defense prevailing [[02:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8435.880000000001s)]
*  On any of those like mental health issues or any any of that sort of thing? [[02:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8442.52s)]
*  Brian kohlberger was he was lucid. He understood everything that was going on and that is exactly why once again [[02:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8446.84s)]
*  This is a death penalty case at the very beginning and it should still be a death penalty case now [[02:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8453.640000000001s)]
*  And how are you you you had some information motions? [[02:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8458.2s)]
*  Yeah, but you had information yesterday that you sent me I read it to the audience [[02:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8461.240000000002s)]
*  Speculation about what may have led him to plead regarding his parents [[02:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8464.76s)]
*  And let me just give you this bit of information from the courtroom about kohlberger's parents and then you can fill things in howard [[02:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8468.68s)]
*  Brian enton of news nations reporting as follows brian kohlberger's parents are not crying [[02:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8475.48s)]
*  But they do they look sad unlike their son who looks stone cold [[02:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8481.4s)]
*  He admitted it all i'm sitting behind his parents. So the parents were there today [[02:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8486.28s)]
*  Maybe not his sisters from the sound of it. I'm not sure but his parents were there [[02:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8491.0s)]
*  And that leads me back to steve gonzalves because outside the courthouse this morning. He had a couple of [[02:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8496.2s)]
*  of odd [[02:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8503.24s)]
*  Comments, I mean not well odd in that. I didn't fully understand them about asking their news media to go check out when [[02:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8505.48s)]
*  Brian kohlberger's father bought his plane tickets to come out. Do we have that sound bite you guys we can play it [[02:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8513.8s)]
*  Uh standby here it is [[02:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8520.6s)]
*  Yeah, what do you want we know we know when you flew out here we know we know [[02:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8525.8s)]
*  We have your flight records [[02:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8530.68s)]
*  I'm not gonna see when when you say, you know the flight records. What do you mean steve? I know when his parents booked their flight [[02:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8534.84s)]
*  When his father did [[02:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8542.04s)]
*  What does that mean? [[02:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8544.04s)]
*  You you you'll find out would you like to say something to them? [[02:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8546.28s)]
*  The rest of your family went inside is it important for them to be in there today? [[02:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8555.08s)]
*  Yeah, for sure [[02:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8559.32s)]
*  Where are you going? Are you not able to get it? [[02:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8560.76s)]
*  You're not staying in [[02:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8564.92s)]
*  First of all, it's remarkable because he's usually very composed and you can see today was tough for him [[02:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8569.56s)]
*  But what do you make of kohlberger's family? [[02:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8574.12s)]
*  Their presence there and what if any role they had in his reversal because all along the word had been he's not [[02:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8577.48s)]
*  Taking a plea he wants to go to trial [[02:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8584.76s)]
*  What I discovered in the course of my reporting that [[02:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8588.52s)]
*  Early on ann taylor had a sense that this is a case that they could [[02:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8591.48s)]
*  She would like to get a plea deal [[02:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8595.96s)]
*  She approached kohlberger and discussed it with him [[02:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8598.52s)]
*  This is before there was the alternate perpetrator ruling that was ruled out and he said no [[02:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8602.6s)]
*  Because his mother was insisting that she she did not want her son [[02:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8608.76s)]
*  To admit to guilt to these crimes [[02:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8612.84s)]
*  Maybe she didn't believe he was guilty or whatever then it seems and this is what i've been told [[02:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8615.48s)]
*  This is what has been suggested to me that on [[02:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8621.16s)]
*  It's a matter of record that on after the murders [[02:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8624.52s)]
*  On 6 a.m [[02:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8627.8s)]
*  He called for an hour at the parents home in pennsylvania at 6 a.m [[02:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8629.24s)]
*  He spoke with his mother not his father [[02:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8634.84s)]
*  it was [[02:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8638.36s)]
*  Suggested that the now the state was now going to call the mother to the stand and want to find out what was said [[02:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8639.48s)]
*  During that phone call that caused kohlberger [[02:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8645.88s)]
*  As it was reported to me a great deal of distress. He did not want this to become public [[02:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8649.5s)]
*  He also did not want it was brought up to him that his father would have to testify perhaps on the stand [[02:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8654.380000000001s)]
*  About what was said during their cross-country trip that I write about in great detail in my book and in the airmail articles [[02:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8660.060000000001s)]
*  He wanted that to be kept secret, too [[02:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8667.820000000002s)]
*  so part of the reason [[02:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8670.7s)]
*  I've been told that he finally agreed to [[02:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8672.380000000001s)]
*  Okay to tell his team try to see if we can get a plea deal was that he wanted to keep his parents from testifying [[02:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8674.779999999999s)]
*  He didn't want them to be put in a situation that might leave them in some sort of jeopardy might impugn their reputations in the community [[02:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8680.46s)]
*  He was trying to protect them that led well. Well, that's that's interesting [[02:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8688.38s)]
*  what you just said because I [[02:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8693.98s)]
*  I struggled with this yesterday asking how can a sociopath who takes the eye the life so easily of for innocence [[02:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8695.9s)]
*  Then have empathy for his parents like well gee, I don't want that but maybe it's not empathy [[02:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8702.779999999999s)]
*  It's that I don't want them to be in the position of like going to jail [[02:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8706.779999999999s)]
*  I'm human being enough to say I don't want them becoming like the parents of [[02:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8711.42s)]
*  um that guy down in florida brian landry, uh, [[02:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8716.3s)]
*  Who killed gabby pitito and it was very clear the parents knew what their son had done [[02:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8719.98s)]
*  They denied it but they they've become the scourges of the nation because it was very clear that they let gabby pitito's parents suffer [[02:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8725.179999999998s)]
*  While they knew their son had done something terrible. These are the only anchors he has for the rest of his life [[02:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8732.619999999999s)]
*  In jail, he wants to protect them [[02:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8739.179999999998s)]
*  He if he couldn't get out of this quickly everyone wants to just get this over with and move on [[02:25:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8741.66s)]
*  And that's why I also find so distressing that the judge allowed this gag order to stay in place [[02:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8746.46s)]
*  So after everything is done, uh, so everything that you reporters might find out, uh, [[02:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8751.42s)]
*  Become ancient history by the time it gets out there [[02:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8757.9s)]
*  Well, I mean they haven't been able to stop you howard it's been incredible the scoops you've gotten that we've then watched [[02:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8761.18s)]
*  Come alive as the case went on scoop after scoop would be verified [[02:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8766.220000000001s)]
*  Later as the I think in some of the cases law enforcement got more bold about releasing some of their things [[02:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8771.660000000002s)]
*  And let me just ask you to follow up on that howard on that dateline special that had so many previously unknown details [[02:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8777.34s)]
*  Do you think that was law enforcement cooperating with dateline? Do you think there was some? [[02:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8783.26s)]
*  Disgruntled cop who was like this thing's not going the way I want it to go and I got to make sure this stuff gets out there [[02:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8787.18s)]
*  I'm I you know participated in that, uh special you were in it. So, uh, uh, and uh, I [[02:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8794.54s)]
*  I really don't want to comment on it and say about any of the sourcing on it. I think it would be unfair to [[02:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8801.66s)]
*  My involvement in there, but just the producers did a tremendous job. Uh, they really broke this case open [[02:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8809.26s)]
*  That's interesting. I'm gonna text you offline and then and then i'll get back to my audience in a way that's reportable [[02:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8817.5s)]
*  Okay, phil holloway joins us now. He just beamed in [[02:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8822.380000000001s)]
*  We were on the air together not long ago talking about the diddy trial and I have to say phil [[02:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8826.62s)]
*  You know like what a bad day for justice. This is what a bad day [[02:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8831.1s)]
*  You know diddy gets off on the main charges against him and brian kohlberger didn't get away with murder [[02:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8834.86s)]
*  But his life is spared and he doesn't deserve it your thoughts [[02:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8840.220000000001s)]
*  You know, i'm joining this conversation with your other guests a little late and i'm not sure what their position may be on this but look [[02:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8843.66s)]
*  Uh, as I said as we were heading out of our earlier [[02:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8851.26s)]
*  Uh diddy discussion in the last minute or so of that. I think this was a a travesty. I think that they had a [[02:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8855.58s)]
*  They had a closed open and closed case against kohlberger. I think it was [[02:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8862.7s)]
*  um an obvious conviction and after hearing this [[02:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8867.58s)]
*  Um presentation today and the change of plea hearing i'm even more [[02:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8871.5s)]
*  settled in that conviction they [[02:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8876.78s)]
*  The only real reason that I can think of when I was a prosecutor, you know, we always were told that [[02:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8879.18s)]
*  Victims get a say in these things now [[02:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8885.900000000001s)]
*  They don't get to drive the train and I understand that maybe some of the victims families may have supported this but [[02:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8887.82s)]
*  You needed more [[02:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8894.94s)]
*  unanimous agreement we the [[02:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8896.68s)]
*  The victims families needed to know the why of all this I think to get enough closure [[02:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8899.0s)]
*  Now i'm sure there's reasonable arguments on the other side of that as well [[02:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8905.08s)]
*  You know it they don't have to live through the appeals process and and thinking about this for the next several decades [[02:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8908.68s)]
*  All those are valid points [[02:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8914.6s)]
*  But if you have the victims that are not immensely on board [[02:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8916.76s)]
*  Then I don't see how uh, they can go forward with a prosecution [[02:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8921.56s)]
*  Um that does not include the death penalty [[02:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8926.859999999999s)]
*  Can can you matt can you go to the to the defendant who's come to you saying please make an offer and say [[02:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8929.82s)]
*  I'll consider i'll consider life without parole if [[02:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8937.5s)]
*  We get a full allocution from you [[02:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8941.66s)]
*  We want to know the details that the families will not sign off on it [[02:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8944.14s)]
*  And i'm just not going to do this without their blessing unless they have questions answered and that's what we need. Can you do that? [[02:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8947.5s)]
*  100 you can do that [[02:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8954.619999999999s)]
*  100 that's available and the only thing is to keep in mind here megan [[02:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8956.619999999999s)]
*  It's not life without possibility of parole [[02:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8960.619999999999s)]
*  It is 50 to life is what we're talking about consecutive sentences of burglary plus the four murders [[02:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8962.859999999999s)]
*  And that's 50 to life right now mandatory minimum until like you observed yesterday when we were talking about this until they change the law in idaha [[02:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8968.46s)]
*  Hopefully they don't but in california where I am our legislature [[02:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8975.74s)]
*  Changes the law to the benefit of defendants all the time and 50 years is an awful long time for that law to change [[02:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8979.82s)]
*  And especially when it comes to [[02:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8986.06s)]
*  Yeah, this but this is a 10-year mandatory minimum so that's 10 years to life essentially for each one in idaho [[02:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8990.54s)]
*  Stacking them consecutively means this is a determinant sentence [[02:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=8997.98s)]
*  I believe at sentencing day unless there's some provision in idaho law i'm not aware of he's looking at 50 to life [[02:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9001.58s)]
*  Which means if he survives long enough he would have an opportunity for a parole hearing [[02:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9006.78s)]
*  That's something that that hasn't been discussed yet, but that's that's my reading of what I heard [[02:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9011.58s)]
*  But how can that be because they said they'll run consecutively meaning one after the other so it'd be [[02:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9016.140000000001s)]
*  50 years potentially on on each [[02:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9022.060000000001s)]
*  Murder victim plus another 10 on the burglary. No, so that would be 10 years. It's a 10-year minimum [[02:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9024.86s)]
*  Stacked up it's a 10-year minimum for each murder. So like in california for a second-degree murder [[02:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9031.66s)]
*  How are you shaking your head? Did I did I know my mouth? No, no, it's right [[02:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9037.1s)]
*  It's just i'm shaking my head in [[02:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9040.460000000001s)]
*  Disgust and then yeah, you know we talk about politics being the art of the deal [[02:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9042.78s)]
*  Well, this was thompson's chance to make the deal. He had all the cards and he just blew it [[02:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9047.5s)]
*  And by the way philip just so you know, um everything you said I agree with [[02:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9053.18s)]
*  You basically have got everything I said to as another former prosecutor [[02:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9057.26s)]
*  Yeah, so you're telling me matt just back to your main point [[02:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9061.1s)]
*  There actually is a chance under this deal that he could see the light of day again [[02:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9065.02s)]
*  I think there's a there's a there's a good chance. He'll get a parole hearing whether hopefully he's never given an opportunity and [[02:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9069.02s)]
*  And the parole boards in idaho remain steady, you know, but california. We've seen a huge shift to the left [[02:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9076.140000000001s)]
*  um, and to to people getting out and the legislator is the legislator [[02:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9083.1s)]
*  Legislature has passed multiple laws that make it easier and easier for lifers to get out life used to mean life in california [[02:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9088.22s)]
*  And over the last 15 years it is tacked very dramatically the opposite way [[02:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9095.42s)]
*  So who knows what's going to happen in idaho, but that's the thing elwop is not his sentence [[02:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9100.06s)]
*  He will get he will have a mandatory minimum time [[02:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9105.42s)]
*  I believe based on this math of 50 and it might even be less than that if burglary is less [[02:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9108.7s)]
*  He's gonna he's agreeing to the 10, but you know as i'm writing down the math and my math is usually wrong, but [[02:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9114.22s)]
*  Um, that's this is going to be I believe a 50 year to life sentence where he will do a mandatory minimum [[02:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9121.02s)]
*  um of 50 [[02:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9127.1s)]
*  Less the burg potentially but he's going to be eligible for a parole hearing based on what I heard today in court [[02:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9129.18s)]
*  Wow, he's only 30 years old. He's still a young man. You know, he gets to [[02:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9134.539999999999s)]
*  Make friends in in jail. He gets to [[02:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9139.58s)]
*  Talk to his family. He gets to see people on video calls. He gets to write letters. He gets to read books [[02:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9143.099999999999s)]
*  He gets to do all the things [[02:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9149.66s)]
*  that [[02:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9151.98s)]
*  uh [[02:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9152.779999999999s)]
*  The these victims can't do I mean [[02:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9153.9s)]
*  Maybe he's in jail, but he gets to he gets to make something of a life himself life for himself [[02:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9156.779999999999s)]
*  Even if it's in prison, they don't get that he deserves to spend the next several decades [[02:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9163.26s)]
*  Uh, not just uh working out the the arts and crafts and the whatever kind of things [[02:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9169.82s)]
*  He's going to get lined up for in prison [[02:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9174.78s)]
*  He needs to spend the next several decades worrying about that firing squad. Is he going to her needle? [[02:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9176.94s)]
*  Are they going to aim right? Is it going to be quick or am I going to feel the firing squad? [[02:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9183.34s)]
*  That's the punishment. That's what he needs to be thinking about over the next 50 or so years [[02:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9189.1s)]
*  Not whether or not he gets to make his skype calls every day [[02:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9195.02s)]
*  I think families need to [[02:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9199.5s)]
*  To have answers they they can't be left with for whatever reason or the evidence suggests [[02:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9202.06s)]
*  Yeah, and the taxpayers at idaho who funded this whole thing for two and a half years [[02:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9207.26s)]
*  This needs to be taken to a conclusion to let's find out what happened [[02:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9211.5s)]
*  Go ahead. Let me add a phillips comment real quick megan [[02:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9217.1s)]
*  Yeah [[02:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9220.38s)]
*  When it comes to these types of deals one of the things you hear in the death penalty debate so often is [[02:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9221.42s)]
*  Well, it gives them a long time to sit in their cell and essentially think about what they did [[02:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9226.859999999999s)]
*  That again is humanizing the psychopath their brains don't work like that [[02:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9232.06s)]
*  They don't think like the rest of us they otherwise they wouldn't have committed the crime in the first place [[02:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9238.699999999999s)]
*  They don't sit in their cell regretting what they did. There's no such thing as regret in their mind. So [[02:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9243.34s)]
*  Philip is exactly right. So it really hit the nail on the head. He's [[02:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9248.619999999999s)]
*  Shock showing the audience the picture of him in the white shirt the morning after the murders with the thumbs up [[02:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9252.859999999999s)]
*  Looking like psycho in front of a shower. Keep going matt [[02:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9257.74s)]
*  Does that guy look like somebody that's going to sit in his cell and regret anything that he did? [[02:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9260.14s)]
*  I mean he he that guy probably still has some dna at the moment [[02:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9263.9s)]
*  He took that photo of the victims on his body as he's giving a thumbs up [[02:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9267.74s)]
*  So that's not somebody that is going to regret anything in jail and he looks like a vampire in that photo, by the way [[02:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9272.06s)]
*  I mean that's he does that is that guy is not going to jail [[02:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9277.419999999998s)]
*  He's not going to sit in state prison and regret one thing that he did [[02:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9281.18s)]
*  He's going to regret getting caught but he will adjust and just like just like phil just pointed out [[02:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9284.62s)]
*  He's going to program and he's going to do the classes and he's going to probably finish out his phd [[02:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9289.66s)]
*  And he's going to he's going to talk to other inmates and he has an opportunity to make friends [[02:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9294.78s)]
*  And sit in a child line and his family will get him a tv [[02:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9298.94s)]
*  And it's it is absolutely not the same thing as sitting on death row, especially someplace like idaho that really [[02:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9302.140000000001s)]
*  Might execute him unlike california and some other states that have death penalty on the books, but it's not actually carried out idaho [[02:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9309.18s)]
*  He would actually face [[02:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9315.900000000001s)]
*  Yeah, here's what kaylee gonsalves's 18 year old sister obri wrote in reaction to the the news of the deal [[02:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9317.900000000001s)]
*  Brian kohlberger facing a life in prison means he would still get to speak [[02:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9324.78s)]
*  Form relationships and engage with the world. Meanwhile, our loved ones have been silenced forever [[02:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9328.54s)]
*  That reality stings more deeply when it feels like the system is protecting his future more than honoring the victims pasts [[02:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9334.22s)]
*  So well said by an 18 year old and by the way again to the point of like the judge couldn't even pronounce zanna [[02:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9341.42s)]
*  Cronodal's name. It's like yes, it felt disrespectful. Where were the victims there today? [[02:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9347.02s)]
*  There wasn't really even a moment where we learned who they really were or anything about them [[02:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9351.58s)]
*  There was absolutely no attempt to humanize the victims today by the judge or the prosecutor for that matter [[02:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9357.5s)]
*  They were all but forgotten in there howard [[02:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9363.34s)]
*  Totally, I mean also to go back to the photograph we just showed of the thumbs up [[02:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9366.78s)]
*  That photograph was taken approximately 20 minutes after he got off off the hour phone call with his mother [[02:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9371.66s)]
*  Uh, so that's sort of the timeline. Do you think he confessed to the mother howard? [[02:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9378.380000000001s)]
*  Is that what you're intimating? It's a hypothesis. I think things were said to her that made her perhaps realize [[02:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9383.1s)]
*  Something's not right. I just the same way that on the drive across the country his father realized was beginning to realize [[02:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9390.3s)]
*  Could my son be this monster? I mean you're sitting shoulder to shoulder in a white honday [[02:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9399.18s)]
*  Every cop in the whole country is looking for a white honday elantra. You know, your son has some problems [[02:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9404.38s)]
*  You put two and two together, but and his sister too, right? [[02:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9410.06s)]
*  Yes, the sister was the one who really articulated at some point [[02:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9413.74s)]
*  She goes to the father and confronts him and he according to the reporting i've done [[02:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9417.74s)]
*  He walks off. He doesn't make any comment [[02:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9422.46s)]
*  But slowly they are following this trail of footprints and they realize where it's leading to them [[02:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9425.02s)]
*  And I think this phone call what happened on that phone call would have come up in the courtroom and it might have [[02:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9430.06s)]
*  Implicated them might have put them in perhaps legal jeopardy and that picture you're showing now [[02:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9437.08s)]
*  He looks like an army recruit with his shaved sort of sides and looking in good shape [[02:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9442.3s)]
*  Oh, he's definitely been working out. I mean, he's got like the broad shoulders now though [[02:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9447.98s)]
*  Which he didn't have before but the the there is one person who knew him almost as well as the family arguably [[02:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9451.02s)]
*  And that was his college professor his his master's degree professor this katherine ramsland [[02:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9457.5s)]
*  Who hasn't spoken at all? [[02:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9463.02s)]
*  She has given no interviews because she was expected to be called as a witness by the prosecution [[02:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9465.1s)]
*  But since the case has pled out she feels free to speak [[02:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9469.74s)]
*  And she gave an interview to news nations brian enton last night. It was fascinating [[02:37:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9473.98s)]
*  I'm going to show you guys a couple of uh pieces of it [[02:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9479.1s)]
*  I showed one at the top of our show today, but i'm going to get into the substance here [[02:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9481.26s)]
*  Okay, so he asked her all the right questions like this one like [[02:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9484.86s)]
*  Did you get the creepy vibe off of him is essentially what he's asking when when he was in your many classes? [[02:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9489.58s)]
*  And here's that in stop 43 [[02:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9495.58s)]
*  Was there anything looking back now that? [[02:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9497.98s)]
*  Was strange about him or that you that you noticed [[02:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9501.5s)]
*  When I look back there really isn't anything that stood out to me [[02:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9506.060000000001s)]
*  Um, I think when you're a teacher your your instinct is to accept students at face value. You don't [[02:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9510.060000000001s)]
*  You know start with suspicions or you know, there really weren't any red flags. He was always really quite respectful and [[02:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9517.42s)]
*  Uh grateful he would thank me for things he was attentive [[02:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9526.539999999999s)]
*  He would do the work [[02:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9531.42s)]
*  Um, I didn't have any concerns [[02:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9533.42s)]
*  I just want the audience and you guys to hear we worked on this special with howard in december 2023 [[02:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9537.02s)]
*  Where we for a week got into this case and we pulled and howard pulled brian kohlberger's old writings from his teenage years [[02:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9543.02s)]

*  There wasn't an inkling howard that she was dealing with her own serial killer [[02:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9703.1s)]
*  That's what she says what's also a matter of record is that several days after [[02:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9709.98s)]
*  A coburger was caught in pennsylvania. She calls up the family [[02:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9714.859999999999s)]

*  First first he asked what did you make of it when you heard that your star student who you recommended for this [[02:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9758.619999999999s)]

*  What did you think when you first heard that brian coburger? [[02:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9773.9s)]
*  Your former student was arrested for this [[02:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9777.98s)]
*  I was completely floored. I I didn't believe it [[02:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9782.86s)]
*  and [[02:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9787.5s)]
*  his [[02:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9788.779999999999s)]
*  demeanor [[02:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9790.06s)]
*  Um that we saw on you know on media was that he was confident that he was going to be able to prove his innocence [[02:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9791.26s)]
*  So I wanted to wait and see I wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt [[02:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9798.38s)]
*  Um, but as months go by and he kept saying that he had an alibi [[02:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9802.939999999999s)]
*  And I wondered well, why are you sitting in jail? [[02:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9808.699999999999s)]
*  Give us your alibi get out and that wasn't happening [[02:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9812.779999999999s)]
*  and then it was really when [[02:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9817.26s)]
*  He said his alibi and it was [[02:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9819.66s)]
*  Clearly not an alibi and he would have known that [[02:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9822.46s)]
*  certainly from all the classes that he had through [[02:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9825.58s)]
*  Undergraduate and graduate work you would have understood that wasn't really an alibi. I think that was when I was [[02:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9829.5s)]
*  really [[02:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9837.980000000001s)]
*  you know floored that [[02:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9839.1s)]
*  This is my student who has done these things [[02:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9842.300000000001s)]
*  That is so [[02:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9847.5s)]
*  Telling because we all watched this and he said he had an alibi [[02:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9848.7s)]
*  We all waited his lawyers like and his reporters where what's the alibi great lay it on us [[02:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9851.900000000001s)]
*  Let us test it and it came out that he was driving around at night stargazing [[02:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9857.34s)]
*  So even his mentor in the criminal justice field heard that and that's when she knew [[02:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9863.02s)]
*  He did it [[02:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9869.02s)]
*  That was remarkable. Anybody want to take that one on? [[02:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9870.380000000001s)]
*  Well at that moment and taylor must have realized in the back of her mind [[02:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9873.02s)]
*  My client is guilty and she has to be thinking how am I going to plea out of this? [[02:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9877.1s)]
*  How can I prevent him from going to a firing squad? [[02:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9881.42s)]
*  I think i'll give it to you in a second phil but and taylor by the way, you're despicable [[02:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9884.699999999999s)]
*  You are despicable because you knew you knew your client had done this and you you you did a fine job representing him [[02:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9888.539999999999s)]
*  But you were about to go into trial and try to blame four other people by name [[02:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9894.94s)]
*  She was going to blame four guys you guys [[02:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9899.66s)]
*  She and brian colberger were going to team up and go point the finger at people they knew were innocent [[02:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9902.38s)]
*  And only this judge hippler important to emphasize [[02:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9909.34s)]
*  It's a p not a t in the middle of that name [[02:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9913.1s)]
*  Stop them and that's what put him in this compromised position. Go ahead phil [[02:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9916.54s)]
*  Yeah, you can't you can't go and just willy-nilly blame people without [[02:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9920.86s)]
*  One scintilla of evidence and the judge absolutely made the right call but speaking of the study of criminology and criminal justice [[02:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9925.58s)]
*  My undergraduate degree is in criminal justice [[02:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9933.42s)]
*  And so I consider myself sort of a lifelong student of crime and criminology [[02:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9936.460000000001s)]
*  And so it occurs to me, you know this person [[02:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9941.92s)]
*  Has he he has this arrogance about him [[02:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9945.12s)]
*  Okay [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9948.0s)]
*  It's what that's what comes across to me when I see [[02:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9948.480000000001s)]
*  The selfies and and all of that stuff that where he's like proud of what he's done [[02:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9951.36s)]
*  So think about moving forward for him. He's going to have criminologists and psychologists and uh people in [[02:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9956.480000000001s)]
*  Academia they're going to be going to visit him in prison for as long as he's there [[02:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9964.7s)]
*  And they're going to be studying him and he's going to enjoy it. It's going to feed into his [[02:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9971.84s)]
*  Um arrogance and it's going to make him [[02:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9979.04s)]
*  Feel like he's done something now to finally put himself on the map to be worth something [[02:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9982.08s)]
*  Uh in the world and to me that is why this plea deal is so tragic [[02:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9988.0s)]
*  Because he gets to spend his days having his ego stroked by academicians [[02:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=9994.560000000001s)]
*  As opposed to sitting there worrying about whether or not the firing squad is going to hit the right place [[02:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10000.019999999999s)]
*  And I don't know that the prosecutor has given any of that [[02:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10006.179999999998s)]
*  one [[02:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10010.58s)]
*  Fault, uh as far as determining what is justice in this particular case because I don't know [[02:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10011.38s)]
*  We're on pins and needles to see if kathryn ramsland is going to get the interview. She wants here is that exchange in sop 48 [[02:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10017.46s)]
*  Would you want to study [[02:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10024.68s)]
*  brian coberger [[02:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10027.560000000001s)]
*  Have you put any thought into that is that something that you think could be possible? [[02:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10029.560000000001s)]
*  I've been thinking about that for two and a half years [[02:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10035.240000000002s)]
*  um [[02:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10038.28s)]
*  I would I mean this is this is my work if he [[02:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10039.08s)]
*  Wanted to do that. I would uh, I know that he's got the intellectual capacity to do it to be self-reflective to help [[02:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10043.560000000001s)]
*  To do it to be self-reflective to help [[02:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10050.92s)]
*  Think through how his life came to this [[02:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10054.2s)]
*  and so I would definitely do it if he were willing and [[02:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10057.32s)]
*  It would be hard [[02:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10062.28s)]
*  But I think because I have so much material from him [[02:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10063.64s)]
*  I have questions for him that I think nobody else but me could ask [[02:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10067.88s)]
*  Fair enough, but matt murphy that there's nothing to stop that from happening, right? [[02:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10073.64s)]
*  She's allowed to go do it [[02:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10077.48s)]
*  I was talking to ashley banfield yesterday on her podcast saying we watched this happen in the um [[02:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10078.84s)]
*  In the watts trial where the father who killed his wife and their two baby girls and put them in the [[02:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10083.8s)]
*  Disgusting towers and let them anyway, it was awful [[02:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10090.52s)]
*  He started talking when he got into jail. He got a girlfriend [[02:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10094.119999999999s)]
*  He had law enforcement come visit him and he started singing like a canary [[02:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10097.24s)]
*  Once he got behind bars in a couple of years had passed and he no longer cared [[02:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10101.32s)]
*  Well, one of the things that's really interesting about what we just listened to megan on the [[02:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10104.76s)]
*  The the thing that he wrote he he hit on there's a thing called the hair psychopathy checklist that has the [[02:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10109.16s)]
*  the [[02:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10116.6s)]
*  Essentially the character traits of the psychopath and when he talks about having no remorse and grandiosity [[02:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10117.48s)]
*  All of those are hallmark signs of the psychopath and what I think is really interesting about [[02:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10124.28s)]
*  um [[02:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10130.52s)]
*  Katherine rams on is that [[02:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10131.88s)]
*  It speaks like her the fact that she had no clue [[02:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10134.119999999999s)]
*  Is one of the insidious things about serial killers and about psychopaths is that they tend to be highly intelligent [[02:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10138.039999999999s)]
*  They tend to be manipulative and charming and they could be in line in front of us at a starbucks [[02:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10145.32s)]
*  And we would never know and that is one of the fascinating things and this and one of the scary things [[02:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10150.44s)]
*  About this personality type and I think it's I think it's very very interesting that letter that we just that [[02:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10156.279999999999s)]
*  That we just listened to that he wrote because he basically checks off a bunch of the hallmark [[02:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10162.519999999999s)]
*  Things and saying that he's got no remorse [[02:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10168.92s)]
*  And then and then the one thing he absolutely got right that he was honest about is when he called himself an asshole [[02:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10170.679999999998s)]
*  Because at the bottom line that's what these guys are it's and not every psychopath turns into a murderer [[02:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10176.039999999999s)]
*  In fact, most of them don't but they're always they put themselves first. They're highly narcissistic. They tend to you know, [[02:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10181.64s)]
*  They they have no morals. They have no um, there's nothing wrong with the moral compass [[02:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10188.199999999999s)]
*  They know right from wrong, but they choose to do the wrong thing when it benefits them and sometimes it's just benefiting [[02:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10192.68s)]
*  Um, their sorted sexual desires [[02:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10199.72s)]
*  So I think that this case is interesting and look to the extent that he would participate maybe she can learn something who knows? [[02:50:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10201.8s)]
*  Um, but this case is fascinating as tragic as it's fascinating [[02:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10209.32s)]
*  He asked her the 64 000 question, which is it gets to what I think she was about to testify to [[02:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10214.6s)]
*  She is as interesting as all that was it's not what she was going to testify to the question is like [[02:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10219.56s)]
*  What did you see about him and what did you teach in the class? [[02:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10224.12s)]
*  That might be relevant to this case and here is that which is the most newsmaking piece of the interview in [[02:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10228.04s)]
*  uh [[02:50:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10234.84s)]
*  What is it? [[02:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10236.12s)]
*  Yeah 44 you guys got it [[02:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10238.2s)]
*  Can you say dr ramslin what it was looking back now? [[02:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10240.28s)]
*  Um that sort of raises your eyebrows [[02:50:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10244.2s)]
*  Specifically in terms of things in the class [[02:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10247.300000000001s)]
*  Um, I think just the idea of wanting to study [[02:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10251.640000000001s)]
*  um [[02:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10255.800000000001s)]
*  Offenders and what their thought process was how they felt about their crimes [[02:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10256.84s)]
*  um [[02:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10263.880000000001s)]
*  Wanting to study that and then finding out [[02:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10264.76s)]
*  This is a person who who then is now? [[02:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10269.0s)]
*  Saying he's guilty of doing these things. I have to look at the framework of what I taught and wonder did I inspire him? [[02:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10273.160000000002s)]
*  in some way did I [[02:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10281.08s)]
*  You know, but I can't I can't second guess that because I may have inspired [[02:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10284.04s)]
*  Somebody else to become an fbi agent [[02:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10289.560000000001s)]
*  And that's unfortunately in this field. You know, that's what we live with [[02:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10292.6s)]
*  Um, I mean I'll ask you i'll give that one to you matt because you're also on the side of you know [[02:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10298.6s)]
*  They say there's a fine line sometimes between the cop and the criminal [[02:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10303.880000000001s)]
*  um [[02:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10307.240000000002s)]
*  It was she was an interesting person. She was she sort of had a light affect throughout the interview. She was smiling [[02:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10308.28s)]
*  I when I think it's probably i'm not judging her when you're a reporter even you get gallows humor [[02:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10314.12s)]
*  You know, I you guys know that too you reported on enough cases just as legal commentators and you as a journalist howard [[02:51:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10319.08s)]
*  Sometimes you laugh in inappropriate situations and with your team, you know [[02:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10325.24s)]
*  You just have to because you deal so much in darkness and that's her life [[02:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10328.28s)]
*  But I do wonder like how do you how do you go to sleep at night? If you think you inspired brian kohlberger? [[02:52:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10332.44s)]
*  Well, I yeah, I think that this is almost like family members and it's a chicken or egg thing [[02:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10339.720000000001s)]
*  Um, I think that psychopaths are born far far more often than they're actually made [[02:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10345.48s)]
*  That's my personal opinion and having dealt with a bunch of them including a bunch of them that represented themselves in court [[02:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10351.08s)]
*  Which is another hallmark of the psychopathic slash [[02:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10356.28s)]
*  Extreme narcissist personality, but this isn't her fault and it's not his family's fault [[02:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10359.48s)]
*  Um, I haven't heard one inkling of true abuse [[02:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10364.52s)]
*  But you so often you don't that's another big myth when it comes to serial killers megan is that [[02:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10368.6s)]
*  What could possibly have made them do that? [[02:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10373.640000000001s)]
*  We all harken back to buffalo bill from silence of the lambs and we think about these tortured souls [[02:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10375.64s)]
*  That were subject to horrific abuse [[02:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10380.68s)]
*  The reality is most of these guys the big the big answer is why do they do it? [[02:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10382.76s)]
*  It's because they want to do it. They get off on it. They enjoy it [[02:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10387.56s)]
*  And for lack of a better term as disturbing as it is [[02:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10390.68s)]
*  It's fun for them and that's you know, and that's not this woman's fault [[02:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10393.72s)]
*  I think it's the other way around. I think he was fascinated. He was drawn to it [[02:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10397.32s)]
*  He went into this because of who he was to begin with [[02:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10400.68s)]
*  I don't think she made him. Um, and as far as the gallows humor, um, yeah, she's removed from that [[02:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10404.039999999999s)]
*  I don't think she she meant to be [[02:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10409.48s)]
*  You know, uh unsensitive or insensitive to the victims or their families. Um, you know, she's an academic [[02:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10411.8s)]
*  And it's and at the end of the day just like it's not it's not her fault. It's usually not family members fault. Usually [[02:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10418.76s)]
*  This this this lands on the shoulders of brian coberger himself and to deal today [[02:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10425.48s)]
*  That is the responsibility of that prosecutor that that cut him the break [[02:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10430.679999999998s)]
*  Here's here's a defense for the prosecutor justin from the family of maddie mogan kaylee's best friend [[02:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10435.0s)]
*  Um, this is via mbc news that her family's saying it's they support the plea agreement 100 [[02:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10442.439999999999s)]
*  In a statement read by their attorney outside of the courthouse the family members. Thank late talk county prosecutor bill thompson [[02:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10448.599999999999s)]
*  As those who do not support the agreement to quote respect our belief [[02:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10454.84s)]
*  That this is the best outcome possible for the victims their families in the state of idaho [[02:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10458.44s)]
*  We lost our maddie our kind loving vivacious and caring daughter full of purpose and promise [[02:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10462.28s)]
*  We are grateful for the gift of her life and we have grieved the loss of that life during each of these [[02:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10467.800000000001s)]
*  962 days [[02:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10473.14s)]
*  God that feels so real when you're when you've lost somebody [[02:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10474.6s)]
*  Especially to violent crime to be counting it in the number of days. I mean [[02:54:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10478.12s)]
*  That's that sounds so real and so there is a split. I mean does that change your opinion at all phil hollaway about [[02:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10483.48s)]
*  the prosecution's decision you've got [[02:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10489.960000000001s)]
*  Maddie's parents in support of it. You've got ethan's parents in support of it [[02:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10492.2s)]
*  You've got steve gonsalves against it and we don't know about zanna's parents [[02:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10496.2s)]
*  You know, it doesn't change my my opinion on balance because I felt like unless there was unanimity [[02:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10501.24s)]
*  uh on the [[02:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10507.32s)]
*  On the part of the victims families they needed to go forward as planned [[02:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10509.16s)]
*  But now that being said I do fully understand where this family is coming from because after all [[02:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10512.52s)]
*  They don't have to sit through this trial that would have lasted for weeks on end. They would have been there every day [[02:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10518.68s)]
*  No doubt they don't have to [[02:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10523.56s)]
*  Worry every time there's an appeals court that issues a ruling that might uh overturn something and require a second trial [[02:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10526.2s)]
*  Uh, they don't have to worry [[02:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10534.119999999999s)]
*  Uh for the next several decades whether there's going to be something that [[02:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10536.2s)]
*  Undoes this trial and they got to live through it all over again and then they don't have to relive it [[02:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10539.880000000001s)]
*  When that moment of execution were it ever to arrive? [[02:55:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10544.84s)]
*  All of these things would have [[02:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10549.0s)]
*  Kept the memory of this horrible tragedy in their lives [[02:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10551.0s)]
*  At the front and center for the rest of their lives and at some point [[02:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10555.560000000001s)]
*  I think we all as human beings know that families need to be able to move on they need a little bit of closure [[02:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10559.08s)]
*  And so I fully understand why certain families including that one [[02:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10565.24s)]
*  Um would support ending the proceedings in this way [[02:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10571.0s)]
*  However, I think that there's also a broader societal interest [[02:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10575.0s)]
*  In having this case tried to the public or in public so that we could have seen behind the curtain and we could have learned [[02:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10579.48s)]
*  the why of it all because [[02:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10585.8s)]
*  Apparently we're never going to learn why he did this we can study it [[02:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10588.04s)]
*  We can speculate unless katherine gets it out of him. Maybe he'll talk to his former teacher [[02:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10592.04s)]
*  Maybe he's looking forward to being studied by her phil [[02:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10595.880000000001s)]
*  Maybe he will but is he going to ever tell the truth and we don't know we don't know can I understand the victims? [[02:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10599.080000000002s)]
*  Who do want to get this behind them and and that look? [[02:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10604.76s)]
*  I just think on balance if I were the prosecutor I would have wanted all of the families on board with this [[02:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10608.28s)]
*  Can I add to that megan real briefly? [[02:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10614.6s)]
*  You get that information from the families before you announce whether or not you're seeking for the death penalty [[02:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10616.92s)]
*  You you you factor that in california [[02:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10621.72s)]
*  We call it a lives-de-hearing and it's a it's a very important sober [[02:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10624.68s)]
*  Formal process that a da goes through and you have all the time in the world to announce that there's no statute [[02:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10629.08s)]
*  Where or time limit on how long it takes to consider that and a good da will consider all those factors before they make our announcement [[02:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10635.32s)]
*  And I don't see why that wasn't considered here ahead of time again [[02:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10643.0s)]
*  You make the call based on the information you have all those families were available to talk to him [[02:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10647.16s)]
*  And I offer zero criticism to any of the family members in this [[02:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10651.960000000001s)]
*  But my criticism is directed at the da. He should have learned all that before he announced [[02:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10656.04s)]
*  He was seeking the death penalty [[02:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10661.0s)]
*  So you don't you don't go after it and then change your mind down the line all that was available at the time [[02:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10662.44s)]
*  I mean his behavior I just want to add a little bit more color [[02:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10668.04s)]
*  Standby howard then you can take it via mbc inside the courtroom [[02:57:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10670.76s)]
*  Several family members seated in the gallery were crying as the hearing went on christy gonzales. That's caley's mom [[02:57:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10675.08s)]
*  Silently sobbed as the judge read caley's name an aunt of caley's had her head down holding her forehead [[02:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10682.68s)]
*  It was also weeping the aunt also sobbed when prosecutors spoke about blood on the murder weapon [[02:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10688.28s)]
*  Which that was the first time i'd heard that the girl's blood was on [[02:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10693.800000000001s)]
*  Was on the knife sheet that they found blood on the knife sheath in addition to coberger's dna [[02:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10697.880000000001s)]
*  Madison mogan's father ben looked agitated was breathing heavily rubbing his eyes with a handkerchief [[02:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10703.08s)]
*  He did not look at colberger while he answered the judge's questions. I'm sure he couldn't even I mean think about it as a dad [[02:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10709.32s)]
*  Madison mogan's father ben and and caley's father steve [[02:58:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10716.36s)]
*  Couldn't even go in there. They I mean he couldn't go in there and ben couldn't look at him [[02:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10720.76s)]
*  Because of course, it's a dad's job every dad knows this and feels this to protect his daughter [[02:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10725.32s)]
*  And these girls were young they were [[02:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10731.48s)]
*  21 years old and their dads weren't there and of course no one would have expected them to be there [[02:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10734.02s)]
*  but that would be your feeling as you sat there or or [[02:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10739.16s)]
*  Got the news about what had happened to them that day the human element here is just so jarring guys [[02:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10744.12s)]
*  Well, I mean it was a moment of high drama and that makes the the district attorney's behavior so capricious [[02:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10751.4s)]
*  I mean, it's just uncivilized and rude not to have [[02:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10758.28s)]
*  Confronted them first and tell them exactly what's happening to guide them through this to try to make this entire [[02:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10762.52s)]
*  Horrible experience as easy as possible. It can be it's going to be an impossible experience [[02:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10769.320000000002s)]
*  Anyway, your duty as a public servant and as a feeling human being is to help [[02:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10774.84s)]
*  Them through this and not just give them emails telling them what's happening [[02:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10780.84s)]
*  Yeah, and that's the real that's the real [[02:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10785.64s)]
*  I think that's almost the worst of it as a father [[02:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10788.36s)]
*  uh, you know of a of a daughter, um and a son, but these these college girls, um, [[02:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10791.24s)]
*  they they you know, they they look like they they could easily be any of our children and and and it's [[02:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10798.28s)]
*  To think about you're just going to get this information by an email. I mean, it's just [[03:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10804.92s)]
*  I know you're searching you're searching up. You like your random correspondence and then you learn this [[03:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10810.759999999998s)]
*  It's rude. It's just bad form and I you know [[03:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10815.64s)]
*  I hope the voters in idaho remember how this case was dealt with in the end because um, [[03:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10818.439999999999s)]
*  you know [[03:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10825.48s)]
*  Whether or not they did a good job in their legal presentations in court and argued the motions correctly and did all the right things [[03:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10826.599999999999s)]
*  the way they went about [[03:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10833.56s)]
*  Informing these families of the conclusion of this is just in my view [[03:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10835.96s)]
*  unforgivable utterly unforgivable [[03:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10841.619999999999s)]
*  And by the way to the point that we were discussing earlier and matt said this is totally possible the thing that steve gonzalves said [[03:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10843.88s)]
*  First he said it's not over till the plea is accepted and he did want people to contact the courthouse to express their thoughts [[03:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10850.76s)]
*  Which he was chastised for but secondly, he said at a bare minimum i'm reading here [[03:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10855.88s)]
*  Please require a full confession [[03:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10860.84s)]
*  Full accountability location of the murder weapon confirmation the defendant acted alone and the true facts of what happened that night [[03:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10863.64s)]
*  We deserve to know when the beginning of the end was [[03:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10871.56s)]
*  Oh my god, that is so [[03:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10876.28s)]
*  Well put and I can understand a dad's need to know that when when did my daughter [[03:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10878.52s)]
*  Come into your mind as the subject of murder and we do believe [[03:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10884.36s)]
*  not steve's daughter, but we believe that maddie mogan was the [[03:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10889.08s)]
*  original intended victim [[03:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10892.599999999999s)]
*  We'll put their pictures back up because [[03:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10895.24s)]
*  We understand that kaylee had already left this it's ethan [[03:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10897.8s)]
*  Um, and then that's maddie and then and then that's kaylee and then that's zana the bernett [[03:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10901.56s)]
*  Okay [[03:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10907.64s)]
*  So we believe that maddie who's next to ethan in this photo was his intended victim because she was the one [[03:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10908.039999999999s)]
*  He went right up to the third floor. He didn't even stop at the second floor [[03:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10914.599999999999s)]
*  He clearly knew where she was and kaylee's presence in the bed that night or even in the house was unexpected [[03:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10917.16s)]
*  She had moved out. She was only back for a night [[03:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10922.52s)]
*  So we the speculation is that he was surprised to find kaylee again there in the sunglasses [[03:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10925.4s)]
*  that he was surprised to find her in with maddie and [[03:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10931.88s)]
*  You know you hear maddie's parents just weeping at the mention of her name and all these others whose children got swept into it [[03:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10935.64s)]
*  Because the psychopath entered an unlocked house, which is true of virtually all college houses at least before this [[03:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10941.24s)]
*  um who wanted to do [[03:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10947.96s)]
*  A dastardly deed. I gotta pause [[03:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10950.36s)]
*  I'm and i'm gonna say goodbye to you howard and i'm just gonna hold the other guys over for a minute on ditty [[03:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10952.76s)]
*  Thank you howard for everything on this case. You're great reporting and commentary. It's it's always a pleasure you guys. I want to switch [[03:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10957.64s)]
*  All the best. I want to switch to ditty before we before we say goodbye because they had to submit their um [[03:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10964.84s)]
*  their suggested uh [[03:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10971.88s)]
*  Program on whether diddy would be released or would be in jail [[03:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10973.8s)]
*  Pending sentencing and they did that as far as we can see [[03:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10978.119999999999s)]
*  Uh around 130 we got we got one of the submissions. I'm assuming that we got the other one [[03:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10981.56s)]
*  Uh, let's see the inner city press was repete reporting at 2 pm [[03:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10987.4s)]
*  Uh submissions just now of the bail letters by combs and the u.s attorney's office are in the judge will reconvene the parties at 5 pm [[03:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=10991.72s)]
*  And I guess he'll make his decision [[03:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11000.279999999999s)]
*  then [[03:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11002.52s)]
*  but it's pretty crazy [[03:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11003.48s)]
*  the reaction that we're getting now from [[03:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11006.039999999999s)]
*  The families the mother walked out of the courtroom blowing kisses to the fans diddy's mother who's a bizarre. They have a bizarre relationship [[03:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11008.92s)]
*  I'm sorry. There's strange videos on the internet of them calling each other baby and kissing on the mouth like recently [[03:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11016.039999999999s)]
*  It's strange [[03:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11022.68s)]
*  Um, and now we let's see [[03:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11023.88s)]
*  Here's his mother [[03:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11027.08s)]
*  Waving and kissing the crowd now the new york times reporting a lawyer for cassandra ventura [[03:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11028.52s)]
*  Submitted a letter to the judge urging him to deny. Mr. Combs's request for a lease on bond. That's doug wigdor [[03:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11033.320000000002s)]
*  He wrote that miss ventura believes. Mr [[03:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11038.76s)]
*  Combs is likely to pose a danger to the victims who testified in this case including herself as well as to the community [[03:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11040.36s)]
*  Exactly. That's that's what we were trying to say earlier phil like yes agreed [[03:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11045.560000000001s)]
*  So does the judge take that into consideration now that we've heard directly from one of the witnesses and one of his victims [[03:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11050.92s)]
*  You know, it's a no-brainer. He's been convicted. He's he's lost the presumption of innocence at least as to the counts [[03:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11057.480000000001s)]
*  He was convicted of and so [[03:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11063.08s)]
*  You know he's he is somehow he's [[03:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11065.800000000001s)]
*  It makes more sense to give him a bond now [[03:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11068.44s)]
*  No [[03:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11070.6s)]
*  What makes sense is to go ahead and continue letting him serve his time now [[03:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11071.08s)]
*  That that I if I were the judge know that i'm going to be giving him when the sentencing [[03:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11075.64s)]
*  Occurs down the road in a few weeks. Look, he's going to be a danger to others. These people know it the [[03:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11080.6s)]
*  Cassie and the other victims they know it they know that their best hope for safety is if he is locked up and [[03:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11087.8s)]
*  And and does not have that much access to the outside world certainly sending him home to live at his home in miami beach [[03:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11094.68s)]
*  Um would not give any great comfort to these victims [[03:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11101.72s)]
*  He what this judge is doing he's delaying and we talked about this some earlier because he's he's consulting [[03:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11104.92s)]
*  with his colleagues to determine whether or not he needs to [[03:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11110.92s)]
*  Um, just act on this and then say look we're going to keep him in jail or to release him on bond [[03:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11114.039999999999s)]
*  It ought to be automatic. He's been convicted. There's jail time. That's probably in his future [[03:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11119.56s)]
*  He needs to just stay put [[03:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11125.56s)]
*  We don't need to be sitting here waiting until five o'clock on some decision that should have just been automatic [[03:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11127.4s)]
*  It's entirely within the discretion of the judge. He should have immediately [[03:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11132.6s)]
*  Said nope, we're not even going to entertain that at this time sentencing is going to be set for you know, august 10th or whatever [[03:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11136.68s)]
*  And just move on uh move just to keep it clear for the audience [[03:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11143.24s)]
*  This is because we're talking about judges now we switched we've moved [[03:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11146.199999999999s)]
*  Uh to the east and to the north and now we're in a different courtroom [[03:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11149.24s)]
*  This is federal court in the diddy case and judge subramanian a biden appointee who's relatively new to the bench and has to decide [[03:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11153.08s)]
*  Not the guilt or innocence of shawn diddy combs that was decided earlier today guilty on two small counts [[03:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11160.84s)]
*  Smaller and not guilty on the main charges against him for rico and sex trafficking [[03:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11167.56s)]
*  And now this judge has to set a date for sentencing and have recommendations on the sentencing and decide whether diddy will be free [[03:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11173.08s)]
*  Pending uh that sentencing hearing out on bail, which he's not right now [[03:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11180.039999999999s)]
*  Adding to what I just said guys new york times also reporting that diante nash. He was a witness in this case, too [[03:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11184.84s)]
*  stylist and friend of cassie's [[03:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11190.52s)]
*  Uh, he wrote a letter to the judge urging urging him not to release shawn combs in the wake of the mixed verdict [[03:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11192.6s)]
*  Prosecutors filed the letter along with their own asking the judge not to give him bail pending sentencing [[03:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11197.48s)]
*  Nash who testified that he had seen combs beating miss ventura cited quote a long well-documented history of violent coercive and right [[03:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11202.52s)]
*  retaliatory behavior and argued that mr. Combs should stay in custody combs. Mr. Nash wrote [[03:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11209.539999999999s)]
*  Has repeatedly escaped meaningful accountability right on diante nash and if released on wednesday quote [[03:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11214.76s)]
*  I have no doubt he will see it as yet another license to continue intimidating threatening and harming people who challenge [[03:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11220.92s)]
*  or expose him [[03:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11228.6s)]
*  Uh, what do you make of that matt do these witness? [[03:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11230.68s)]
*  And they're not testimonials. They're pleased they're they're begging him [[03:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11234.28s)]
*  Not to release this guy pending the serving of a sentence. Will they have any sway with the judge? [[03:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11237.96s)]
*  They could um, the problem, of course is he wasn't convicted on any of the counts involving them [[03:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11244.039999999999s)]
*  really he was convicted on the two man act violations, which is a [[03:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11249.08s)]
*  it's a very old law that of course just deals with transporting prostitutes over state lines, which um, [[03:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11253.48s)]
*  you know a lot of lonely guys in new york city, uh, whenever they get a [[03:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11260.6s)]
*  They get a hooker to come up on one of those bridges from new jersey. They are technically also committing man act violations [[03:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11264.68s)]
*  so it's a that's an old law back when um morality was really, um, [[03:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11270.6s)]
*  Uh something that the federal government would attempt to enforce upon people. So it depends a little bit on on that [[03:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11276.12s)]
*  but look, um [[03:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11282.6s)]
*  remember megan when [[03:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11284.68s)]
*  One of the reasons why all the previous attempts at at bail were rejected by this judge is that diddy? [[03:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11286.84s)]
*  While in custody was borrowing other inmates calling numbers and the allegation from the prosecution was he was actually attempting [[03:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11293.56s)]
*  To intimidate witnesses from the jail. I think that could weigh in I think it's also [[03:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11300.119999999999s)]
*  If he is going to give him time for man act violations [[03:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11305.72s)]
*  Uh, you know, he'll probably keep him in but if if his intent is to give him credit time serve for that because they really are [[03:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11311.0s)]
*  the least [[03:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11318.119999999999s)]
*  um [[03:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11319.32s)]
*  You really think he might not get time [[03:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11320.28s)]
*  Any things he was charged with um, he he could potentially release him. I don't disagree with anything that phil just said but it's um, [[03:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11322.52s)]
*  It'll be very telling I think um [[03:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11329.400000000001s)]
*  If he releases him on bond, it means he's probably not intending on unsensing him any more time [[03:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11332.2s)]
*  Which could be one of the outcomes here [[03:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11337.0s)]
*  Yeah, that was can I ask you about that because there is also a theory that the man act could get ruled [[03:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11339.24s)]
*  Invalid that there could be an appeal on that on that [[03:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11345.140000000001s)]
*  Statute itself which which was originally I guess passed to to [[03:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11348.6s)]
*  capture black men who were pimping out white women and there's a racial element to it and [[03:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11353.160000000002s)]
*  You know, they did play the race card in this with this jury, you know [[03:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11359.160000000002s)]
*  That's the first thing they said when they stood up there. This is a black man [[03:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11362.68s)]
*  What has he ever done? [[03:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11366.12s)]
*  They implicated during the course of the trial that the prosecutors brought the charges for what reason why him? [[03:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11367.160000000002s)]
*  And the judge tried to shut that down, but that horse had already left the barn [[03:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11373.320000000002s)]
*  So there's a real you know, there's a question about whether diddy's lawyers are going to appeal that conviction saying it's a racist statue [[03:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11376.6s)]
*  It's outdated. It should be overturned [[03:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11383.880000000001s)]
*  I don't know. There's do you think they have a leg to stand on there matt? [[03:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11386.68s)]
*  I mean look [[03:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11390.92s)]
*  It's a sad state of our current world megan. I think you agree with me where race is injected to freaking everything [[03:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11392.68s)]
*  Um, I I think it is an old law, uh, but I don't think I really [[03:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11399.08s)]
*  It just makes my skin crawl when you're talking about um [[03:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11403.08s)]
*  Making a racial argument on that. I don't think it gets reversed on that. Um [[03:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11408.2s)]
*  Mike it you know the man act is it's the law and I don't I don't I don't think that it's going to get reversed [[03:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11412.36s)]
*  um [[03:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11417.8s)]
*  because of this case, but it [[03:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11418.76s)]
*  It is uh, it's it's it's a moral law. It is arguably outdated, but it is still currently the law [[03:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11421.16s)]
*  Okay, wait now I want to switch. I want to keep going on this because [[03:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11428.12s)]
*  Now i've had a little time to think about what happened here and I [[03:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11432.679999999998s)]
*  I got a lot of thoughts. I mean my my friend said [[03:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11436.92s)]
*  Why like my friend was texting me? She's been watching like why did this happen? [[03:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11440.199999999999s)]
*  And I have to say I do think there's a multitude of answers, but one of them is [[03:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11443.64s)]
*  celebrity [[03:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11449.939999999999s)]
*  um privilege [[03:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11451.48s)]
*  money [[03:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11453.72s)]
*  and the race element they did play the race card and [[03:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11455.08s)]
*  The there had there had been criticism of like the prosecutors for being too white [[03:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11459.8s)]
*  There was a there was an analyst a legal analyst and msnbc who is raising this point. We cut it. I'll play it watch [[03:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11464.68s)]
*  Well, and also there are some racial dynamics here on that were at play and I think both the gender and the racial dynamics are worth [[03:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11472.52s)]
*  talking about [[03:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11478.44s)]
*  Earlier this spring I went to cover an unrelated event down near the federal courthouses and I was there on may 1st [[03:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11479.64s)]
*  When I saw all six of the prosecutors on this team walk from their office, which is now at the court of international trade [[03:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11486.359999999999s)]
*  To the courtroom itself and they filed in a single file line and they are all white women to a person [[03:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11493.88s)]
*  Six of them and they almost look like lawyer barbies proceeding as they were walking to the court [[03:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11501.4s)]
*  It's not lost on me that particularly given who the defendant was [[03:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11507.56s)]
*  And in a jury that not only was mixed by gender but had from my count at least seven people of color on it [[03:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11511.8s)]
*  That that dynamic may not have gone over particularly well with them [[03:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11519.8s)]
*  You can't say she's wrong I mean in in new york city [[03:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11526.52s)]
*  The race of the defendant the race of all the prosecutors. I don't agree with any of that [[03:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11530.6s)]
*  I mean, I think it's outrageous. You can have a white woman prosecute a black man. That's just fine [[03:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11535.24s)]
*  By the way black men got the right to vote before white women did if we wanted to have a battle of oppression oppression [[03:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11540.6s)]
*  Which is what the left wants to do? [[03:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11546.36s)]
*  um in any event [[03:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11548.2s)]
*  Maybe that was a factor because I I just can't believe that if you had [[03:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11550.12s)]
*  Phil Holloway sitting there with all that proof against a phil holloway. This would have been the result phil [[03:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11554.84s)]
*  Well, you know over at msnbc there and on the left in general their obsession with race and gender is [[03:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11561.560000000001s)]
*  Is quite frankly very tiresome now it has been for some time [[03:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11568.199999999999s)]
*  now [[03:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11573.0s)]
*  Whether or not race or gender played a part in the jury's verdict [[03:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11574.119999999999s)]
*  Maybe and that's a question that the jurors themselves might have to answer [[03:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11579.24s)]
*  You know, we heard some I think truth come out of some jurors after the oj trial that decided, you know [[03:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11583.16s)]
*  Look, we said we weren't going to convict a a black man. So it race did bleed over into that high profile case [[03:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11589.4s)]
*  Maybe it had something to do with this, although this was a mixed verdict [[03:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11597.4s)]
*  um [[03:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11602.039999999999s)]
*  look this whole thing about [[03:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11603.0s)]
*  Diddy and his [[03:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11606.28s)]
*  His danger to the community all of that still exists [[03:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11608.36s)]
*  Uh, and this judge would be well served to remember that he the judge is entitled and should remember all of the testimony [[03:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11613.0s)]
*  And all the evidence from the trial even things that went to the charges for which he was acquitted [[03:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11620.92s)]
*  Because that should inform the judge's decision about what that's okay by that. I mean consider that [[03:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11626.84s)]
*  I'm sorry [[03:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11634.68s)]
*  My question is that's okay for the judge to consider evidence that was introduced at trial [[03:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11635.800000000001s)]
*  Even if he wasn't convicted of those counts like if the judge, you know, he heard evidence that he committed arson against kid cutty's car [[03:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11639.720000000001s)]
*  but the jury [[03:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11647.32s)]
*  They didn't really issue a direct finding on that because they may have thought he did that but didn't do another thing [[03:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11648.76s)]
*  That would have created a rico charge but [[03:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11653.24s)]
*  Can the judge factor in all of the terrible evidence against him that appears to have been disregarded by the jury when he imposes sentence met? [[03:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11655.4s)]
*  well as as they say the the the only [[03:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11663.72s)]
*  Entity more powerful on a federal judge is god right in the united states and that's that's something to eat here in law school [[03:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11667.0s)]
*  So judge can consider anything he wants what what he makes a record of [[03:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11673.24s)]
*  Um gets a little bit more dicey, but if I could just go back to that previous question [[03:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11677.16s)]
*  You know, I prosecuted a lot of a lot of [[03:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11681.48s)]
*  I mean that sort of the united colors of benetton over the course of my career [[03:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11685.16s)]
*  I hope I don't offend anybody by saying that but I mean in southern, california [[03:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11688.6s)]
*  You have a very diverse jury pool contrary to popular opinion orange county is very diverse and [[03:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11693.08s)]
*  You know the idea msnbc. I don't know who that woman was that was talking. I don't think that [[03:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11700.76s)]
*  She's ever prosecuted a case. She certainly hasn't prosecuted a serious one that i'm aware of [[03:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11706.12s)]
*  And you know if her theory was right christopher darden would have convicted oj with all the evidence [[03:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11710.6s)]
*  They had or terry white would have convicted. Uh, the the police officers that that uh beat roddy king [[03:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11715.320000000002s)]
*  um, so it [[03:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11721.640000000001s)]
*  I think what really came in here megan was that you can't when you're talking about professorial [[03:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11723.320000000002s)]
*  um a presentation and I thought they did a decent job of laying out the law you [[03:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11730.44s)]
*  You keep the personality and the skill and the talent of the actual [[03:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11735.88s)]
*  Trial lawyers in a case like that does matter and when you have one that's personable and cracking jokes that the jury is relating to [[03:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11740.68s)]
*  The defense lawyer here that gave the closing was also white so I I reject her comments on that [[03:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11747.32s)]
*  Holy and i've had plenty of people of color [[03:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11752.52s)]
*  I've had people of color on every jury i've ever done of the 133 jury trials I did and that's just like that's sort of your [[03:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11755.8s)]
*  Typical msnbc nonsense by the way most of the witnesses against sean combs were people of color [[03:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11761.88s)]
*  They were black or they were asian or both and I mean right [[03:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11768.279999999999s)]
*  That's just that when you see everything through the lot of race [[03:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11771.88s)]
*  It doesn't surprise me that that she's criticizing and by the way calling them um calling those women [[03:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11774.759999999998s)]
*  Saying they look like a bunch of barbies is a pejorative that a lot of women should be offended by those women [[03:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11780.359999999999s)]
*  Even though they didn't bring it home [[03:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11785.8s)]
*  They got uh, they got them they got them on two counts they you know to their credit [[03:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11788.279999999999s)]
*  They took a run at a very famous very wealthy guy [[03:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11792.279999999999s)]
*  um, and [[03:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11795.56s)]
*  You know to throw them under the bus there. It's a bunch of barbies [[03:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11797.0s)]
*  Um, I thought race was supposed to be bad msnbc. Um, not not so much [[03:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11799.8s)]
*  Well, you know, you know what the real sin is like I I don't actually know what they look like [[03:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11804.359999999999s)]
*  But if they were attractive I can see why this woman making the comment didn't like them [[03:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11807.88s)]
*  Uh, i'll leave it at that the diddy defense has proposed the following bail package [[03:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11811.72s)]
*  A 1 million dollar bond [[03:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11815.96s)]
*  Cosigned by sean combs his mother his sister and the mother of his oldest daughter [[03:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11818.199999999999s)]
*  Mr [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11822.6s)]
*  combs's travel will be restricted restricted to the southern district of florida central district of california and the southern district of new york to attend court [[03:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11822.92s)]
*  As well as the eastern district of new york and the district of new jersey only to the extent his travel [[03:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11830.52s)]
*  That his travel to and from new york involves an airport in those districts. He's got to fly private. Let's not forget [[03:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11835.24s)]
*  Mr. Combs's passport will be surrendered [[03:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11840.199999999999s)]
*  Drug testing is ordered all other standard conditions of pretrial supervision. That's his proposal [[03:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11842.68s)]
*  I just want you to know as you consider that phil holloway that um, here's the sketch artist rendering of diddy after he had learned the verdict [[03:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11848.6s)]
*  literally on his knees [[03:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11857.380000000001s)]
*  Praying on his chair. This is what the judge allowed to happen in his courtroom [[03:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11860.2s)]
*  Praying to god with whom i'm sure he has a really tight relationship [[03:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11866.68s)]
*  I'm sure he's super tight with god just you know [[03:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11869.8s)]
*  You brought the bible in there every day just to remind us what a god-fearing man he is as his supporters [[03:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11872.359999999999s)]
*  Are outside actually we have a sock cut of it. Here's one woman [[03:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11878.84s)]
*  People are chanting around her. It's not rico. It's freako [[03:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11883.32s)]
*  And here's the woman. Um, let's watch it and i'll explain what we're seeing [[03:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11888.359999999999s)]
*  I don't know what she's gonna do y'all [[03:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11892.38s)]
*  She's jumping with very large breasts and [[03:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11897.34s)]
*  Spraying baby oil on herself and others [[03:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11902.14s)]
*  She's wearing a bright blue wig she took the wig off [[03:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11906.94s)]
*  She's wearing next to nothing. She's shaking her breasts and pouring baby oil on herself [[03:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11910.14s)]
*  I'm, sorry, but this is what the prosecutors were up against [[03:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11915.34s)]
*  Well, I mean if that's what's on the jury no wonder they lost that you know, we don't [[03:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11918.699999999999s)]
*  I don't know that that's on the jury. We the jury's anonymous to us other than random descriptions. I don't know [[03:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11924.3s)]
*  The day and that is juror number 25 that's [[03:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11931.9s)]
*  You know we we we can have another entire show discussing [[03:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11937.5s)]
*  How people should comport themselves in public or certainly in in courtrooms? [[03:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11942.539999999999s)]
*  And I don't know where things went wrong, but I know that that that's not it. Okay, that's not okay [[03:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11946.78s)]
*  But the judge to allow some of the outbursts and things like that that we saw take place in the courtroom [[03:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11953.42s)]
*  Uh, you know, that's a head scratcher [[03:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11959.34s)]
*  um [[03:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11961.66s)]
*  That this is going on outside the courtroom. That's you know, sadly that's not so much of a head scratcher for me [[03:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11962.7s)]
*  I can kind of i'm not surprised at all one bit. Yeah, that's well it just shows you the power of celebrity [[03:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11968.78s)]
*  And money and I don't think he's going to change one bit [[03:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11976.24s)]
*  In fact, this is one comfort I have in the wake of diddy's acquittal on the most serious charges [[03:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11980.16s)]
*  Here's my one comfort [[03:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11986.08s)]
*  Much in the same way. I feel like the the most serious counts against him were nullified by his fame and his celebrity [[03:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11987.92s)]
*  They had to find him guilty on on the transportation of prostitutes [[03:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11992.880000000001s)]
*  It was so obvious it would have been so obvious if they had not found him guilty on those that they were just in the bag [[03:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=11995.6s)]
*  for him [[03:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12000.720000000001s)]
*  So but the reason I think he got off largely was I think they were dazzled [[03:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12001.92s)]
*  I do I think they were dazzled by his celebrity his power his money [[03:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12006.16s)]
*  Just like he dazzled everybody who took the witness stand and they all talked about that how he like cast a spell on them [[03:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12010.56s)]
*  He was a godlike figure and that's sadly how a lot of americans are when it comes to super powerful super wealthy [[03:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12016.960000000001s)]
*  Super famous people but the same was true of oj simpson [[03:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12022.8s)]
*  And I believe that just like oj simpson a man who's engaged in this many crimes [[03:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12027.2s)]
*  For this long a time like shawn combs is not going to stop [[03:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12033.52s)]
*  He feels more emboldened and empowered to violate the law with impunity than ever now [[03:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12038.320000000002s)]
*  And I give him seven years at the outset before he gets arrested again [[03:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12044.480000000001s)]
*  On a charge that will be a lot more difficult to weasel out of [[03:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12049.52s)]
*  And the next time he beats somebody up in the middle of a hotel room, I think you're gonna have a court room a hotel [[03:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12053.84s)]
*  clerk who's a lot more reluctant to hide the tape and not call the cops than those [[03:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12060.560000000001s)]
*  Disgraced security guards at the hotel intercontinental were [[03:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12068.86s)]
*  A place I don't even want to stay anymore having learned that they took the payoff to hide the tape [[03:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12073.12s)]
*  So I think diddy is his own worst enemy [[03:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12077.6s)]
*  And uh, he will make the bed that he will wind up lying in for most of his adult life [[03:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12080.08s)]
*  I predict and it will be in a prison cell not even related to this case. So we'll see [[03:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z1LlWDJZVzE&t=12084.48s)]
