# Truth About Hegseth Smears and Leaks, and Shocking Greenberg Case, w/ Steve Bannon and Nancy Grace
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 22, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0)
*  Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. I'm Megyn Kelly today. We are bringing in Steve Bannon in just a moment [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=0.0s)]
*  But first I want to start with this news update because the story is kind of confusing. So I'm I laid it out for you. Okay [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6.04s)]
*  It's about Pete Hegseth and the knives are out for him. They've never not been out for him [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=13.120000000000001s)]
*  They remain out for him who NPR that bastion of exclusive Trump White House gets [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=17.94s)]
*  Is reporting maybe on his way out the reporting that Trump is looking for a replacement which Trump is denying [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=25.56s)]
*  Now why would NPR have a scoop like that about Trump not matched by Fox News or any other outlet? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=33.8s)]
*  Ask yourself that [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=41.120000000000005s)]
*  Here's how we got here [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=42.760000000000005s)]
*  Someone at the Pentagon has been leaking to the press about very serious matters even top secret matters [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=44.72s)]
*  Like the report that appeared on NBC News in mid-march [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=52.04s)]
*  Revealing that the White House had directed the Pentagon to draw up options to increase American troop presence in Panama [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=56.32s)]
*  To advance the president's goal of reclaiming the Panama Canal. What was that doing in it on NBC News? [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=64.56s)]
*  The report was very specific. It stated quote [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=70.92s)]
*  US Southern Command is developing potential plans for partnering more closely with [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=74.48s)]
*  Panamanian security forces to the less likely option of US troops seizing the Panama Canal [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=81.32s)]
*  By force and quote citing quote to US officials familiar with the planning [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=88.04s)]
*  the Department of Defense began investigating those leaks and [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=94.72s)]
*  Made it known in the press that they would be using polygraphs to get to the bottom of who was behind them [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=99.04s)]
*  Now as with any time a threat like that makes its way into the public eye [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=107.0s)]
*  Via the news one has to wonder are they really going to polygraph everyone or are they just setting some sort of a trap? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=111.0s)]
*  For example first person to complain about the polygraphs is likely someone you want to polygraph or at least look into [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=118.24000000000001s)]
*  And when the course of that investigation [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=124.75999999999999s)]
*  Defense secretary Hagseth wound up firing three of his top aides on [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=127.03999999999999s)]
*  Friday it happened. They were escorted out of the building [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=131.68s)]
*  Those fired include some who had been close to secretary Hagseth before he became secretary [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=134.88s)]
*  Like senior advisor Dan Caldwell who had worked with Pete at Concerned Veterans for America for some nine years [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=140.8s)]
*  Also fired deputy chief of staff Darren Selnick and Colin Carroll chief of staff to the Pentagon's deputy secretary a [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=147.88s)]
*  fourth staffer a press aide named John Elliott [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=156.12s)]
*  Also parted ways with the Pentagon supposedly because he didn't want to be second in command of the comms shop [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=159.96s)]
*  But there's some real sour grapes with this guy [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=165.2s)]
*  He ran to Politico first of all a left-wing rag to say the Pentagon is in disarray [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=168.08s)]
*  Under secretary Hagseth and predicted that Hagseth will be fired by President Trump [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=173.28s)]
*  Almost immediately after Don Trump jr. Took to X and made clear that this guy [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=177.88s)]
*  Mr. Elliott is not America first though. He claims to be and is officially exiled from the movement [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=183.92s)]
*  He's not happy with his guy. Elliott the three alleged leakers, however [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=190.0s)]
*  Remain a bit of a mystery [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=195.23999999999998s)]
*  Why would Pete's top aides including his friend Dan Caldwell? [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=197.72s)]
*  Allegedly leaked to NBC News about alleged war plans [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=201.16s)]
*  Involving the Panama Canal and there were other leaks to like that Elon Musk went over to the Pentagon [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=205.88s)]
*  There were it was there were a few of them. It wasn't just the one but this one would be top secret [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=211.0s)]
*  All we know for sure is that Dan Caldwell appears to be part of MAGA's more non-interventionalist wing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=216.76s)]
*  Which is fine. That's probably how Trump won the election in large part [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=224.12s)]
*  There's absolutely nothing wrong with being non-interventionalist [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=228.32s)]
*  I think the Republican Party in general has had it with the forever wars and the more bellicose nature of some of the party [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=230.8s)]
*  Certainly the neo-cons have become [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=236.32s)]
*  Otherized and almost [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=238.96s)]
*  Enemies to that strain of the party. So there's nothing wrong with Dan Caldwell feeling that way and he does appear to feel that way [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=241.2s)]
*  But the question is was that view abhorrent to the people who fired him? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=248.12s)]
*  To the people who fired him [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=254.24s)]
*  Mr. Caldwell seems to think so [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=256.84000000000003s)]
*  he went on Tucker's podcast last night with his first remarks since he got the axe and [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=258.92s)]
*  In that exchange Caldwell suggests that he was forced out of the Pentagon not because he leaked anything to any member of the press [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=264.2s)]
*  Which he denies doing but because he is anti war with Iran [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=270.6s)]
*  Due to his experiences in Iraq [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=276.72s)]
*  It started really pushing me to where I'm at now in foreign policy [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=279.68s)]
*  like we need to do something differently and it kind of [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=284.28000000000003s)]
*  radicalized me in a [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=288.6s)]
*  certain way on this and really [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=290.88s)]
*  There's an argument that you need to be when you're talking about foreign policy [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=296.0s)]
*  You kind of need to be cold and detached like some people say that realists need to be cold and detached [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=298.72s)]
*  I don't necessarily buy that [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=303.16s)]
*  But [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=307.04s)]
*  You know [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=309.2s)]
*  When I hear about launching a new military operation somebody talk about something my first thought is [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=310.32s)]
*  What's it gonna be like for the guys? What's gonna be like for the the the boys that are gonna be in the front? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=317.6s)]
*  Now the suggestion implies the secretary Hagseth or those who suggested to Hagseth that Caldwell be fired [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=324.48s)]
*  Feel differently than Caldwell does there though. I can tell you [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=331.88s)]
*  Myself from many conversations with Pete over the past six months. He is far from a neocon [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=335.68s)]
*  We've talked all about it. He was much more pro-war as much of the Republican Party was back during the Bush years [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=342.16s)]
*  He signed up he left Princeton to go fight. I mean he was in that mindset which most of us were post 9-eleven [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=348.68s)]
*  that's why he volunteered and fought at Gitmo and in Iraq and [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=356.04s)]
*  in Afghanistan [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=359.68s)]
*  But he's had a serious change of heart from and thanks to those experiences much like Caldwell [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=361.52000000000004s)]
*  Pete is not a neocon [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=368.68s)]
*  honestly, President Trump is the one making the most noise about bombing Iran and [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=370.88s)]
*  Pete's job is to do what President Trump tells him remember this from February with Trump [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=375.68s)]
*  You cannot allow Iran or just about anybody else by the way, but especially Iran because they are very militant [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=380.68s)]
*  I mean, they're very very militant. You can't allow them to have a nuclear weapon [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=388.44s)]
*  But there's two ways of stopping them with bombs or with a written piece of paper [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=392.08s)]
*  I think Iran would love to make a deal and I would love to make a deal with them without bombing them [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=398.08s)]
*  Okay, I mean that's good it's that there's but Trump hasn't taken military action against Iran off the table [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=404.91999999999996s)]
*  It's of course what Israel wants they want the green light for them to do it [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=411.4s)]
*  Which of course will draw all of us into a military conflict with them and their supporters as well [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=414.72s)]
*  This is one of the topics of conversation that Caldwell and Tucker got into today. Well, I listened to today, but it hit last night [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=419.24s)]
*  Well, we can confirm based on our own reporting that mr [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=426.76s)]
*  Caldwell did not have his phone searched nor was he polygraphed before he was escorted out of the Pentagon [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=430.40000000000003s)]
*  He told Tucker that as well [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=437.96000000000004s)]
*  But we do have to point out that those are not the only ways one can be discovered as a leaker [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=439.4s)]
*  One of the ways they used to track confidential information at my old law firm [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=445.84s)]
*  For example was to make everybody log in before they could print a document [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=448.88s)]
*  Do you have that at your company? Maybe if you if you work with sensitive information [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=451.96s)]
*  They make you do that. That was one of the controversies over the Supreme Court when they leaked the Dobbs decision [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=455.52s)]
*  Remember they were like don't they have this system already? [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=460.26s)]
*  Where nothing can be printed without somebody logging in their ID number first? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  Anyway, nothing nothing got printed at my law firm without a record of who did it [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=466.96000000000004s)]
*  That's just one possible way of finding a leaker not to mention one's desktop computer records or email records or possible [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=471.84000000000003s)]
*  Intro office comms between loose-lipped staffers [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=479.36s)]
*  So, you know with all due respect to mr [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=483.76000000000005s)]
*  Caldwell doesn't really answer the question definitively to say they didn't take his phone and they didn't give him a polygraph before they fired him [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=485.48s)]
*  We don't know what they did at the Pentagon [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=491.84000000000003s)]
*  That led them to believe Dan Caldwell and those two others needed to go [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=494.47999999999996s)]
*  Now we have more questions like will Caldwell and these other two turn over their phones voluntarily to the Pentagon [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=499.67999999999995s)]
*  Will they volunteer them? Will the other two? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=506.35999999999996s)]
*  You know come forward and offer their own defenses [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=509.59999999999997s)]
*  Will these three voluntarily return any laptops or other electronics given to them by the Pentagon? [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=512.1999999999999s)]
*  Will they allow the Pentagon to search their personal data? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=519.1999999999999s)]
*  I mean all of this can be obtained rather easily by a warrant [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=522.36s)]
*  Which may well yet be heading mr. Caldwell's way as well as the way of his two now fired colleagues [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=526.48s)]
*  Because while Caldwell told Tucker he would likely already be under arrest if he'd been caught leaking [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=534.0s)]
*  The truth is that oftentimes in fact, I think a lot of the times [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=538.72s)]
*  They fire the suspected leakers [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=542.1600000000001s)]
*  They continue their investigations because they don't want them having ongoing access to confidential information [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=544.48s)]
*  Because they don't want them having ongoing access to confidential information [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=549.44s)]
*  So they fire them they continue the investigations and then when and if they have enough to charge the person [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=552.32s)]
*  Then comes the indictment the handcuffs and the arrest all of which could I don't know but could potentially be in these guys future [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=557.2800000000001s)]
*  I mean now is the time for these three to be cautious. I was kind of shocked to see the one on Tucker's podcast [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=563.6s)]
*  When he's clearing he's going on offense saying I was fired from my iran views not because I leaked [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=569.2s)]
*  We don't know whether that's true. We just don't know right now [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=574.5600000000001s)]
*  I mean I can tell you this when three people are accused of participating in the same allegedly illegal scheme [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=578.08s)]
*  One and only one has the opportunity to cut a deal [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=582.88s)]
*  One and only one has the opportunity to cut a deal [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=585.92s)]
*  And the first one into the pentagon to say choose me is going to get a great one [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=588.88s)]
*  Anyone after that could be looking at prison time potentially [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=592.5600000000001s)]
*  if in fact the pentagon has evidence on leaking that it [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=595.84s)]
*  Certainly seems to feel it does [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=600.0s)]
*  All right getting back to the main story though since those terminations [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=602.48s)]
*  It's been an all-out assault on pete hexeth in the press [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=606.02s)]
*  So when you read these hit pieces on pete, you have to keep that in mind. This isn't coming out of nowhere [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=609.3s)]
*  He he he did nothing to these people. He was running the pentagon [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=614.26s)]
*  Then somebody leaked top secret information to nbc news [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=619.22s)]
*  Then they opened up an investigation at the at the pentagon to figure out who did it and the next thing we knew [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=623.38s)]
*  These guys got fired and now suddenly the field is flooded with hit pieces on hexeth [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=628.9s)]
*  The white house has made clear they think it's these guys behind [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=634.66s)]
*  This is what happens when the entire pentagon is working against you and working against the monumental change that you are trying to implement [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=637.9399999999999s)]
*  And unfortunately, uh, there have been people at that building who don't like the change [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=645.54s)]
*  The secretary is trying to bring so they are leaking and they are lying to the mainstream media [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=650.1s)]
*  We've seen this game played before the secretary is doing a tremendous job and the president stands strongly behind him [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=654.42s)]
*  I [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=660.26s)]
*  Mentioned that guy elliot [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=662.9s)]
*  He wrote a direct hit piece under his own name and politico arguing quote from leaks of sensitive [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=664.58s)]
*  Operational plans to mass firings still pissed about doge. The dysfunction is now a major distraction for the president [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=669.36s)]
*  So what is he talking about talking about these leaks which they investigate and just fired three people for [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=676.58s)]
*  Elliott was not part of that firing. He was something else [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=681.38s)]
*  and [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=684.8199999999999s)]
*  Mass firings doge [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=686.18s)]
*  That that that's the dysfunction what's what's the dysfunction people leaked and unlike in previous administrations [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=688.1s)]
*  Hexeth's trying to do something about it. And yeah doge hit the pentagon same as it hit the other administrative branches [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=694.74s)]
*  What's the dysfunction? [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=701.0600000000001s)]
*  Mr. Elliott [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=702.58s)]
*  Uh and went on to say try to play to trump's vanity saying the president deserves better from his senior leadership and he predicted [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=704.4200000000001s)]
*  Pete will be fired [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=709.7s)]
*  Elsewhere we have [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=711.46s)]
*  Just been seeing the drip drip drip of the chaos narrative [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=713.5400000000001s)]
*  Including news that pete allegedly had a second signal chat going about those huthi attack plans this one not with all the you know [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=716.26s)]
*  Administration officials but with people who are close to him his personal advisors meaning his brother [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=725.68s)]
*  Who works with him at the pentagon now his attorney who also works with him at the pentagon [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=731.06s)]
*  He's military and his wife who doesn't work with him at the pentagon [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=735.14s)]
*  Uh, and would be a controversial person with whom to share [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=739.22s)]
*  You know his huthi attack plans which again the pentagon is saying [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=742.9s)]
*  We're not classified [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=747.22s)]
*  And that could be because they they would have that would have to be because he had declassified them prior to sharing them with anybody [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=748.9s)]
*  Mr. Trump asked about all of this all of this yesterday does second signal chat and the [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=754.66s)]
*  Narrative around pete made very clear. He stands by hexeth [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=761.3s)]
*  Confident [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=765.96s)]
*  Why why do you even ask a question like that we have [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=770.6800000000001s)]
*  Recruitments at that center an all-time high the spirit in the armed forces is fantastic [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=773.7800000000001s)]
*  Are you bringing up signal again? I thought they gave that up two weeks ago [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=779.24s)]
*  There was a new report this weekend that you used in a separate chat that included some family members. It's just all [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=782.5200000000001s)]
*  it's all uh [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=788.44s)]
*  Just the same old stuff from the media because that's an old one try finding something new [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=790.6s)]
*  Which is good [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=798.2s)]
*  Because pete is not a neocon. He's not a warhawk. He's not a chaos agent [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=799.32s)]
*  We live in one of the most dangerous times since the end of the cold war. There's just no doubt about it [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=804.2s)]
*  You've refined it [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=807.32s)]
*  But i've also i'm also the product of two decades of war in iraq and afghanistan [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=808.28s)]
*  Where my view shifted a great deal from where it was to where it is today because you would have to be a fool [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=811.72s)]
*  To look at the outcomes in iraq and afghanistan and think that what we got out of them [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=819.16s)]
*  Was beneficial to american national security interests and that's not to take away from every vet who gave everything [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=825.0s)]
*  I was one of them those last vet those last folks in afghanistan the 13 [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=830.44s)]
*  We lost the people who fought for the places that isis took back like that investment that fight that mission is real [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=834.52s)]
*  And I love all of it [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=839.88s)]
*  But we have to be realists and clear-eyed about what that intervention meant [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=841.32s)]
*  The finite resources that we have the debt that we have the threats that we have the responsibilities our allies have to show in europe [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=845.5600000000001s)]
*  If they want to defend that continent the reality of the outcome in ukraine. Donald trump's been very clear about that [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=853.5600000000001s)]
*  But that he wants to end it [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=859.88s)]
*  Right away. He's a war fighter who has helped already the army navy and air force get on track for record recruiting years [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=861.88s)]
*  Who is eliminating woke from our armed forces who is restoring lethality to our military by making sure standards are uniformly high [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=868.84s)]
*  and much much more [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=875.0s)]
*  So here to help unpack some of this republican on republican violence is steve bannon host of bannon's war room [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=876.6800000000001s)]

*  Our ancestors had the answer all along bitter foods [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=909.88s)]
*  Bitter herbs and plants have been used for centuries to stimulate digestion support detoxification and keep the gut thriving [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=914.28s)]

*  Well, you know having worked in the pentagon after I came off sea duty back the first day that president reagan [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=958.28s)]
*  Uh came I was there for I don't know three three and a half almost four years [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=965.24s)]
*  There's one thing about controlling that building [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=969.8s)]
*  Uh, and another thing about being president trump's senior national security advisor for uh for the military [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=972.28s)]
*  I think this goes back [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=979.08s)]
*  And I think caldwell people got to watch that tucker interview [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=981.0s)]
*  Uh, I think there's some deep and disturbing truths in that [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=985.4000000000001s)]
*  This is I and I think the leaks and all this stuff is is is the they're wanting us to chase [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=990.2800000000001s)]
*  rabbits here the core of this to me gets down to [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=997.72s)]
*  You said republican or republican megan [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1001.5600000000001s)]
*  I think it's almost even deeper in this this is about the america first national security policy and about [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1004.44s)]
*  How we've had been a neoliberal neocon [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1009.96s)]
*  Uh country for 40 or 50 years [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1013.48s)]
*  This gets down to I believe this whole strategy in the middle east and and people like caldwell who came from the coax defense priority [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1016.84s)]
*  Which essentially also made pete and transformed pete and years ago. They were looking to do that transform him from a [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1024.6s)]
*  fox news host to someone who could go into senior levels of national security by giving him some of these veterans groups and others that [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1032.28s)]
*  Would promote him something over and above just a media figure [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1039.64s)]
*  Uh, I think it shouldn't be lost in anybody that this comes up and and I say this [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1043.3200000000002s)]
*  with total respect for tucker who I respect and I I [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1048.76s)]
*  Consider a friend and a colleague [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1052.44s)]
*  Um that uh, you know what our show and and and our part of the maga base [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1054.76s)]
*  We're quite or at least at least two-thirds of our audience 80 percent are very pro israel in the defense, but we're very anti [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1059.48s)]
*  Uh any type of a military conflict with persia about these nuclear sites [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1066.92s)]
*  I think this comes down to a fundamental break break between between the defense priority guys and [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1073.0s)]
*  The coke organization which is much more isolationist much more bring it all home [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1079.48s)]
*  Versus people who are engaged want to understand we have to be engaged in the world [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1084.68s)]
*  We have to have a national security policy even around hemispheric defense [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1088.44s)]
*  That is forward-leaning, but we don't want to lead with military [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1092.2800000000002s)]
*  We want to lead with economic warfare and others and I think that's where this rift is [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1096.1200000000001s)]
*  It shouldn't be lost on in your story, which I thought was a brilliant, uh overview of this and bringing in all the elements [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1099.88s)]
*  You know bb netanyahu [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1105.4s)]
*  Has come here twice in the last four or five weeks one time president trump literally blew up the conversation with trump gaza [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1107.96s)]
*  Which kind of came out of nowhere and and because bb was here to pitch the united states [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1115.64s)]
*  being a part of an active part of a [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1121.24s)]
*  military support for at least an air assault maybe even a ground assault into persia to take down [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1124.2s)]
*  Their nuclear facilities, which would be catastrophic from a military view if you know what the damage assessment would be [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1130.44s)]
*  He came back, you know under the under the headline of tariffs [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1136.76s)]
*  But he was here to make a second pitch because president trump did not engage the first time [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1140.68s)]
*  And president trump basically told him in front of the world. Hey, by the way, we're starting negotiations [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1144.84s)]
*  101 with no no no participation of israel [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1149.42s)]
*  With the persians starting next week in oman and now it's going to continue again in rome [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1154.3s)]
*  Uh, you know this weekend [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1159.34s)]
*  With which i'm sure the president being there for the pope's uh, the pope's um funeral [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1161.66s)]
*  May even participate or have some sort of more direct involvement [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1167.66s)]
*  So I think this gets down to [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1171.26s)]
*  And I think we all get on the table it gets down to [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1173.26s)]
*  The situation with israel and people like tucker and curt mills and other brilliant people who I think the world of saying [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1175.74s)]
*  Hey for too long. We've had the tail wag the dog [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1182.38s)]
*  Right and president trump and others who are supporters of israel saying hey look [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1185.42s)]
*  This has to be part of an american national security policy [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1189.9s)]
*  And we have to have this and I don't totally agree with president trump about a piece of paper [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1193.98s)]
*  But it has to be something other than a military conflict. I don't think it's [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1198.54s)]
*  Lost on people that the pentagon has been accused under pete and with these guys of not having detailed [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1202.94s)]
*  plans and support [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1209.9s)]
*  Criteria ready to basically jump in here and have it they've they've kind of slow walked it [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1211.96s)]
*  And I think the reason they've slow walked it is that there is this [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1216.78s)]
*  President trump and he said again the other day in the in the in the press briefing the press avail on the oval [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1220.14s)]
*  Yeah, that he wants peace. He wants a peaceful way to settle this [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1225.1000000000001s)]
*  Uh, I don't like the ver and he's got his top guy witkopf on the negotiation this I don't like the v word [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1229.66s)]
*  I don't like verification. I think this has to be taken down piece by piece and I think we have to [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1235.5s)]
*  Rent go up the escalatory ladder on economic warfare. Number one. My question is why are we allowing? [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1242.54s)]
*  You know, they say 1.5 million [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1250.0600000000002s)]
*  But it's really almost two and a half million barrels of oil a day to leave iran that funds the mullahs [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1251.9s)]
*  Uh and goes through the straits of her moves [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1257.8200000000002s)]
*  Uh to uh through straits of malakha to china and it's 22 to 25 percent of china's [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1260.14s)]
*  Output of which oh by the way, we're engaged in an economic [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1266.14s)]
*  War right now. I think go up the escalatory ladder [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1269.9s)]
*  Which would say hey i've been in a carrier battle group [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1273.3400000000001s)]
*  You know off the coast of iran for the hostage crisis in the in the persian golf [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1276.7s)]
*  We've got two carrier battle groups right now in the red sea keeping the suez canal open just move one over [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1281.26s)]
*  You know over to in front of the straits of her moves and let's do a blockade [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1286.94s)]
*  A naval quarantine of everything and you'll the mullahs will be gone in 100 days now [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1290.86s)]
*  You're going up the escalatory ladder, but I think all of this in the pentagon [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1295.02s)]
*  Gets down to a major [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1298.62s)]
*  fissure [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1300.62s)]
*  On really our national security policy going forward and are we prepared to get sucked back into an open conflict in the middle east again? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1301.6599999999999s)]
*  I don't think you're wrong [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1309.74s)]
*  And I but I wonder who they're fighting [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1311.34s)]
*  I think they're fighting trump not pete, you know, pete is trump's [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1313.82s)]
*  Executor like pete will do what he is told to do and trump has had he hasn't been as non-interventionalist [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1318.9199999999998s)]
*  As that core strain of maga, right? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1326.3s)]
*  Like he bombed sulamani his rhetoric around iran has been a lot more bellicose than I think [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1328.62s)]
*  Some in the party would like to hear we do not want saber rattling [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1334.78s)]
*  Suggesting our boys are going to have to go fight a war against iran at all much less [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1338.52s)]
*  Than have to do it [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1343.34s)]
*  But I think what like my take on this story is my own opinion based on the facts as I just laid them out [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1345.02s)]
*  Is that probably there is a strong? [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1351.4199999999998s)]
*  Anti-interventionalist strain within the pentagon a lot of these, you know, and this guy uh caldwell's former military, too [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1354.52s)]
*  He fought, uh abroad and saw horrible things and I think a lot of those guys like pete [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1360.4599999999998s)]
*  Got to the place where they do not want us to be too trigger happy [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1365.8999999999999s)]
*  And so i'm not saying caldwell leaked the those top secret documents to [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1370.1399999999999s)]
*  uh mbc news [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1375.5s)]
*  But it certainly could have been him and it looks like the pentagon thinks it was him [[00:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1377.26s)]
*  And if he were to do it, why would he do it? Well, because those documents were about [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1380.3799999999999s)]
*  Possible war down in panama possible use of armed forces in the in panama [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1384.54s)]
*  It's possible there is a strain even within the pentagon. That's even more to just make it easy to understand dovish [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1388.9399999999998s)]
*  Than those in charge and certainly more dovish than trump [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1394.9399999999998s)]
*  I I I see your analysis and i'm a disagree and here's why I think there's not and this is but this is why the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1398.3s)]
*  Promotions under bush and obama and president trump the first time with madison these guys, you know [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1404.1399999999999s)]
*  We took we took down the caliphate [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1409.1799999999998s)]
*  But but remember the center gravity of u.s [[00:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1411.58s)]
*  Foreign policy in military in the defense contractors is big army big operations in sencom in the middle east [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1414.62s)]
*  It shouldn't be lost you on the chats when you do on the signal chat [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1421.1799999999998s)]
*  The one thing that jumps off the the page at you is president trump is not engaged with these guys in a real time basis [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1424.78s)]
*  Who is he talking to in a real time go back and look at the chats? [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1430.78s)]
*  They're kind of throwing up ideas and pete's getting them up to speed [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1433.82s)]
*  They're directly talking the combatant commander and sencom on the who t's thing president trump's engaged directly with the combatant commander right there [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1436.94s)]
*  Sencom sencom is the center of gravity. This is why [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1444.22s)]
*  Obama failed on the pivot to asia [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1447.8s)]
*  All the pivot just keep it simple for me keep it simple for me [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1450.6200000000001s)]
*  Why would somebody and again with all due respect again dan colwell who i wanna underscore is denying that he leaked anything [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1455.18s)]
*  But why would someone like that? [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1461.3400000000001s)]
*  leak the the [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1465.0200000000002s)]
*  Alleged war plans. I mean the the report was that trump had asked the pentagon to drop war plans against the panama against the panamanians [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1467.42s)]
*  Basically to retake the panama canal [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1474.14s)]
*  Why would they leak that is why because because the strategic endeavor of president trump is a hemispheric defense [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1476.54s)]
*  It's to get off the eurasian landmass in a direct military conflict. Look you look at nato [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1482.94s)]
*  You look at the gulf emirates in the middle east you look around to the straits of malak at the south [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1487.74s)]
*  China scene you look up to korea and japan around the rim of the eurasian landmass where we fought all the wars of the 20th [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1492.06s)]
*  Century you have america you have america in commercial relationships trade deals capital markets [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1497.6599999999999s)]
*  But it's underwritten by an american security guarantee. This is why we have a trillion dollar defense budget [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1503.1s)]
*  This is why the the kids the sons and daughters [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1508.54s)]
*  Of the deplorables on two carrier battle groups in the red sea to keep the suez canal open for europe [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1512.06s)]
*  What president trump has said in panama central this for the non-interventionists or at least to tone it down [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1518.06s)]
*  We're going to shift to a hemispheric defense and that hemispheric defense is going to go from the panama canal initially from the panama [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1523.4199999999998s)]
*  Canal which we're going to control to block the chinese and russian navy from meeting in caribbean all the way up to greenland [[00:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1530.06s)]
*  Where we're going to block this russian navy from coming through mermansk and archangel coming down [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1536.46s)]
*  Uh to to the north atlantic to basically put ballistic missile submarines [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1542.06s)]
*  Off off of new york so they can launch in the united states and fast attacks down off of narfik and all of our ports on the east [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1546.62s)]
*  Coast also you talk about canada and the arctic that's part of the hemispheric defense pete hexes first visit outside of panama [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1552.22s)]
*  Was to go to the three island chain hawaii guam in the philippines to talk about the vast pacific as that is the natural [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1560.1399999999999s)]
*  Defense of the united states president trump strategy and marco rubio's first trip as secretary of state was down to panama [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1567.74s)]
*  Go ahead keep going. Panama. Yes, and and and and hey the guys in the panama the defense contractors are smart people and they're tough [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1573.4199999999998s)]
*  They ran elon musk out of there in a second. He hasn't done anything about the pentagon [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1580.3s)]
*  These are the original gangsters, okay [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1585.1s)]
*  They're ogs and they said they go hang on the hemispheric defense [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1587.7399999999998s)]
*  Is the way you cut the defense budget down from a trillion dollars to 500 billion dollars and really defend america and then on [[00:26:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1591.02s)]
*  Expeditionary forces you can pick and choose wherever you go for that, but we're off [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1597.4799999999998s)]
*  Okay, but wait, but you got to help me because [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1607.1s)]
*  If that whole [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1609.5s)]
*  If that's what you were saying ended with and is was and dan caldwell is a neo con [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1610.9399999999998s)]
*  Who doesn't want that he wants he doesn't want to pent defense department budgets to be slashed [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1616.4599999999998s)]
*  He wants us to be more interventionist in in eurasia and he doesn't want us to be focused on panama [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1621.1s)]
*  Then it would make sense, but he's not he's he's aligned with tucker [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1626.86s)]
*  He's aligned with tucker, but that's the people turfing him out remember he's the one turfed out look [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1632.3s)]
*  I'm not a huge dan caldwell fan originally. He's okay [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1637.34s)]
*  He's one of these coke guys the defense priorities which are total isolationists and kind of support at what I would call hemispheric defense [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1640.3s)]
*  The reason he was turfed out and they leaked they leaked [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1647.58s)]
*  Uh the um alleged and i'm not so sure he leaked it allegedly leaked but the the panama war plans [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1650.4599999999998s)]
*  I'm, not so sure he actually leaked them [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1655.98s)]
*  We'll have to find that over time is they're trying to get rid of the tucker the people more aligned with tucker [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1657.82s)]
*  Carlson the defense priority guys who pete really came from that area. That's why pete's sitting there going [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1663.34s)]
*  You know, it's his chief of staff these other guys [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1668.22s)]
*  It it looks like the building's coming after pete. I think this comes down [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1670.7s)]
*  Fundamentally where your audience ought to think of there's two separate ways [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1674.76s)]
*  You look at american national security in the 21st century president trump is presenting [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1678.14s)]
*  A radical but a plan that goes back to our founders in the in the munroe doctrine and manifest destiny [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1683.82s)]
*  About you take care of the western hemisphere if you secure the western hemisphere with the vast pacific [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1690.14s)]
*  Which is as big as the eurasian landmass as a defense and you and you take care of the russian navy [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1695.8200000000002s)]
*  From the arctic and from greenland and from panama. You've basically hermetically sealed the united states [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1701.74s)]
*  This is why he's also talking about a iron dome type thing or anti-ballistic missile once you've done that [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1706.8600000000001s)]
*  You've hermetically sealed the united states and probably had the potential of cutting our defense budget by half [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1713.26s)]
*  Okay, if you continue and and this is the plan of what the pentagon has is not sustainable [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1718.7s)]
*  If you continue this madness of us being everywhere and having troops everywhere and having you know from ukraine to the middle east to everywhere [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1723.8200000000002s)]
*  You're you're going to bankrupt the nation and I think that's the fundamental thing and you're seeing turmoil and pete [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1732.0600000000002s)]
*  Does not have control of the building. I'm a huge pete fan [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1737.1000000000001s)]
*  We we went fixed bayonets on pete when he was almost tossed over for ron de santos [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1739.66s)]
*  Very early in the confirmation phase so our our our audience is 100% in back of pete [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1745.26s)]
*  We want pete to stay but this gets to deeper and they're coming after trump. That's why this is the deep state [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1750.46s)]
*  Marco ruby today had a huge restructuring of the state department [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1756.3799999999999s)]
*  You're going to see and they leaked it on sunday with some false things the deep state was the national security council [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1759.66s)]
*  Whether it's at dni whether it's at cia state department or particularly the pentagon is trying to put a siege mentality on president trump [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1766.3s)]
*  That he can't take any actions. He wants to do to brace it [[00:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1773.98s)]
*  Basically implement megan the america first national security strategy and this is a live fire exercise [[00:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1777.5s)]
*  They're out for pete hexas and I think npr [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1783.66s)]
*  Is based on I think ron de santos is out there telling people you should have picked me at first that who's you going to trade out? [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1786.8600000000001s)]
*  Pete on i'm in the bullpen. I'm ready to go and the republican establishment would love that [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1793.02s)]
*  Oh, wow, there's a there is something coming in from left field that is is ron de santos the source [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1799.18s)]
*  That npr is basing it's they're out looking for others because eric ericson a conservative commentator was oliver x last night saying [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1805.4199999999998s)]
*  He's hearing it too from white house staffers [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1811.82s)]
*  I'm being assured it's not true [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1814.78s)]
*  And trump himself on camera yesterday saying it's not true with with no wiggle room [[00:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1817.34s)]
*  You know trump knows how to leave himself a little wiggle room, but he gave a full throated endorsement of pete [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1821.18s)]
*  I I remain confused. I don't I still don't get it. Caldwell's the leaker of the [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1826.14s)]
*  panama canal attack plan news [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1830.94s)]
*  That would be something that would be done by someone who is I think extremely dovish which [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1834.5400000000002s)]
*  He sounds like he is but he in that interview with tuckers sounded more [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1840.0600000000002s)]
*  Pro protecting panama canal than getting involved in iran [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1844.38s)]
*  So it doesn't make sense to me that he's the leaker to nbc and that's a point in his favor [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1848.46s)]
*  In any event, we'll find out eventually because we're going to know they unfortunately for leaders today [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1853.1799999999998s)]
*  I think I think I think your summary was brilliant [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1857.5s)]
*  And I think your summary is brilliant [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1859.8999999999999s)]
*  And I think folks really ought to focus on this because it gets to if you see [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1861.34s)]
*  The way they're coming at president trump to the judiciary and the courts the deep state and this is my problem [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1865.5s)]
*  When I hear pete talking about we're going to have an investigation and light all this and we're going to put it to doj [[00:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1871.26s)]
*  Hey, this thing right now in doj should be number 20 [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1876.2199999999998s)]
*  I mean people have to wake up. We have to have a sense of urgency right now. We are burning daylight [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1879.8200000000002s)]
*  We're 18 months away or however long away from the midterm elections [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1885.3400000000001s)]
*  Where if if if they raise two billion dollars and flip a couple of seats in new york and california [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1888.38s)]
*  Hakeem jeffries is going to speak at the house. They're going to impeach trump in the first weeks [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1893.9s)]
*  Of uh of not going to remove him but impeaching we're going to get to this whole thing again [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1897.66s)]
*  And people are not at doj at fbi and others are not moving quickly enough and fast enough with a sense of urgency [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1901.9s)]
*  And even cia and dni of taking down the deep state these people are at war with president trump [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1909.26s)]
*  What's happening to pete hexas is part of that war and we have to stop it by direct action [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1914.94s)]
*  You just can't sit there and wish it away and don't think that the election in november means anything to these people [[00:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1920.06s)]
*  They're dug in now more than ever and understand they need to get rid of trump and they need to get rid of trumpism [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1925.5s)]
*  Mm-hmm. That's exactly right. They'd be thrilled to get pete hexa scalp [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1931.9s)]
*  Uh, they couldn't care less. They don't they don't think there's chaos. They don't think they don't care about any of that [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1936.0600000000002s)]
*  They just want to scalp anyone on team trump will do sec. Def would be brilliant in their minds [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1940.78s)]
*  That's all they care about and I think trump should stand by him and not show them that he'll roll over [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1946.14s)]
*  based on [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1951.98s)]
*  Politico and npr which doesn't sound like trump to me. I think he will stand by him [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1953.1000000000001s)]
*  And by the way, we'll hear more. This is not going to be it. They're not done with pete, especially these guys who are now [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1957.5800000000002s)]
*  Obviously going to be pretty bitter that they got fired [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1963.26s)]
*  I'm sure we'll see more so trump's going to have to be steely spying on pete as he has been from the beginning [[00:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1965.82s)]
*  All right. Let's talk about what the democrats have done [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1970.6999999999998s)]
*  I mean if you if trump had like [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1973.8999999999999s)]
*  Drawn it up in a like dark cigar [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1976.1399999999999s)]
*  Smoke filled room. He couldn't have done much better than to get all these democrats running down to embrace this ms 13 gang member [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1978.9399999999998s)]
*  wife beater abrigo garcia, but they're doing it the best video I saw online was um, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1984.86s)]
*  Someone did use ai to show chris van hollen senator van hollen of maryland dancing with the ms 13 guy abrigo garcia in [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1990.3s)]
*  Like a waltz together [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=1998.3799999999999s)]
*  Sometimes ai is used for good, but they're running down there to embrace him steve and while [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2000.86s)]
*  We don't know what's going to happen on the legal battle for trump. He's had a setback with the supreme court this past weekend [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2006.62s)]
*  pr wise [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2012.76s)]
*  Politically, he's winning this isn't he? [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2014.36s)]
*  He's winning it but i'm going to say it's a quite brilliant strategy [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2016.54s)]
*  I think they're doing because this is not about the criminal gangs clearly [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2020.06s)]
*  They're embracing these people and the american people are 80 20 against that but their overall strategic goal is not is no mass deportations [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2023.5s)]
*  Under biden's watch we have at least 10 million illegal alien invaders here [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2031.74s)]
*  If I was running their operations, I kind of do the same thing is delay and deny block trump on the most egregious [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2036.54s)]
*  If they can slow us down megan on ms and ms 13 if they can slow us down with the venison whaling gang if they can do that [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2042.54s)]
*  When do we actually get to the mass deportations and here's what happens on the deep state you you talk about exactly first of you [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2048.54s)]
*  We'll wear him down. We'll change the public. You know the wall street guys come I said we need these guys for the economy [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2055.2599999999998s)]
*  They had two percent of gdp that the wages are low because of this [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2059.74s)]
*  They're they are most focused on the 10 million because they want to make sure that they're not going to be able to do that [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2063.82s)]
*  They are most focused on the 10 million because they want them here as essentially indentured servants, but also as voters [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2069.26s)]
*  That's why you gotta keep the eye on the prize and honestly they've slowed us down [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2076.5400000000004s)]
*  They use the courts, but let's talk about what happened in the courts [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2080.38s)]
*  President trump used the alien alien enemies act of 1798 [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2083.5s)]
*  One of the predicates of that is actually make the case for an invasion by a foreign power and using these gangs [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2089.1800000000003s)]
*  The deep state came out over the weekend with a national uh, [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2094.62s)]
*  Intelligence estimate kind of leaked to the press to say hey the community, you know over at dni [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2097.9s)]
*  They're doing this internal analysis and it doesn't support that at all. This is what's happening [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2103.42s)]
*  I think the democrats are playing their cards smartly although for most people they're sitting there going [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2108.38s)]
*  How can they embrace these guys? [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2113.34s)]
*  They're embracing these the worst of the worst to slow us down and getting the worst of the worst out [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2114.86s)]
*  Now they got us jammed up in court [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2120.1400000000003s)]
*  They got president trump's the energy the attention and nobody's talking about the mass deportations you wait to the the bill comes up [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2121.9s)]
*  uh for the the reconciliation where we're asking for 170 [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2129.02s)]
*  Billion dollars to rebuild the infrastructure the ice and the logistics to get people out of here. That's going to be another firestorm [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2133.32s)]
*  So I think we got to double and triple down. Uh, you're a lawyer. I'm not I think there's [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2139.9s)]
*  president lincoln [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2145.5800000000004s)]
*  Uh, you know, uh held up a habeas corpus in the civil war general washington was all for it and a couple of times [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2147.18s)]
*  You know after he became president about the situation we have the french revolution and some of the french people over here [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2154.62s)]
*  I think you've got to get much more on everything we're doing on taking down the deep state and going after this aspect of it [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2160.38s)]
*  I think we have to double and triple down now [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2167.2599999999998s)]
*  There can't be any retreat and no pushback and quite frankly the courts have got us jammed up [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2169.5s)]
*  And I think we got to look at other [[00:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2174.2999999999997s)]
*  Alternative methods and I think there's got to be a challenge [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2176.44s)]
*  There is a constitutional crisis right now [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2179.02s)]
*  My point is go maximalist on this and let's bring it to a head and let's bring it now so we can get to the mass deportations [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2181.42s)]
*  Otherwise the democrats are going to win [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2187.7400000000002s)]
*  Yes, I totally agree with that. We talked about the numbers just the other day [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2190.6200000000003s)]
*  Uh, you know, they were 10 and a half million before joe biden took over in this country [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2194.54s)]
*  And now you've got the center for migrant studies saying well now they estimate it's about 11.7 [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2199.42s)]
*  A way more than a million came in under joe biden [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2203.1s)]
*  In fact cpb estimates. It's more like 8.2 million. So now you're talking [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2206.54s)]
*  You know to round up 20 million illegals here 500 000 of which a little less are said to be also [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2211.02s)]
*  Extra criminals, you know, you're you're a criminal if you came in here illegally, but then committed other crimes and that's what he's starting with [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2217.66s)]
*  So they've been doing a good job of stopping it legally. But how can trump I mean trump could in the abrigo garcia case? [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2224.38s)]
*  Um, literally under the best totally [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2230.46s)]
*  um [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2234.62s)]
*  What's the opposite of the straw man stone manning strong manning the other side's argument? [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2235.42s)]
*  I'm a strong man the other side's argument the absolute best they can argue about abrigo garcia is that [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2239.42s)]
*  He's entitled to be flown back to the united states brought in front of an immigration judge who can then say [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2245.1s)]
*  that gang you were fearing in el salvador is no longer therefore the [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2250.54s)]
*  Uh suspension of removal to el salvador is lifted and now you have to go back home and then we fly him home [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2255.6600000000003s)]
*  That is literally the best case scenario for abrigo garcia right now [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2261.1800000000003s)]
*  And this is all this time and u.s senators and energy expended on this one man's case [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2267.02s)]
*  Forget the fact that he's a gang member allegedly forget the fact that he's a white people wife beater [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2272.6200000000003s)]
*  It's all interesting but it's irrelevant legally all you have to prove is that he was here illegally and deported which he was [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2276.46s)]
*  He was all that happened except the court said but not to el salvador because he's convinced me [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2282.3s)]
*  He's going to get killed if he gets sent back there [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2287.34s)]
*  So all we'd have to do is fly back here have a little hearing where they said [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2289.5s)]
*  You know what that threat is no longer existent. You're going back home to el salvador [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2292.54s)]
*  Done, but the reason they won't do it is what you just said because you do that for the one [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2296.2200000000003s)]
*  They've won the aclu has won [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2301.9s)]
*  We're if we do that if we're and I don't like the fact he's been transferred from ccot [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2305.82s)]
*  I don't like the direction of this so far [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2310.2999999999997s)]
*  This is the worst of the worst and look how the media has embraced this and made this guy a hero [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2312.8599999999997s)]
*  The reason is it's about due process if in their concept of these invaders if we bring him back for that hearing [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2317.1s)]
*  It's over. It's over. It's over for the sovereignty of the country. It's over for the country [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2325.18s)]
*  You're never going to get to the rest of the criminal gangs president trump [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2329.8199999999997s)]
*  I think came out on true social day. Megan. Look, you know this a thousand times better than I do [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2332.7s)]
*  I think he said the calculation that the ice guys have done is 200 years [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2336.7799999999997s)]
*  You'd have 200 200 years to even get to the criminals not even to the 10 million just the due process [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2341.02s)]
*  Hearings, you would have to have an over and over again [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2347.3399999999997s)]
*  So I think we have to take a hard line on this. I think stephen miller is 100 correct [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2349.74s)]
*  I think we have to take a hard line and I would like further action. I just think now's the time to do it [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2353.58s)]
*  I do believe and I think [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2359.02s)]
*  Look the the supreme court to come out at one o'clock in the morning in the dark at night over [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2361.02s)]
*  over [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2366.3s)]
*  Uh easter weekend and put out a ruling and then have justice alito put out his opinion what was blistering? [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2367.1000000000004s)]
*  To his colleagues we have now this thing's up at the supreme court and there's a civil war in the supreme court [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2374.3s)]
*  On the conservative side not even talking about the the progressive judges that we've allowed and these guys are now feeling empowered [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2380.6200000000003s)]
*  You're going to have lawsuits on tariffs going lawsuits on every action president trump's going to do [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2387.6600000000003s)]
*  To delay is to deny and they're playing it masterfully [[00:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2392.2200000000003s)]
*  The the justice department is overwhelmed because you only have so many lawyers. Yes [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2396.38s)]
*  This is we have to lance the boil on this [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2400.38s)]
*  Otherwise the legal insurrection of these neo-marxist judges is is going to win just by overwhelming us [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2403.7400000000002s)]
*  And that's why I think it's more and more direct and tough action [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2410.2200000000003s)]
*  I just don't think anybody is account other than the trump administration [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2414.86s)]
*  But none of these courts and we're not effectively making the point I guess enough to the judges or the appellate court judges or the [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2417.66s)]
*  supreme court that [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2423.1s)]
*  Every single one of these came into this country without affording anybody any due process [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2425.2599999999998s)]
*  No hearing was held to allow them. No application was filed to allow them. They just broke our laws [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2429.42s)]
*  Why can't we just afford them commensurate due process with that? [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2435.34s)]
*  They afforded us in coming into the country. Shouldn't it be a quid pro quo? It should be it should be a match [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2438.86s)]
*  If you fill out forms and we said you can stay here now [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2443.98s)]
*  We're trying to deport you you get your full hearing but if you broke our laws to come here [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2447.02s)]
*  Why do you deserve anything before we get you out of here? [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2450.54s)]
*  Megan you're arguing [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2453.58s)]
*  Law constitutional law you're arguing logic in the rule of law. This is that's what i'm saying [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2455.74s)]
*  This is not about that. You can make all those arguments and they don't care boseburg [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2460.7s)]
*  Look on the unitary theory of the executive where president trump's it's president boseburg to use deep. Please show some respect [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2464.46s)]
*  No, but this is my point he stepped in the middle of this of president trump's primary responsibility being commander in chief [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2471.5s)]
*  Of the armed forces and being commander in chief and taking an oath to god about the national security [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2478.06s)]
*  Of the united states he stepped in the middle of it and now is bringing criminal is setting up a record of criminal contempt [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2482.7799999999997s)]
*  Charges of which as you remember I went to prison [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2488.86s)]
*  They're trying to do the exact same thing around people around president trump. This is so obvious this gets back to the pentagon [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2491.9s)]
*  Folks you have to understand this deep state. This just didn't occur overnight. This has been 40 or 50 years [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2498.7s)]
*  All those generals and field officers and civilians have been around forever as part of the deep state of the pentagon [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2504.14s)]
*  They're just not going to have pete hexes come in with president trump's ideas a handful of people and say oh, this is terrific [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2510.46s)]
*  Why didn't we think of this the same way the judiciary? [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2516.14s)]
*  Look at the radical nature of these judges. You're the lawyer. You're a constitutional lawyer [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2519.58s)]
*  You know how outrageous some of this has been it's [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2524.06s)]
*  Post-constitutional that's what the american people and particularly maga has to wake up [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2527.96s)]
*  I think even more to and say hey look [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2532.46s)]
*  We're not playing by the old rules here anymore because they're going to bury president trump in that way [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2534.6200000000003s)]
*  And that's why I think we have to be even more aggressive and more outside the box [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2538.78s)]
*  And I think this legal insurrection [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2542.78s)]
*  And you see this at the supreme court of the united states to file something in the middle of the night at one o'clock in the morning [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2544.78s)]
*  And then have alito so furious that he puts out his own opinion [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2550.7799999999997s)]
*  Which throws a couple of sharp elbows at people his colleagues and the colleagues he was throwing a sharp elbow at was [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2555.3399999999997s)]
*  That's the chief justice of the supreme court roberts, right? So and and not a single trump justice [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2561.18s)]
*  Voted to stop it either not one of the trump justices voted [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2567.74s)]
*  It's not that they're obligated to vote on his side [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2571.3399999999997s)]
*  It's just if you are a conservative justice and you're you're opposing both alito and thomas you've done something wrong [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2573.58s)]
*  Um, okay, i've got to get your reaction to [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2579.98s)]
*  leticia james [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2583.08s)]
*  Finding herself on the wrong side of the law allegedly [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2585.18s)]
*  Uh, the audience probably remembers we reported this late last week [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2589.98s)]
*  But now she's been referred to the doj by uh this housing investigator for having allegedly filled out [[00:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2592.78s)]
*  fraudulent forms and getting two different mortgages one out of virginia [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2600.36s)]
*  Which she claimed reportedly as her primary residence [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2605.42s)]
*  Even though her primary residence is in new york where she's attorney general and one out of new york where she claimed [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2608.3s)]
*  Allegedly for mortgage break purposes that it was a dwelling that didn't have more than four apartments when in fact it has five [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2615.1000000000004s)]
*  And she would have had to pay more in a mortgage if she had been honest and then he also alleged [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2621.82s)]
*  Uh that back in 1990 [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2627.5800000000004s)]
*  1983 she applied for a mortgage with her father claiming the two of them were husband and wife [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2629.98s)]
*  Allegedly as part of a scheme just to show she has a long history [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2635.7999999999997s)]
*  Of playing fast and loose with the facts in applying for mortgages meaning [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2639.34s)]
*  She thinks she's entitled to do something that the rest of us are not so she finally spoke out to this [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2642.38s)]
*  On thursday and here is what she said on new york spectrum one [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2647.58s)]
*  Let me just say to all new yorkers and to all americans the allegations are baseless [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2652.7799999999997s)]
*  The allegations are nothing more than a revenge tour. No as any good attorney [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2658.64s)]
*  I will not litigate this case on in a camera [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2664.48s)]
*  um [[00:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2668.08s)]
*  It's important that we will respond to these allegations at the appropriate time [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2669.2s)]
*  Um and in the an appropriate way [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2675.68s)]
*  Now she doesn't want to litigate cases on camera steve [[00:44:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2680.3999999999996s)]
*  Uh [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2684.08s)]
*  If those facts are the case, I hope the doj in the southern district of new york [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2686.16s)]
*  Uh are moving rapidly to an panel do a quick investigation panel and grand jury and let's get on with it [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2691.04s)]
*  This is another thing about let's just move off and it looks pretty straightforward right on the facts have been presented. She's presented no [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2696.64s)]
*  No counter facts about this. It looks pretty egregious [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2704.08s)]
*  And I think it was done at the same time that she was dropping these charges these phony charges on president trump [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2707.44s)]
*  So what's good for the goose is is better for the gander [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2713.2799999999997s)]
*  I would say let's get on it and get on it quickly [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2716.24s)]
*  This is what i'm saying about we got to have a sense of urgency [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2718.56s)]
*  I would hope we would be seeing if the facts are the case and you have to have investigation [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2721.52s)]
*  You would be seeing an indictment pretty quickly [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2726.24s)]
*  And uh, and let's perp walker into uh into federal court and uh, right on see she says she's not going to do it [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2728.88s)]
*  She's not going to do it on tv. That's fine. We'll do it in a court of law, but get on with it [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2734.7999999999997s)]

*  Dispirited and doesn't have you know any way forward and really has no policies. She's out there as a dynamic personality [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2865.44s)]
*  She's putting some energy into what first the number one is you've got to get people to kind of believe in something [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=2872.56s)]

*  Listen to this [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3586.12s)]
*  When the then medical examiner dr marlin osborne first got ellen's body [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3587.56s)]
*  He ruled it a homicide [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3593.72s)]
*  Of course, she stabbed 20 times including 10 stab wounds to the back even slicing her dura [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3596.36s)]
*  The protective sheath around the spine yet. She kept stabbing herself 20 times [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3603.32s)]
*  So naturally he said this is a homicide [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3608.84s)]
*  Wait for it [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3611.96s)]
*  Then because police had already said oh, yeah [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3613.32s)]

*  They never divulged what happened [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3653.4s)]
*  He comes out and goes change my mind oopsie [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3655.6400000000003s)]
*  And rules it a suicide [[01:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3658.76s)]

*  The parents of ellen greenberg [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3662.5200000000004s)]

*  Why suicide? [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3682.04s)]
*  They spent all their life savings. They just sold their house megan [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3683.7200000000003s)]
*  To try to get her name cleared that she did not commit suicide [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3688.2000000000003s)]
*  So they sue the city the cops they throw the book they sue them civilly [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3692.52s)]
*  They're picking the jury and the emmy is going to have to take the stand and divulge what happened in that closed door meeting [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3698.44s)]
*  Why he changed his ruling? [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3704.6s)]
*  Last minute 11th hour they settled the case rather than tell the truth [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3706.6s)]
*  He settles the case [[01:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3712.52s)]
*  Where does that leave the case? [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3714.2s)]
*  pending [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3716.2599999999998s)]
*  And i'm telling you [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3717.3199999999997s)]
*  Josh chapiro the now governor and you know how I hate to talk about politics because I don't want the crimes I report and investigate [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3719.0s)]
*  To be any swayed by politics [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3725.4s)]
*  Josh chapiro was the state ag at the time. He was begged. Look at this. He's like I don't see any evidence [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3728.92s)]
*  I agree with the police. How could he say that he was this close to the oval office? [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3736.84s)]
*  Until the name ellen greenberg popped up in the media and suddenly he was off the roster of potential vp candidates [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3742.04s)]
*  That's right. That's how controversial this office and now he's the governor [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3750.2799999999997s)]
*  So one of the there's so many like really interesting facts connected with this [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3754.76s)]
*  one of the damning facts against [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3760.2s)]
*  sam goldberg who is you know [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3763.32s)]
*  obviously [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3765.94s)]
*  Suspected by some as having killed her he denies it forcefully and is disgusted that that's been alleged and has a strong statement [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3767.16s)]
*  About mental health and how people don't understand it [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3775.0s)]
*  But we're going to consider him because obviously that's that's what many people including ellen's family think happened that he killed her [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3777.48s)]
*  But one of the things that is not a good fact for him is he did while [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3785.7200000000003s)]
*  I think while outside the apartment trying to get in or let's at least during the period [[01:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3791.48s)]
*  He says he was out there trying to get in [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3796.28s)]
*  He made two phone calls or he made a phone call to a cousin who happens to be a lawyer [[01:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3798.04s)]
*  And that cousin's father who's a lawyer? [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3803.4s)]
*  Called him back [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3806.76s)]
*  So nancy that jumped out at me is like why if your fiance is outside of apartment in which you know, you're non-responsive [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3808.6s)]
*  Why would he be calling a lawyer? Can you explain what happened there? [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3816.12s)]
*  Well [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3821.7200000000003s)]
*  That jumped out at me as well [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3822.84s)]
*  however [[01:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3824.76s)]
*  I will say that at this juncture [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3826.2s)]
*  When there hasn't even been [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3829.08s)]
*  a real investigation [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3831.64s)]
*  No luminal was used I would like to point out that no fingerprints were taken [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3834.04s)]
*  Her blood was smeared along the kitchen cabinets she was found [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3842.04s)]
*  Sitting up in the kitchen floor legs in the kitchen floor back against the cabinets [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3847.64s)]
*  And there was blood smeared behind her [[01:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3853.96s)]
*  As if she had been slammed against the cabinets and then land landed where she was sitting [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3857.0s)]
*  This is devastating to the investigation. There's something called that we call the wrong way blood [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3864.04s)]
*  When fire and pd got there [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3873.0s)]
*  Blood was dried megan. She's sitting up [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3876.44s)]
*  Going horizontally across her face [[01:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3880.6s)]
*  Impossible if you believe in sir isaac newton findings and gravity the blood would have gone like that [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3884.12s)]
*  Right straight down it was dried this way which proves at some point [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3890.12s)]
*  She had been lying that way for the blood to dry [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3895.24s)]
*  And then propped up which is staging of the same [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3898.8399999999997s)]
*  What i'm saying right now all I want [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3903.24s)]
*  Is an independent investigation. I'm not ready to point a finger at anybody [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3906.4399999999996s)]
*  Nobody. Yeah, sure. I can speculate [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3911.64s)]
*  But I believe that that would hurt the investigation [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3914.2s)]
*  Because what if down the line is somebody else? [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3917.8199999999997s)]
*  And the state will be haunted by speculation [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3921.5s)]
*  So I think what we need right now is this case to be reopened for an independent investigation [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3925.66s)]
*  You just touch the tip of the iceberg. There's the wrong way blood there are signs of strangulation [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3932.38s)]
*  You and I discussed the criminal statistics the method and assessment of homicide and suicide. It is highly unlikely [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3939.58s)]
*  a [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3947.5s)]
*  for a female to kill herself [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3948.38s)]
*  And destroy anything around the face and the head she might poison herself. She might od [[01:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3952.14s)]
*  She might jump out a window. She might use carbon monoxide, you know in a car or an oven gas [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3957.74s)]
*  But it's highly unlikely. She would stab herself now in the rare event a female does stab herself clothing right? [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3963.3399999999997s)]
*  It wouldn't be 20 times [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3971.18s)]
*  When the fire department got there megan [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3973.42s)]
*  They said she would have to be double or triple jointed to stab herself in the back that many times in the back [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3976.6200000000003s)]
*  And here is the coup de gras [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3984.3s)]
*  Here's the topper. I hope you're sitting down. You may need to lay down megan to hear this. Oh boy [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3987.1800000000003s)]
*  Some of the wounds according to experts not me [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3992.78s)]
*  experts medical examiners death investigators [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=3997.1800000000003s)]
*  At least one if not more wounds [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4000.78s)]
*  were administered [[01:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4003.7400000000002s)]
*  post-mortem [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4005.82s)]
*  After death after her heart stopped beating why they did not bleed [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4007.34s)]
*  If you're dead and you're lying there and I stab you it's not going to bleed because your heart's not pumping blood anymore [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4013.5800000000004s)]
*  At least one if not two wounds were post-mortem megan. It's impossible for this to be suicide now [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4021.26s)]
*  I do not [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4029.42s)]
*  impugn [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4031.42s)]
*  Perjury or nefarious intent on anyone? [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4032.46s)]
*  yet [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4036.46s)]
*  I believe the cops got there [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4037.82s)]
*  they [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4040.38s)]
*  believed they just [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4041.5s)]
*  Ate the story they were told that the door was broken in and maybe it was I don't know the answer to that yet [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4043.34s)]
*  I do know by breaking in a door you destroy evidence if the door was locked or unlocked because the door is now broken down [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4051.7400000000002s)]
*  But they said when they got there [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4059.5s)]
*  That something was wrong when they first got there, but they didn't use luminol [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4062.54s)]
*  They didn't make any measurements [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4068.54s)]
*  I have found out that on the bottom of her shoes megan was covered in blood [[01:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4070.86s)]
*  If she killed herself, what why would that be? [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4076.86s)]
*  I found that clumps of her hair [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4080.06s)]
*  Covered in blood were between her legs where she was sitting according to a rep for the family [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4082.7s)]
*  None of this equals suicide [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4089.18s)]
*  I think the cops did a shabby job [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4091.66s)]
*  the very next day [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4094.46s)]
*  The apartment manager was asked if the fiance's family could come get items for the funeral [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4096.38s)]
*  She called the police and asked them can they and they went sure [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4102.78s)]
*  And she said well, can I clean the apartment so it can be rented out again? [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4106.54s)]
*  And they went sure and they even gave her a cleaning a crime cleaning specialist [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4109.9s)]
*  She sensed something was wrong [[01:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4115.98s)]
*  And she videoed the apartment before and after the cleaning which is [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4118.54s)]
*  Kind of a way to preserve evidence and guess what the police lost the video [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4124.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, you know [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4128.0599999999995s)]
*  What else could they possibly do wrong and I think in a bid to cover up their mistakes they started a lie [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4131.099999999999s)]
*  Let me let me [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4138.139999999999s)]
*  Take a take a stab at bad choice of words, but defending the suicide theory [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4139.5s)]
*  The people who believe it or who want us to believe it say [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4145.42s)]
*  She was on a couple of drugs a sleeping medication and an anti-anxiety med she was seeing a therapist [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4149.74s)]
*  She by the way, the therapist said she did not complain about the fiance at all [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4156.38s)]
*  they seem to have a loving relationship for what it's worth and she [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4159.58s)]
*  had these I guess commonly prescribed medications to help her sleep and to help with her anxiety and the [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4164.86s)]
*  Reported side effects. They always list the side effects and they they tend to include suicidality [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4170.219999999999s)]
*  You know 99.99 percent of the cases it they don't cause that but the drug manufacturers put it on there as one of the possible risks [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4175.98s)]
*  and so [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4183.5s)]
*  the theory is that [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4184.78s)]
*  Though you know, she she seemed happy and she seemed maybe a little anxious but net a happy person [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4186.54s)]
*  something flipped and [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4192.94s)]
*  Many of those wounds were superficial [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4195.9s)]
*  Like a testing which could happen with somebody who's like seeing what it would feel like and working up the nerve to actually do it [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4198.379999999999s)]
*  and there was some question about [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4205.5s)]
*  Whether I saw the testimony by that one expert saying yeah, those wounds didn't bleed and therefore they probably committed post-mortem [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4208.219999999999s)]
*  But then there was something on the other side saying she the same woman saying but I can't be totally sure on that either [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4215.0199999999995s)]
*  To be honest [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4220.54s)]
*  So that's the argument that she took her own life and of course that she was in a locked apartment by herself [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4221.82s)]
*  There was only one other way out [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4228.86s)]
*  There was that front door that was locked with a latch from the inside and there's only one other way out which was the [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4230.14s)]
*  The deck leading off their patio, but it was a snowstorm and the snow was totally preserved and unfootmarked at all [[01:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4234.94s)]
*  so the cops reasonably did not believe anybody had come in or gotten out from there, so [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4241.0199999999995s)]
*  It had to be didn't didn't have to be [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4246.62s)]
*  Her or her fiance [[01:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4249.42s)]
*  It doesn't have to be anything [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4256.0599999999995s)]
*  But I can tell you this [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4260.3s)]
*  It's not suicide. I will address each of the points you raised [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4262.46s)]
*  In order that you raised them number one [[01:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4266.7s)]
*  sleepy meds and [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4269.9s)]
*  anti-anxiety meds [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4271.96s)]
*  She had just seen her therapist why was she seeing a therapist she was seeing dr. Ellen Berman because [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4274.68s)]
*  Shortly before her murder [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4281.96s)]
*  She had called her parents josh and sandy and asked to move home [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4284.28s)]
*  To move out of the apartment she shared with her fiance [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4290.28s)]
*  Quit her job and move home. She was teaching first graders [[01:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4294.36s)]
*  She had always loved her job and indicated nothing. Otherwise [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4300.6s)]
*  Her father advised her whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, don't quit your job in the middle of the year [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4304.68s)]
*  Finish out the term [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4310.68s)]
*  And then if you want to then quit your job [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4312.84s)]
*  Why she wanted to move out of the apartment with sam remains a mystery. I don't know the answer to that [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4317.32s)]
*  But I do know that she asked her parents and one of her best friends debbie. Could she move in with them? [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4323.24s)]
*  Shortly before her death [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4331.4s)]
*  Her mother was like what's wrong? [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4333.639999999999s)]
*  Why why do you want to quit your job and move home with us? [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4336.2s)]
*  You know what before you do that before you leave your job [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4339.639999999999s)]
*  I want you to see a therapist i'll find you a counselor and she did dr. Ellen Berman [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4343.16s)]
*  Berman states specifically [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4348.679999999999s)]
*  That ellen had anxiety [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4351.799999999999s)]
*  But was not suicidal [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4354.839999999999s)]
*  Was not suicidal hence [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4358.04s)]
*  The prescription for anti-anxiety pills and sleep meds she was having trouble sleeping [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4361.72s)]
*  she [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4367.56s)]
*  Ellen spoke to friends [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4368.52s)]
*  Concerned about the effects of the [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4370.58s)]
*  anti-anxiety pill [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4374.34s)]
*  But what effect was she worried about gaining weight before her wedding? [[01:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4375.96s)]
*  That was her concern [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4381.16s)]
*  The autopsy revealed she had a normal amount of the meds in her there was no od [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4385.24s)]
*  I would also like to point out that the day of the murder there was a blizzard a nor'easter blew in [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4391.24s)]
*  Her first graders had to go home early [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4398.28s)]
*  Just before her death. It was questioned. Why was she calling all these people on her phone? Was she crazy? [[01:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4400.84s)]
*  The family [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4408.76s)]
*  Contacted all those numbers. She called every single student's family [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4410.36s)]
*  To make sure the child got home each child [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4415.4s)]
*  Those were the phone calls on her phone [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4419.08s)]
*  The people contacted the parents said she was absolutely fine. There was nothing wrong [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4421.639999999999s)]
*  So explain to me [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4426.44s)]
*  In the one hour before her murder [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4429.0s)]
*  She was on the phone making sure her children got home from school. She was perfectly happy and bubbly on the phone [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4431.8s)]
*  And the 45 minutes it took [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4439.719999999999s)]
*  For sam to go work out sam gulbert to go work out and come back [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4443.08s)]
*  That is not enough time. I don't I think a jury would agree for her to form the intent to commit suicide [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4447.0s)]
*  She was still in the kitchen where she was making a fruit salad for lunch [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4454.44s)]
*  And while she's supposed to be committing suicide with her right hand when she was found she still had [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4458.839999999999s)]
*  A pristine white dishcloth in her left hand [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4465.08s)]
*  so megan [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4468.599999999999s)]
*  You believe [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4470.839999999999s)]
*  In any world she could stab herself 20 times including to the back of the spine [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4472.92s)]
*  the top of the head [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4480.68s)]
*  And hold on the other hand with a clean dish towel, right? No, that did not happen [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4483.96s)]
*  The [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4495.08s)]
*  latching of the lock [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4496.68s)]
*  Is very interesting because was it the kind of [[01:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4499.08s)]
*  Lack lock that we all have in the hotel rooms, you know with a little chain or was it something more? [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4502.360000000001s)]
*  You know strong [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4507.64s)]
*  Not the chain. It was the kind that [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4509.56s)]
*  you [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4513.240000000001s)]
*  Pull over like that. Yep. Okay, and the person on the outside can open it like that much. It was one of those now [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4514.280000000001s)]
*  Tests have been done [[01:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4522.92s)]
*  That suggests the door was not broken in [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4524.68s)]
*  According to others the door was broken in but I stand firmly on the forensic evidence [[01:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4527.0s)]
*  the the door broken or not broken is [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4535.56s)]
*  another can of worms [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4539.24s)]
*  But just on the physical evidence alone and i'd like to point out [[01:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4540.92s)]
*  That in the last months the original medical examiner marlin osborne [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4546.04s)]
*  Turned [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4551.5s)]
*  Reversed and he says [[01:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4553.1s)]
*  This is not a suicide. I'm now convinced. It's not a suicide [[01:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4555.34s)]
*  so [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4559.34s)]
*  You and I and the rest of the world and all the online haters [[01:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4560.3s)]
*  Can hash it apart as much as we want to but the me that saw the body and multiple other emmys [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4564.3s)]
*  And medical examiner state it was not suicide. So [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4571.58s)]
*  The original problem was from marlin osborne [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4575.5s)]
*  Who after his closed door meeting where the da got immunity changed it to suicide he's reversed [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4578.64s)]
*  Everyone is in agreement now. It's not suicide. So why is nothing being done? [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4584.8s)]
*  Why aren't we looking for a killer? Can I see a question about the fiance? [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4589.92s)]
*  When he was because he says he went down to work out he came back up [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4595.6s)]
*  The apartment door is latched and he's you know saying hey, you know, he's sending her an increasingly [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4599.44s)]
*  Annoyed series of texts [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4606.18s)]
*  Inside and then he says he went down to the doorman and said hey i'm locked out [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4608.18s)]
*  She's got the latch closed and he claims the doorman was like kind of like not my problem [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4613.54s)]
*  You're gonna have to break it in if that's what you want if you want to enter and that that's what he then did [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4618.18s)]
*  Went up there and and pushed up push it open with his shoulder or his body [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4623.46s)]
*  Does does anybody verify any of that nancy does the doorman back that up? [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4627.9400000000005s)]
*  Did anybody witness the fact that he was locked out and pacing and trying to figure out what to do for [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4631.86s)]
*  That period of time maybe like a 30 minute window after workout and before finding her [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4636.9s)]
*  Well according to some reports [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4644.74s)]
*  Uh, the the doorman is philip hanton [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4647.3s)]
*  and um [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4650.98s)]
*  He says the fiance came down [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4652.9s)]
*  And told him he needed to break in the door [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4656.179999999999s)]
*  And hanton said I cannot leave this front desk [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4659.22s)]
*  I'm in charge of this and I can't go up there and i'm not going up there [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4662.9800000000005s)]
*  Now according to some reports the fiance said he did have a witness that watched him break down the door [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4667.54s)]
*  And suggested it was philip hanton. It wasn't philip hanton [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4674.82s)]
*  And as of now we have not uncovered [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4678.9800000000005s)]
*  any employee [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4683.06s)]
*  Or anyone that went with him [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4685.14s)]
*  To watch him break down the door [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4688.02s)]
*  Hmm, and do we have evidence that he did in fact go work out is that in dispute? [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4690.66s)]
*  I've seen the video of him going [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4696.74s)]
*  into the workout club it's downstairs like a workout room and [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4699.7s)]
*  According to the greenbergs rep coming out [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4704.900000000001s)]
*  In about 45 minutes. I've looked very carefully at him walking around because he then goes and gets [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4709.06s)]
*  Some mail and he's looking at his phone it looks to me [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4715.54s)]
*  That there is sweat on the back of his shirt [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4720.9s)]
*  But I can't tell from the black and white video [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4723.86s)]
*  But I can look at the timing he goes into the workout room and then comes out [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4726.26s)]
*  That much I do know [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4733.46s)]
*  And then so he comes home finds her she wasn't supposed to come home early that day, but she did because of the blizzard [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4735.38s)]
*  He's there he goes and works out 45 minutes comes back up and she's dead and she's cold [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4741.860000000001s)]
*  To the touch according to him in the 901 call. She's already cold in a warm apartment [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4749.06s)]
*  Now that takes a little bit of time right there for the body temp to go down [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4756.34s)]
*  But he says she was cold to the touch [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4761.46s)]
*  In a heated apartment in the kitchen [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4764.900000000001s)]
*  That presents an issue for the medical examiner as to the time of death [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4772.02s)]
*  Why do I care about the time of death because that rules suspects in or out? [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4776.660000000001s)]
*  According to the medical examiner now [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4781.700000000001s)]
*  This is no longer considered a suicide and what we're waiting on is a local da to re launch the investigation [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4783.700000000001s)]
*  That has not happened [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4790.5s)]
*  I don't know why and really [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4792.740000000001s)]
*  Oh gosh, you've covered so many of these [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4795.3s)]
*  I cannot trust the Philadelphia district attorney's office because they've already [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4797.9400000000005s)]
*  Screwed it up once [[01:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4802.66s)]
*  I can't trust the pa [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4804.42s)]
*  Authorities this has got to be handled by the feds. There's just really no other alternative [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4806.5s)]
*  They never found the fiance's dna on the knife. This was a shoddy investigation [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4812.5s)]
*  No question [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4817.62s)]
*  But what I read it in any event is that his dna was not found on the knife and that he was not found [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4818.1s)]
*  With blood all over him. I actually would have thought he would have had some blood on him just from [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4822.82s)]
*  that purported attempt at cpr that we heard him go through with the 911 operator, but [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4827.7s)]
*  you know [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4833.22s)]
*  Again, just because as I look at I don't understand how it could be anybody else [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4835.06s)]
*  I suppose there could have been somebody lying in wait in a closet and then they killed her [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4838.5s)]
*  And then when they ran out of the apartment, they slammed the door so hard that somehow the latch [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4843.54s)]
*  connected [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4848.66s)]
*  Maybe that's that's a possibility. But if you go with the odds and you look at the fiance [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4850.5s)]
*  it just doesn't like make sense to me that he [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4856.74s)]
*  I don't know. He came back up. She had locked him out. He allegedly broke down the door [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4861.78s)]
*  He says he locked down that he broke down the door and at that point [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4865.86s)]
*  If he did something to her would it would the murder have occurred then nancy? [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4870.82s)]
*  Is that the if you're against the fiance in this hypothetical world? [[01:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4874.1s)]
*  Would that have been the moment of murder or prior to the workout? [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4878.42s)]
*  I believe at this juncture speculating as to the identity of the killer [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4885.860000000001s)]
*  Will damage the investigation [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4894.18s)]
*  If you think about what the police did or did not do [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4897.38s)]
*  I'm not defending anyone or pointing the finger at anyone [[01:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4902.18s)]
*  I got to get this case reopened but [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4905.78s)]
*  Of course, they're going to look at the fiance [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4909.54s)]
*  But did the parents think it was the fiance the parents think she was a domestic abuse victim and they point to those [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4911.54s)]
*  Old bruises that were found 11 bruises on her body that predated the date of her death. Keep going. Sorry [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4918.179999999999s)]
*  The police did not determine had there been visitors [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4927.3s)]
*  Visitors in the apartment had there been visitors in the lobby? [[01:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4931.14s)]
*  Was there another access for visitors or intruders to get in? [[01:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4937.14s)]
*  Had there been delivery people? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4941.46s)]
*  Had she been stalked at school? Did anyone follow her home? [[01:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4943.62s)]
*  Is there video surveillance in the parking lot or in the hallways or in the trash chute areas? [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4948.02s)]
*  Had she had any complaints? [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4957.3s)]
*  Had she had any threats? [[01:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4959.54s)]
*  I think that the investigation was so bad. I remember a time [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4962.900000000001s)]
*  When I was prosecuting there was this beautiful young pre-k teacher her name is Julie Love [[01:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4969.06s)]
*  and she [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4975.7s)]
*  disappeared [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4977.54s)]
*  And it was assumed that she was murdered and many people called for the fiance to be indicted [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4979.14s)]
*  It was obvious to everyone he did it he did it listen to this [[01:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4985.88s)]
*  Years later years later like five or six years later [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4991.96s)]
*  A woman came into the pd police department apd and had been beaten horribly. Ag assault beating [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=4996.04s)]
*  She said it was her boyfriend [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5003.08s)]
*  Emanuel Hammons, I still remember his name [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5006.18s)]
*  And she said hey, hey, hey, I got something else for you. He killed Julie Love [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5009.96s)]
*  There was no connection between them at all [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5014.360000000001s)]
*  What really happened? [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5017.72s)]
*  Emanuel Hammons and some of his friends were driving along saw her [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5019.72s)]
*  chased her [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5025.8s)]
*  raped her beat her killed her [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5027.16s)]
*  Threw her body away and you know what they found of her when they went to where the girlfriend I directed them [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5030.68s)]
*  They found her glass eye [[01:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5036.280000000001s)]
*  Nobody even knew she had a glass eye [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5038.280000000001s)]
*  A glass eye and a bone the remains of Julie Love [[01:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5040.599999999999s)]
*  And the da in his wisdom had been goaded to try and indict the boyfriend. He never did it [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5044.679999999999s)]
*  Thank goodness [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5052.12s)]
*  Because someone else killed Julie Love that is a true story [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5053.48s)]
*  so [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5057.719999999999s)]
*  I'm very careful about naming a would-be suspect because that's what it looks like now [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5058.92s)]
*  I don't know what it looks like because the police did not do their job [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5065.08s)]
*  So I need all the facts this has to be reopened [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5070.599999999999s)]
*  I don't want to reach a convenient conclusion. I want to reach her parents [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5075.639999999999s)]
*  True conclusion, but you got to look at the fiance sure like the husband like the ex like the boyfriend [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5079.4s)]
*  You always look at those closest to the victim. Of course, but here's what he says. Um [[01:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5084.36s)]
*  Sam Goldberg he gave this statement to cnn in 2024 2024. It's his first public statement. He hasn't spoken at all [[01:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5089.96s)]
*  This is as much as we could find [[01:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5096.28s)]
*  When ellen took her own life it left me bewildered [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5098.679999999999s)]
*  She was a wonderful and kind person who had everything to live for when she died a part of me died with her [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5101.96s)]
*  Unimaginably in the years that have passed [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5107.62s)]
*  I've had to endure the unimaginable passing of my future wife and the pathetic and despicable attempts to desecrate my reputation and her privacy [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5109.5599999999995s)]
*  By creating a narrative that embraces lies distortions and falsehoods in order to avoid the truth [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5117.32s)]
*  Mental illness is very real and has many victims [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5122.679999999999s)]
*  I hope and pray that you never lose someone you love like I did to a terrible disease [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5126.2s)]
*  And then be accused by ignorant and misinformed people of causing her death if you're really writing a truthful story [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5130.6s)]
*  Dig deeper and please do some good by raising awareness for mental health best sg [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5136.84s)]
*  so [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5142.92s)]
*  He obviously believes she was mentally ill and that she took her own life [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5144.2s)]
*  And really hasn't said anything other than that since we heard on that 911 call him saying [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5149.0s)]
*  She stabbed herself. She fell on a knife one of those two things [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5154.92s)]
*  I'm aware of that. Um, I believe in light of the fact that the original medical examiner has now stated [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5163.96s)]
*  That this is not a suicide [[01:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5172.12s)]
*  There's really no other alternative other than this is a homicide [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5175.0s)]
*  um [[01:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5179.88s)]
*  Wasn't that a weird statement is again I ask you didn't the the the the uh [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5181.96s)]
*  A counter argument to that is that he just came out and did that to settle this case [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5185.96s)]
*  That the parents brought and he said he did he withdrew the suicide declaration, but he didn't say homicide [[01:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5189.96s)]
*  He said something else which is not you know, it's kind of weak sauce [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5196.2s)]
*  And that will not exactly help a new prosecutor say I want to take this on as a homicide case [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5201.16s)]
*  Right [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5206.76s)]
*  There are only a limited number of cods manners manners of death and those manners of death are [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5211.4800000000005s)]
*  suicide accident [[01:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5219.22s)]
*  natural cause [[01:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5222.04s)]
*  Undetermined in homicide. It's obviously not natural. She didn't die of a heart attack. They've said it's not suicide [[01:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5224.1s)]
*  Okay, we're running out of things not natural [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5231.5s)]
*  Not suicide. It's clearly not an accident that leaves two when he's tabloids alternatives only [[01:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5235.18s)]
*  undetermined [[01:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5241.74s)]
*  and homicide [[01:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5242.9400000000005s)]
*  Those is he says it's not suicide. He's not the only one [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5244.46s)]
*  Everyone is falling in line now and agreeing. It's not suicide. So [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5249.82s)]
*  unless everyone else is a medical examiner that has [[01:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5254.9400000000005s)]
*  Is a medical examiner that has [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5257.74s)]
*  inspected the body and read all the autopsy reports and every centilla of evidence and know more than all these doctors [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5259.74s)]
*  Then it is not suicide [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5267.66s)]
*  It is not accident. It is not natural causes [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5269.66s)]
*  It's either homicide or undetermined [[01:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5273.5s)]
*  It's homicide [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5277.099999999999s)]
*  That's not a leap of faith or logic [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5278.54s)]
*  So you need the federal doj to get involved at the time this is where we are now and I am not [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5282.86s)]
*  Ready to point the finger at him or anybody else? [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5289.98s)]

*  Normally, I think I know exactly what happened based on the facts that we've got [[01:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5299.5s)]
*  Yeah, you're not shy. The problem here is that we don't have the facts. We don't have them because of the shoddy investigation [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5303.58s)]
*  It's got to be started at the beginning the very beginning with what we've got left [[01:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5310.42s)]
*  I remember having to restart a murder investigation [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5315.62s)]
*  That was tried when I was in law school [[01:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5319.3s)]
*  It took all the way up to the 11th circuit court of appeals one step below the u.s supreme court [[01:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5323.22s)]
*  It landed back in the da's office [[01:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5328.1s)]
*  Because of by the way interlocking confessions interlocking statements [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5330.820000000001s)]
*  They had to be ruled out the whole thing had to be retried [[01:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5335.9400000000005s)]
*  Severed the two defendants separately and I got it when I got to the evidence room megan [[01:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5338.82s)]
*  There were two pieces of evidence left [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5344.1s)]
*  An x-ray which I couldn't make heads or tails. I even didn't know who it belonged to and a hat [[01:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5346.5s)]
*  That said kiss my bass [[01:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5352.1s)]
*  I had to start ground zero [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5355.22s)]
*  And work the case up got a conviction by the way. Well, I mean he did of course you did the jury did the right thing [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5357.7s)]
*  and that is what is happening here and [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5364.5s)]
*  It's so easy to go. Yeah, this means that that means this [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5368.5s)]
*  But that is not prudent [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5373.54s)]
*  In pursuing justice in this case. What is prudent right now? [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5376.66s)]
*  Is that we get an independent investigator and the only clear cut path I see megan [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5382.5s)]
*  Is a fed and you know, I don't like the feds either [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5389.22s)]

*  Shapiro is tainted because he's the ag that was embroiled at the beginning that [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5397.28s)]
*  Washed his hands and turned the other way like ponch's pilot. That's him. He did nothing [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5402.5s)]
*  You can't have anyone connected to the earlier a da's office. In fact, I ran down a [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5408.58s)]

*  She saw he was wearing a mask but recognized his bushy eyebrows. The judge has said that will not be barred [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5640.44s)]
*  That's a matter for cross-examination [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5647.08s)]
*  secondly [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5649.14s)]
*  The uh the defense wanted to bring up that he's on the autism spectrum [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5650.68s)]
*  In like opening so that it might explain away what they suggested were some of his odd behaviors [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5657.0s)]
*  Perhaps during the hearing or during the trial [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5664.04s)]
*  And the judge said you're not bringing that in you can if you want to put them on the stand and talk about him [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5667.24s)]
*  Being on the spectrum great [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5672.12s)]
*  But you can't just offer testimony as the lawyers in order to explain away either his behavior in the court [[01:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5674.12s)]
*  or any of the other behavior in this case and [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5680.2s)]
*  They also asked him if they could call an expert to talk about his alleged ocd [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5684.2s)]
*  Because they said prosecutors may make arguments that kohlberger was destroying evidence right before law enforcement arrested him [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5690.12s)]
*  And so they wanted to get around having him testify by having an expert take the stand [[01:34:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5698.36s)]
*  And say that's his ocd because I guess [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5703.56s)]
*  Everybody who's got ocd puts all of their garbage in little ziplock baggies and then has the garbage disposed of in the neighbor's trash [[01:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5706.92s)]

*  Now the judge has ruled that they may not bring in evidence of alleged autism [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5731.4800000000005s)]
*  On kohlberger's behalf in the case in chief [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5738.84s)]
*  This is a death penalty case. It is a bifurcated trial trial split in two first [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5742.68s)]
*  There's the guilt innocence phase and if he is found guilty, which I predict he will be [[01:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5747.32s)]
*  There is in the second phase of the trial which is the sentencing phase where the jury will decide whether he gets the death penalty [[01:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5752.28s)]
*  Now regarding autism the defense wanted to bring in [[01:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5760.12s)]
*  His their theory that he has autism although apparently [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5766.04s)]
*  None of the defense experts have stated thus far that he is autistic or under the spectrum [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5770.28s)]
*  None of them have said that [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5778.92s)]
*  They said they wanted to bring it in as you surmised [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5781.639999999999s)]
*  Because of his odd behavior what odd behavior the judge says I don't see any odd behavior. He just sits there [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5786.06s)]
*  So therefore that's irrelevant [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5794.06s)]
*  If it becomes relevant [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5797.26s)]
*  Then I will review your motion again if you choose to renew it [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5799.26s)]
*  But as of right now the only way it would be relevant is if they noted quirky or odd behavior when he takes a stand [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5803.74s)]
*  So if you want to bring it in then sure [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5812.62s)]
*  But he'll have to take the stand because just sitting there. I don't see any relevance [[01:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5816.299999999999s)]
*  However, if there is a guilty verdict and it goes to [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5822.78s)]
*  Sentencing I believe the judge will relent [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5826.679999999999s)]
*  And bring in if there is any [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5830.139999999999s)]
*  Any expert that says he is autistic to diminish his capacity to commit a crime now [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5833.259999999999s)]
*  Will it diminish his capacity to commit a crime? No, that's a big no. Why this guy is the phd [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5841.58s)]
*  student [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5849.34s)]
*  He has made stellar grades [[01:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5850.7s)]
*  He is actually teaching other students [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5853.5s)]
*  He is not going to be deemed [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5858.86s)]
*  Incapable or incompetent to commit a crime [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5862.36s)]
*  In fact, he was obsessed with committing crimes, you know about the questionnaires he would send [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5865.740000000001s)]
*  Violent felons went under the guise of studying criminology. How did you feel right before you did it? [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5872.06s)]
*  How did you pick your victim? How did you make your exit? In other words, how can I get out of this without getting caught? [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5878.860000000001s)]
*  They're between a rock and a hard spot [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5885.900000000001s)]
*  His brian coberger's dna is on the knife sheath in the snap [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5887.740000000001s)]
*  Button where you put the knife in and you snap the sheath shut under a dead body [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5892.459999999999s)]
*  so [[01:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5898.94s)]
*  Again rock in a hard spot. That's where they are [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5900.459999999999s)]
*  Uh howard bloom who's been all over the reporting on this case? [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5903.74s)]
*  reports that [[01:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5907.179999999999s)]
*  kohlberger's mother maryann [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5908.86s)]
*  Uh his his reporting is that she's encouraging her son to plead not guilty not withstanding all this evidence [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5911.74s)]
*  And that there might even be a movement afoot by kohlberger's defense attorneys to somehow [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5918.7s)]
*  Rest the decision to stay in the not guilty camp away from maryann and brian [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5925.18s)]
*  As we get to the trial and somehow convince this judge to let them [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5931.42s)]
*  enter [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5936.54s)]
*  into some sort of a plea bargain negotiation with the prosecution that that brian kohlberger is [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5937.58s)]
*  Apparently not capable potentially of making this decision that the mother's overly influential [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5943.9800000000005s)]
*  And that ann taylor as defense attorney probably knows better about what's going to happen at this trial [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5949.18s)]
*  There's no world in which ann taylor can cut a deal for him without his consent, right? [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5954.780000000001s)]
*  No world [[01:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5961.1s)]
*  No world. Um [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5962.54s)]
*  As far as a guilty or not guilty [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5965.18s)]
*  no [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5967.74s)]
*  as far as a [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5969.1s)]
*  Um not guilty by reason of insanity, which he's not insane [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5971.5s)]
*  Guilty, but mentally ill he's not mentally ill. There's no way that she can usurp [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5975.9800000000005s)]
*  His ability to enter a plea either guilty or not guilty or an alfred which is I accept my [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5981.58s)]
*  Sentence, but i'm not going to say I did it [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5989.900000000001s)]
*  I don't know frankly if the state would even go along with a guilty plea for life without parole [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5993.1s)]
*  I'm not sure that they would do that [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=5998.860000000001s)]
*  They are hell bent on seeking the death penalty and he's not going to plead guilty to the death penalty [[01:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6001.0199999999995s)]
*  To me that means you're going to trial [[01:40:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6007.0199999999995s)]
*  Now there is a way that the judge could enter a blind plea [[01:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6010.62s)]
*  Which is there's no recommendation by the state, but I don't think they would do that either because what if the judge said [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6016.62s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, i'll take your guilty plea. You're getting the death penalty. So I don't think there's going to be a blind plea [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6023.5s)]
*  Uh, auntie ellard cannot plead in his behalf without his consent [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6030.22s)]
*  so with the mother [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6035.34s)]
*  Trying to convince him to stick with the not guilty according to bloom who's written a book about the case [[01:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6037.66s)]
*  um [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6045.1s)]
*  That is undue influence on the son where the defense attorney wants to enter a guilty plea [[01:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6046.54s)]
*  That's what he's saying [[01:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6052.62s)]
*  What he's saying is we're on our way to a trial which nancy will be all over and we're going to cover a lot too [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6054.62s)]
*  Great to see you buy the book what happened to ellen out today and support the center for missing and exploited children nancy. Thank you [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6059.0199999999995s)]
*  Uh, we're back tomorrow. We'll see you all then [[01:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qmn1jwFBjo0&t=6065.74s)]
