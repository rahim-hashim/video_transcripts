# Diddy Enablers Exposed, Legacy Media Hacks, & Meghan's "Working Mom" Narrative, w/ Maureen Callahan
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 23, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Friday. Lots [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=0.0s)]
*  to get to today, including more on the cover up of former president Biden's cognitive decline. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4.36s)]
*  And I mean, I really feel like we need to say attempted cover up attempted. We knew [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=9.32s)]
*  anyone with eyes and ears knew, but there was more to it than was publicly revealed [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=15.82s)]
*  and that's starting to come out. And by the way, it's going to keep coming out. This [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=21.36s)]
*  book by Tapper and Thompson is not the last. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  There will be additional books. There will be, you know, now that people have realized [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=27.8s)]
*  you can make money off of telling the truth about him, more people will do it. That's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=31.04s)]
*  America. Also an investigation now into his use of the auto pen. You've heard president [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=35.0s)]
*  Trump railing about this. Did you know there's actually an investigation underway right now [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=40.980000000000004s)]
*  into that? And there is reportedly a whistleblower, a top Democrat who has come forward to the [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=44.92s)]
*  person doing the investigation to say exactly who was running the auto pen and why. So we [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=51.64s)]
*  could actually learn a lot more about that. Plus Scott Pelly whines about the Trump administration [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=57.04s)]
*  in a wild commencement speech down at Wake Forest University. Those poor kids at Wake [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=63.16s)]
*  Forest. Why were they subjected to Scott Pelly? Who's making these choices? All that plus [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=68.16s)]
*  at the world premiere. You thought we were done, but we're not the world premiere of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=73.16s)]
*  part three of with love, Megan. Yes, Maureen Callahan and my take on Megan Markle's ridiculous [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=78.76s)]
*  Netflix show. Our own homemade parody of it has a third and final part and you will see [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=88.28s)]
*  it today here only here to discuss it all and more. The host of the new hit podcast, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=94.30000000000001s)]
*  the nerve with Maureen Callahan, the lady herself on the MK media podcast network. And [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=102.34s)]

*  I've been introduced to extensions. Aren't they wonderful? Except like I have to take [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=190.2s)]
*  them out at night because my hair is so damaged. I'm going platinum. I am going to hook you [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=195.39999999999998s)]
*  up with Sarah. We know already because we were astronauts together. Okay. We're forever. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=200.2s)]
*  You know, yeah. And she's going to make life easy for you. Okay. I mean, just a couple [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=204.88s)]
*  lectures in there. Give you just a little extra boom. Thank you. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. So [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=208.72s)]
*  there's a lot to go over. I think we should start with Diddy because like, can we just [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=213.72s)]
*  put, don't you put the legality to the side for one second and just start with what an [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=218.55999999999997s)]
*  incredible disgusting dirt bag we're learning. He is, he denies everything. He denies everything. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=222.79999999999998s)]
*  He doesn't deny smacking her and kicking her and hitting her on the internet on the intercontinental [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=227.88s)]
*  tape. So we know he did that. But witness by witness, what we're seeing is this guy's [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=232.51999999999998s)]
*  a monster and we've had his former assistants come forward to talk about the abuse they [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=238.56s)]
*  witnessed this week. There was one saying he quit because he just couldn't stand the [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=244.08s)]
*  amount of abuse that he was heaping, not just on star witness, Cassie Ventura, but other [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=247.8s)]
*  women too. And just pretty much everybody who takes the stand has another story about [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=252.88s)]
*  Diddy abusing some woman. I mean, brutally abusing them. Yes. And even his, I believe [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=257.78s)]
*  his personal assistant was brutalized for Diddy sent him to go to Whole Foods. I just, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=264.46s)]
*  I love the details, right? Like the Quodidian details where you're like, Oh, Diddy's like [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=269.53999999999996s)]
*  shopping at Whole Foods or buying baby oil in Balka Costco, right? Like the sort of pedestrian [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=274.2s)]
*  things that you know, you or I might engage in. And he said, go get me a gallon, a gallon [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=279.34s)]
*  of some kind of ionized water. I don't know. They didn't have a gallon in stock. So he [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=284.85999999999996s)]
*  comes back with two half gallons equaling one gallon, but he was savaged for that because [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=289.14s)]
*  Diddy wanted the one gallon. So it's like those details. But this week has seen so many [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=294.74s)]
*  great characters. Like my favorite was the Punisher. Yeah, you're right. The sex worker. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=300.18s)]
*  Okay. The sex worker who's dressed like something out of a Marvel comic, like an S and M Marvel [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=305.3s)]
*  comic, right? Right. The mask with the spikes on it. And then like this and that. And he's [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=311.26s)]
*  published itself published a book called Freezer Meat. That was an interesting moment where [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=316.97999999999996s)]
*  they asked him why. And the feds had the front and back cover in full color of the illo. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=322.18s)]
*  Like, it's like wild stuff's going on. And so the Punisher who I need to start following [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=328.9s)]
*  on Instagram. Right, right. He needs to become part of our life. Definitely. So he's talking [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  about his book Freezer Meat was about erectile dysfunction. And he had trouble performing [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=338.34s)]
*  for Diddy and Cassie and Diddy who he first comfort the first encounter incomes this like [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=346.06s)]
*  oiled up black man naked except for a burka. Like it's these details where you're like, [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=351.73999999999995s)]
*  what's going on in these hotels? Like it's kind of funny. Like there's something like [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=358.82s)]
*  crazy dignity, whatever dignity Sean Combs may have had remain is being stripped away [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=364.62s)]
*  like with every single witness who gets on that stamp. You know, yes. So they the lawyer [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=369.62s)]
*  asked him, why would you call your book Freezer Meat? And he said, what's harder than that? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=374.5s)]
*  And his book is about erectile dysfunction. What's harder than Freezer Meat? I can think [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=380.21999999999997s)]
*  of a couple of things. But in any event, that is him, I guess being self deprecating. But [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=385.78s)]
*  yeah, I guess he's had a problem with this, which I mean, frankly, he's in the wrong line [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=390.38s)]
*  of work because you can get away with that as a news anchor. Nobody would ever know. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=393.98s)]
*  Like if you're going into the sex worker trade, it does become an issue, I imagine. And he [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=397.98s)]
*  was talking about how I imagine when you're having like forced sex or sex acts with Cassie [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=404.7s)]
*  Ventura and somebody's watching you, what he suggested was he'd been performing oral [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=409.74s)]
*  on her and then Diddy wanted him to, you know, go the next level and he couldn't. And so [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=415.22s)]
*  he's writing about like this erectile dysfunction problem and talking about it that he's having [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=421.58s)]
*  in the midst of this so-called freak off, making him perhaps not the ideal candidate [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=425.9s)]
*  for the freak off. But all of this is just background to like the serial weird sexual [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=430.38s)]
*  obsessions of P Diddy and his treating Cassie Ventura like she was a piece of meat, like [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=435.58s)]
*  she was his property. That's what we're getting. Yes. And some of the more harrowing testimony [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=442.86s)]
*  I think came from Cassie's mother who got on the stand and said, Sean Combs personally [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=448.70000000000005s)]
*  called her. Like he could have had one of his henchmen do it, but he personally called [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=453.94s)]
*  her and said, if you don't give me $20,000, I am going to release a sex tape of your daughter. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=458.38000000000005s)]
*  This woman is not for money. Okay. She had to refinance her house to get $20,000, which [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=464.58000000000004s)]
*  for Sean Combs is like changing the couch cushions. You know what I mean? He's got that [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=469.82000000000005s)]
*  in that Gucci bag. He has a security guard carrying around, running around with like [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=473.98s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars so he can pay people off at these hotels. Right. She [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=477.3s)]
*  had to refinance her house, which takes months to do. And so she's living in fear that her [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=481.5s)]
*  daughter will be will be humiliated in this way by this monster who then takes the $20,000 [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=486.98s)]
*  from her. He takes it. You know, like that's a kind of sadism that is so I mean, he is [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=494.3s)]
*  psychologically such a sick, sick, sick guy. And, you know, I heard you your coverage of [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=499.94s)]
*  it earlier this week, like whether or not he's found guilty, he's done. He's done. He [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=505.82s)]
*  better be. I mean, I feel like you and I will do our level best to make sure that's the [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=510.38s)]
*  case. He's been a serial bully for the people who work for him, for the women he dates. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=514.34s)]
*  And the mother, yeah, she gets, she's only on the stand for 30 minutes, but that she [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=519.7s)]
*  told that story. And then once she gives it to him, she said to remortgage her house, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=522.78s)]
*  she gets the 20,000, she gives it to him. Couple days pass, he gives it back. Oh, I [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=526.62s)]
*  guess he had like an attack of conscience, like, oh, maybe I shouldn't be harassing my [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=530.94s)]
*  girlfriend's mother for money she doesn't have. But I think he does enjoy the exercise [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=535.26s)]
*  of just making people subjugate themselves to him and seeing, especially with women, [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=539.8199999999999s)]
*  how much he can demean them and demoralize them. There's been testimony this week that [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=545.62s)]
*  he had, he sat next to Cassie on a plane. And I can't remember whether it was, it must [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=550.58s)]
*  have been a private jet, but I thought they were saying it was a public jet. There were [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=557.58s)]
*  certainly other people around and he made her look at video he had taken of one of the [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=560.02s)]
*  freak offs. And he threatened her saying he would release it like he was ready to use [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=565.06s)]
*  this and publicly humiliate her if she didn't do what he wanted. So on the one hand, you [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=570.4599999999999s)]
*  have that stuff and you have the video of the beating and you have had multiple witnesses [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=576.14s)]
*  testify about seeing him beat her. Her friend got on the stand and testified to that. She [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=580.86s)]
*  just had a makeup artist get on the stand and say she saw her after he had beaten her [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=587.2199999999999s)]
*  with knots all over her head, a fat lip, a black eye. The makeup artist tried to help [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=591.62s)]
*  her. The assistant to Sean Diddy Combs saying I had to quit because I couldn't take the [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=597.14s)]
*  beatings. Cassie only testified to a few of these. She said it happened regularly, but [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=601.66s)]
*  the prosecution didn't even bring out every beating. It was like all these other people [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=606.62s)]
*  who remember, oh no, there was this beating and that beating and another beating. And [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=609.74s)]
*  what the defense is trying to hang its hat onto is there's testimony from her saying, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=614.02s)]
*  why didn't you leave? And yes, she did testify. I felt threatened and so on. I was afraid [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=619.6999999999999s)]
*  of him, but also she testified and admitted she loved him and she did enjoy the lifestyle. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=623.8599999999999s)]
*  She liked the cars and she liked the homes and the defense is going to try to drive a [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=631.16s)]
*  truck through that. They put on Kid Cudi yesterday, this rapper, and separate it apart from the [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=635.2199999999999s)]
*  arson charge that he's trying to build. They're trying to build with him. He painted Cassie [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=641.5799999999999s)]
*  as not all that great because he suggested she was dating him while lying about the fact [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=646.7800000000001s)]
*  that she had left Diddy when she hadn't. And he used the word played. She played me. She [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=651.46s)]
*  played me and she played him. And the defense too is they're going to try to paint her as [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=656.7800000000001s)]
*  like this manipulative, strong, they're of her own volition. She loved the car. She loved [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=661.36s)]
*  the lavish lifestyle. She could have left at any time. She arranged the freak off. She [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=668.46s)]
*  called the sex workers. And I just think, yes, that's what they have to argue. But if [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=672.62s)]
*  you look at the greater context of the proof going in on that case, Maureen, it's just [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=677.54s)]
*  so clear that there was an overlying control that he had of her almost from the very beginning. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=681.66s)]
*  I think there's no question about that. As for Kid Cudi, it's sort of like, you know, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=689.02s)]
*  she played me. Okay, well, you're a grown man, you know, and you're in like a very flashy, [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=693.02s)]
*  smooth moving industry. I'm sure she wasn't like your one and only. Sorry. Okay. And then [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=697.82s)]
*  the testimony he gave about Sean Combs blowing up his Porsche. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=702.7800000000001s)]
*  This is crazy. Remember when you and I talked about this? It was just a rumor. You know, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=707.38s)]
*  she had made an allegation in her complaint or civil complaint, which he settled the next [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=711.38s)]
*  day, but we didn't know if it was true. And now you've got the actual singer, Kid Cudi [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=715.0600000000001s)]
*  on the stand. Go ahead. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=719.34s)]
*  So they, months later, they have a summit Diddy and Cudi. Okay. The summit was at the [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=721.62s)]
*  Soho house in LA. Okay. Where everyone has their big so it's after you blow up my luxury [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=726.9s)]
*  vehicle. Let's meet for a cocktail at the Soho house. So how bad is it? You know, how [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=732.9399999999999s)]
*  bad is it now? I believe that the prosecution is putting on a witness much as the prosecution [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=741.42s)]
*  did in the Harvey case round one, which went to speaking to how victims of sexual violence [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=746.24s)]
*  or domestic violence often are in love with their abuser. They did. They put on a woman [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=753.5600000000001s)]
*  who testified in a few of these cases. She was a witness in Amber versus Johnny and I [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=758.24s)]
*  maybe the wine state can't remember the second case. But she testified just in general. She [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=763.8s)]
*  hadn't examined Diddy, but she was testifying to that dynamic in domestic abuse relationships. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=768.72s)]
*  And I'll never forget the details in Cassie's lawsuit, her civil filing against Diddy, which [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=774.2s)]
*  went to there were two incredibly violent things. One, he had her get breast implants [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=778.68s)]
*  in LA. And the day after he was like, I don't like the way these look. And he took her back [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=783.92s)]
*  to the surgeon and said, remove them and put in different ones. And the surgeon said, I [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=789.28s)]
*  can't, she needs to heal first. And this surgeon that's like Diddy made him fear for his life. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=793.7199999999999s)]
*  And he did it. He did it. And then the other one was after they left some awards event, [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=798.12s)]
*  he began stomping her face in the back of an SUV and the driver slash bodyguard tried [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=804.0s)]
*  to intervene. And Diddy was like, if I recall correctly, basically I'll kill you if you [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=809.2s)]
*  don't back off. This is my woman and I'll do what I want with her. [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=814.28s)]
*  That was one of the rare times someone tried to intervene because what we've seen in these [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=817.4s)]
*  past two weeks is people under his employer, under his thumb, not intervening and feeling [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=821.12s)]
*  really bad about it, feeling disgusted with themselves for allowing it to happen. But [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=827.84s)]
*  I think they all knew like they were afraid of him. I think so too. You know, they didn't [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=832.2s)]
*  know what he was capable of. I think they knew what he was capable of. Right, right. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=836.2s)]
*  That's the better question. Yeah. Like what was he capable of? I mean, I think, you know, [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=840.32s)]
*  from a legal aspect, I'm really interested in your thoughts because you know, what I [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=843.9200000000001s)]
*  love is that the prosecution has video and you can't lie your way out of video. Okay. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=847.96s)]
*  And the jury seeing those still photos of the freak offs and two members at least visibly [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=851.88s)]
*  And it takes a lot for a New York jury to be disgusted. It's true. What do you think [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=857.6s)]
*  the prosecution is building towards? Do you think they are building towards interstate [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=863.48s)]
*  sex trafficking? Because other than that, like, yes, he's disgusting, but he's not on [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=867.8000000000001s)]
*  trial for domestic violence. Well, so it's, it's complicated. I think they've got him [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=871.76s)]
*  on the transportation to engage in prostitution count. That's the third count. It's only got [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=876.9200000000001s)]
*  a year's penalty, but he's got multiple potential offenses on it. But it's the least serious [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=881.2s)]
*  of the charges brought against him. They've had so much testimony that he did. He did [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=886.08s)]
*  pay prostitutes. You know, she was calling. What was it called? Like cowboys for angels. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=890.24s)]
*  There's some, we're not living a big life. Okay. There's a lot. Like I just like one [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=895.8000000000001s)]
*  invitation to a sex party. Just one. Well, we went to space and we didn't make Meghan [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=902.22s)]
*  Markle like, maybe next we need to make a phone call to cowboys for angels and see [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=907.36s)]
*  her. So anyway, they, they, they've proven beyond a doubt that he was engaging in, you [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=911.72s)]
*  know, hiring and transporting prostitutes, but you've got sex trafficking by fraud or [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=919.76s)]
*  coercion is this is the middle count. And originally I thought that the, the sex trafficking [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=926.52s)]
*  involved the prostitute and the coercion involved Cassie. Like he was kind of forcing Cassie [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=935.24s)]
*  to be in this room and no question there was a sex worker in there, but I've since [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=941.12s)]
*  come to understand from sources close to the case. That's not it. That it's Cassie who's [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=945.36s)]
*  been sex trafficked in the theory of the prosecutors. That it's that they are arguing he by coercion [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=952.58s)]
*  or fraud, et cetera. But I think they're going with coercion forced her to engage in these [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=962.44s)]
*  not every single time, right? Of course, of course, but many, many times. And even during [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=968.6s)]
*  certain times on like the backend, maybe she was there voluntarily in the front end, but [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=973.2s)]
*  then, you know, but overall, I think they're going to argue that right after the beginning [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=977.48s)]
*  of the relationship, things switched to a place where she did not want to be doing this. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=981.48s)]
*  And she was only there because she was afraid of him or he was threatening her or she knew [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=986.48s)]
*  she was going to be publicly humiliated by the tapes getting released or he was going [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=991.46s)]
*  to beat her again. And so they're arguing he was forcing her to sex traffic herself [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=995.2s)]
*  in these freak offs. That's the theory. And they're doing a pretty good job. You know, [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1000.4s)]
*  they're doing an excellent job, to be honest. The defense to it is her voluntarily calling [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1005.5600000000001s)]
*  the sex workers. And I use that term in quotes voluntarily. Was it or wasn't it? The jury [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1011.26s)]
*  will have to decide her texts saying, I can't wait to freak off again. But again, there's [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1015.28s)]
*  another text saying I can't wait to freak out. It's great. I love the freak offs when [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1022.04s)]
*  we both want them. Oh, she said that. Yeah, interesting. And you also have to wonder like [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1025.92s)]
*  at what point is she just trying to placate him? Right? I love the freak offs like does [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1030.8799999999999s)]
*  she you know, it's like putting an emoji at the end of something or just like whatever. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1034.76s)]
*  But you know, the other thing is she got with him. I think she was 19. And he was maybe [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1038.84s)]
*  30 very well established, immediately a power dynamic right there. She's bringing he's bringing [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1043.96s)]
*  her into this world. There was there was that little bit of testimony that I thought [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1049.96s)]
*  was really salient that he brought Britney Spears to her birthday party when they first [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1053.92s)]
*  were dating. That was like a flex. He at one point made her shave her head. There are images [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1057.8s)]
*  of her with like half of her head shaved. And she's such a beautiful woman. It doesn't [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1063.08s)]
*  impede her beauty at all. But I think it was a way of him trying to strip her of that power [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1067.0s)]
*  she had her own beauty. And then the other thing we were reminded of this week was Wendy [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1072.08s)]
*  Williams. Oh, yeah, saying long ago, everyone in the hip hop community knows Sean combs [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1076.76s)]
*  is gay. Makes sense. This is what he thinks of women. He's such a misogynist. He beats [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1083.12s)]
*  the shit out of them on the regular. And that he tried to have her fired or successfully [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1088.2s)]
*  had her fired from a gig. And I mean, that's the kind of level of power he was trying to [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1093.08s)]
*  execute all over the place like trying to take somebody's livelihood because you know, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1099.76s)]
*  Do we have that sound bite? I thought we pulled that Wendy Williams thing because she got [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1104.28s)]
*  fired from her job for making a comment. Oh, we do. Oh, yeah, she was working for Hot 97. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1108.68s)]
*  Just want to clarify. My team's saying that the prostitution charge has a has a 10 year [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1113.92s)]
*  potential sentence. I, I got to go back and look at that because I remember looking at [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1119.1200000000001s)]
*  this and seeing it was one, in any event, one to 10, let's say, and he's 18 years older [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1122.56s)]
*  than she is. So she I mean, she was a kid. 19. He's 18 years older. Oh, that's significant. [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1128.28s)]
*  And when he met her at 19, he was almost twice her age. I mean, like, that's ridiculous, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1133.48s)]
*  not to mention one of the most powerful rich men in music and in the country. All right. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1137.56s)]
*  So here's Wendy Williams. This is back in 1998. In the call that got her fired from [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1142.52s)]
*  Hot 97, sought 28. I just want to know, I mean, every, do you really think that every [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1149.8s)]
*  player is gay or every other player is the thing? Are you a little gay? I'm not gay obsessed [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1156.2s)]
*  and every other would be an exaggeration, but I would say two out of 10 in sports and [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1162.8000000000002s)]
*  five out of 10 in music. Okay. Yes. And I don't think that's gay obsessed. I think that's [[00:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1171.24s)]
*  after being in this business for over 20 something years and seeing things from the inside out [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1177.24s)]
*  and the outside. [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1182.68s)]
*  So next thing she knows, she's fired. And then again, that was 1998. And then she spoke [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1185.5800000000002s)]
*  to Howard Stern in 2006 and he brought it up. Watch this. Did you get fired from making [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1191.8s)]
*  fun of puppy? Something like that. Listen, you figure it out. You do the music of what [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1199.76s)]
*  was playing back in 1980, 1998 on the majority of every radio station, 25 times an hour. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1206.8s)]
*  Okay. It's not a denial. And the last but not least, Diddy went on the Wendy Williams [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1214.84s)]
*  show in 2017. So now we're, you know, many years after her firing, almost 20 years after [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1220.56s)]
*  her firing because of that comment. And he makes some comment about her son. Watch this. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1229.2s)]
*  As the mother of a now 16 year old who I met backstage, he did. He's great. Great. Oh, [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1236.28s)]
*  Thank you. Um, you represent a lot. [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1243.64s)]
*  You can see how awkward she is as soon as she hears they met. And he's now got a visual [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1252.04s)]
*  on the sun. And I would submit to you, Wendy Williams was concerned to hear that the two [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1257.8600000000001s)]
*  of them had had an exchange backstage. [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1263.44s)]
*  Well, I think that's very, that clip is really interesting because it takes a lot to trip [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1265.6000000000001s)]
*  Wendy Williams up. This is a woman who would get on TV five days a week, much as you do [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1271.4s)]
*  and speak extemporaneously, you know, and she's this, this is her world. She's been [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1275.76s)]
*  in it forever. And Sean combs, you can tell she's my opinion that she's taking that as [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1280.16s)]
*  a not so thinly veiled threat. Okay. You've got your life back now. You've got your job [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1286.92s)]
*  back now. I allowed that for you. Oh, your 16 year old son is backstage. You can't tell [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1292.1200000000001s)]
*  me she didn't know the stories about usher a 14 year old usher who was fed to him for [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1297.1599999999999s)]
*  at least a year in that townhouse who later told rolling stone that he would walk around [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1301.84s)]
*  that townhouse and in peek through bedroom doors that were left open and see orgies happening. [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1307.04s)]
*  You know, the depravity and you can't, you know, we're all watching Justin Bieber decline [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1313.4399999999998s)]
*  before our very eyes. And, you know, he, he issued a statement or his people issued a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1319.2399999999998s)]
*  statement this week that said he is not a victim. Please leave him alone. But, you know, [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1323.76s)]
*  I think we're all looking at what seems to be the severity of the collateral damage. [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1327.84s)]
*  And, you know, we'll see what else comes out. You know, when stuff like this happens and [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1335.36s)]
*  people begin, I'm, I'm amazed that Cassie feels emboldened enough at like nearly nine [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1340.28s)]
*  months pregnant, knowing the, knowing this guy, the feds would, he tried to get bail [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1344.68s)]
*  three times and every judge said, no, he is a danger to potential witnesses. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1349.24s)]
*  I mean, and she's the star witness. It must have been important to her because any woman [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1354.24s)]
*  knows that, you know, two weeks from delivery, you know, you're feeling emotional. You're [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1359.88s)]
*  worried about your baby. You don't want that amount of cortisol running through your body, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1365.6000000000001s)]
*  you know, when you're about to give birth to another human. And yet she got herself [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1369.68s)]
*  up there and the prosecution knew that she was about to have this kid and that it would [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1373.1000000000001s)]
*  be a much different story. She probably wouldn't do it after he or she is born. So they got [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1376.52s)]
*  her on the stand. A word about Bieber, um, and through no particular source, but I will [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1380.36s)]
*  say that a source with knowledge of Bieber has suggested to us recently that he may have [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1387.52s)]
*  other issues that are causing the public meltdown now having nothing to do with Diddy. And they [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1394.52s)]
*  did put out that statement saying he's not one of Diddy's victims. Now I wouldn't expect [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1399.28s)]
*  them to say he is one. So take it for whatever it's worth. Um, but it may be that Justin [[00:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1403.56s)]
*  Bieber's got problems with other people that are causing what we're seeing on, on camera. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1409.44s)]
*  Bottom line for me is don't let your kid become a child star. Uh, 100%. Doesn't matter how [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1414.12s)]
*  much money you think you can get and doesn't matter how happy you think it will make them. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1418.9199999999998s)]
*  It won't, it won't might make them temporarily happy. They're a star. They feel cool. They [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1423.04s)]
*  all crash and burn, all crash and burn. I mean, think of it. There's like maybe one example, [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1428.8799999999999s)]
*  maybe two. Yeah. If you really search to try to find somebody, but the vast majority, even [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1434.12s)]
*  if they wind up okay in the long run, like a Drew Barrymore go through the Drew Barrymore [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1440.12s)]
*  addict stage where the mother's taking him to parties and they're taking drugs at age [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1445.04s)]
*  eight or whatever her story is. It's just not, it's not worth it. Um, wanted to go back [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1449.0s)]
*  to the kid Cuddy testimony because it was very interesting. Um, I do want to correct [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1454.16s)]
*  something on the morning update today. Uh, rare mistake. We said the kid Cuddy took the [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1459.0800000000002s)]
*  stand on Wednesday and in fact he took the stand on Thursday. Just a clarification. Um, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1463.5600000000002s)]
*  here's what he testified to. He said he met Ventura in 2008 and they were just friends. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1468.52s)]
*  They started dating around 2011. Uh, he thought that they were having problems. Ventura and [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1473.0800000000002s)]
*  Cone combs by 2011 that they weren't dating anymore. And, uh, combs told kid Cuddy by [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1478.08s)]
*  phone in December 2011 that he wanted to talk to him because he understood there might be [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1483.8799999999999s)]
*  something going on with Diddy's girl and kid Cuddy. And, uh, so he said he left the hotel [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1487.76s)]
*  he was at with Ventura and went home to his house, kid Cuddy's house. And, um, he found [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1495.28s)]
*  that there had been a break in directly following the phone call. Kid Cuddy returned home. Combs [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1501.04s)]
*  was not there, however, but he found his security cameras had been moved. Gifts he [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1505.84s)]
*  bought for his family had been opened and his dog was locked in the bathroom, which [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1511.24s)]
*  he testified was disturbing to him. Um, after the break in kid Cuddy spent the holidays [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1517.84s)]
*  with Ventura's family and received a few texts from combs, but the rapper was not interested [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1522.48s)]
*  in talking to him, citing that he believed combs, uh, and he believed combs was responsible [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1526.6999999999998s)]
*  for the break in said kid Cuddy noting that he filed a police report over it. So he was [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1531.52s)]
*  concerned, right? He, he definitely thought he was being harassed, uh, by, by Sean Diddy [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1536.4s)]
*  combs over this blossoming relationship with Cassie Ventura. Then, uh, this was, okay, [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1542.44s)]
*  December 2011 in 2011, January, 2012 kid Cuddy said his dog watcher called him from his home [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1549.24s)]
*  to tell him his car was on fire. I hate when that happens. Right? I mean that last time [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1555.8s)]
*  we had that argument over space. Next thing I knew my Beamer was gone. I don't know anything [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1560.84s)]
*  about it. Looking at the photos, kid Cuddy explained it looked quote, like the top of [[00:26:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1566.28s)]
*  my Porsche was cut open and that's where the Molotov cocktail was put in causing further [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1572.04s)]
*  damage that could not be salvaged. Combs and kid Cuddy then met in person. Oh look, this [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1576.8799999999999s)]
*  is the picture for the listening audience. Oh my God. Looking at his Porsche, which does [[00:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1581.9599999999998s)]
*  not look like a Porsche. I don't even know what that is. And I guess that's the top. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1586.36s)]
*  Is that the soft top of his Porsche? Can't even, I can't tell if it's a hard top or not. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1590.0s)]
*  I have no idea, but it no longer looks like a car. Oh, that's the seat. Oh look, that's [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1594.76s)]
*  like the seat that's been, that been on fire. That looks like a hard top. It looks like [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1600.48s)]
*  shattered glass that's been ripped open. And I guess a Molotov cocktail dropped in. So [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1605.0s)]
*  this is the, the apex of the testimony here. He says, um, finally he asked him for a meeting. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1610.82s)]
*  He said, I figured I better talk to him. Things were escalating. And clearly this guy who [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1616.88s)]
*  is like kind of bad-ass in his own right was afraid of Sean Combs because he didn't know [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1622.6000000000001s)]
*  what he was capable of. But to your point, or did he? Uh, he said, kid Cuddy arrived [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1627.4s)]
*  to his meeting who was with him and Combs was alone. He said, quote, Combs was standing [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1631.64s)]
*  there staring out the window at this, uh, so house out the staring out the window with [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1637.16s)]
*  his hands behind his back, like a Marvel super villain. And the pair went on to discuss kid [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1641.8s)]
*  Cuddy's relationship with Ventura from start to finish. He testified when kid Cuddy asked [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1647.56s)]
*  Combs about the damage to his car. Combs said, I don't know what you're talking about. Kid [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1651.3600000000001s)]
*  Cuddy didn't believe him. Uh, they ran into each other years later, uh, 2015. So three [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1657.0s)]
*  years later at a club, Combs pulled kid Cuddy aside and kid Cuddy said Combs apologized [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1663.16s)]
*  to him. Kid Cuddy added, he found peace with the situation after that. Uh, kid Cuddy did [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1669.12s)]
*  testify that Cassie Ventura told him there was physical abuse in her relationship with [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1677.34s)]
*  Combs that he would sometimes hit and kick her, which bothered kid Cuddy, but he did [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1681.76s)]
*  not hear about any sexual abuse. But there it is looking like a Marvel super villain, [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1687.6399999999999s)]
*  which by the way, there was no objection to, which I would have objected to had I been [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1693.9199999999998s)]
*  interesting. Yeah. Sean's a lawyer, but that image is now it's seared, right? Like, with [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1698.3999999999999s)]
*  the hands behind the back, you can picture it. Oh yeah. And I actually would never have [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1704.72s)]
*  assumed that Combs was alone. He may have been standing alone, but I would assume he's [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1708.8s)]
*  got guys all over that room or like cameras all over that room. My other question. So [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1712.48s)]
*  first of all, I was talking to the Daily Mail reporter who's in that courtroom every day. [[00:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1718.1599999999999s)]
*  When the, um, the apology came up, I said, well, did Sean Combs offer to pay him back? [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1723.24s)]
*  No. Class does not exist with this guy on any level. You know, I'm sorry I blew up your [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1729.24s)]
*  car, but I'm not going to give you the money. Okay. Right. Um, but you know, the other thing [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1734.6000000000001s)]
*  is sort of like the kid Cuddy stuff is just remarkable to me. Again, I can't believe this [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1738.76s)]
*  guy is testifying. I can't believe he's not afraid. And I can't believe that like usher's [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1744.44s)]
*  name came in this week. I think there are many other people who are very worried about their [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1750.12s)]
*  names coming in. You know, I go back to this LeBron, uh, video that was a zoom between, [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1755.8s)]
*  uh, him and Diddy and Diddy's on the top panel and, and LeBron's on the bottom and LeBron is [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1763.08s)]
*  saying, ain't no party like a Diddy party. And they're all laughing. You know, I, you know, [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1768.52s)]
*  the amount of people who knew and, you know, to your point, the last time we talked about it, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1774.6s)]
*  like perhaps it's just normalized in that world. Like it's a sex party. It's a sex and drug party [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1779.0s)]
*  and stuff gets crazy and that's it. But I find it hard to like the way Wendy Williams blanched, [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1785.64s)]
*  he just said, Oh, I met your kid backstage and she, you know, no, it would be terrifying. [[00:29:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1792.36s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I remember interviewing Vladimir Putin and, um, it was getting tense between us. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1798.6s)]
*  And he mentioned my children. What? Yeah. And I remember like, okay, I see what's happening here. [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1805.16s)]
*  I mean, this is what people do. It's like an implicit threat. It's just letting you know, [[00:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1812.92s)]
*  they're aware of what's important to you. And that's all, that's all it takes. You don't have [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1818.3600000000001s)]
*  to be more explicit than that. And, and you know, it's one thing LeBron to know about sex parties. [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1824.28s)]
*  It's quite another to know about beatings, regular beatings, which are illegal. That is one, [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1829.96s)]
*  a sex party isn't necessarily illegal. It is technically if you hire sex workers and if you're [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1835.8s)]
*  allegedly trafficking the other participant, but there's no question that repeated beatings, [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1840.6000000000001s)]
*  that's a battery. It's an assault. It can be a lot more. And everybody in the ditty circle looked [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1846.6000000000001s)]
*  the other way and very few, if any, intervened to help her. They allowed it. Here's the next guy, [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1852.68s)]
*  George Kaplan, former assistant to Sean Diddy Combs. He prior to testifying and without the [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1859.72s)]
*  jury present invoked his fifth amendment. Whoa. He was like, I am not saying anything because I [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1864.92s)]
*  will be incriminated. And the prosecution offered him an immunity deal, which he then took the judge [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1869.56s)]
*  watched him sign it. And once you sign an immunity deal, you can no longer assert the fifth amendment. [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1874.84s)]
*  So he was forced to take the stand. The jury didn't know he had signed that. I think they [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1879.0s)]
*  thought he was just there voluntarily. And he testified about three incidents instances where [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1883.24s)]
*  he witnessed violence from Sean Combs twice with Cassie Ventura in 2015 on Combs' private jet. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1888.84s)]
*  And then another incident later in the year where he said he saw Ventura with visible injuries at [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1897.24s)]
*  one of Combs' homes. He testified to witnessing yet another round of violent behavior where he [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1902.84s)]
*  saw Combs throw a number of decorative or real, he wasn't sure which green apples at another [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1907.8s)]
*  girlfriend hard, he said, like really trying to whip her with them. He was unsure if any of them [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1914.36s)]
*  actually hit the woman, but it wasn't for lack of trying. He said he was the guy during his period [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1919.8799999999999s)]
*  of employment where he had to go clean up the hotel rooms after Combs was in there. He was worried [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1926.76s)]
*  that hotel staff would try to sell content from his room to the magazines to try to make money. [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1932.6799999999998s)]
*  He gave notice he was leaving in September 15 and finally left in December of 2015, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1937.9599999999998s)]
*  saying, quote, the central reason that I left my job as Mr. Combs' assistant was that I was not [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1943.32s)]
*  comfortable or aligned with the physical behavior that had been going on that I had seen pieces of [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1947.96s)]
*  over the course of a couple of months. And then there's Myla Morales, former makeup artist for [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1953.48s)]
*  Combs and Ventura, who said when she first met Cassie, Cassie was 16. She was so young, [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1959.16s)]
*  this is three years before she was introduced to Diddy. And she was doing her makeup regularly [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1964.04s)]
*  when she signed with Bad Boy Records, his label in 2007. And she was like a younger sister to Mya. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1969.64s)]
*  She witnessed after a party at Prince's house, Ventura and Morales, the makeup artist, went [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1976.8400000000001s)]
*  back to a hotel room. This is around Grammy weekend 2010. And Combs made his way to the room [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1983.72s)]
*  where Ventura was, closed the door behind him and yelling and screaming ensued. Morales said, [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1988.76s)]
*  when Combs stormed out, Ventura was distraught with a swollen eye, a busted lip and knots on her [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1992.8400000000001s)]
*  head. The makeup artist took Ventura to her home where she stayed for a few days. Morales did not [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=1998.76s)]
*  call the police because she feared Combs and she feared for her life. She had a doctor friend look [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2003.08s)]
*  at Ventura who said she needed to go to the emergency room. Ventura refused. The pair never [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2007.96s)]
*  spoke of the incident again. And there was testimony by another witness that she saw Combs [[00:33:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2013.16s)]
*  try to hit Ventura with a cast iron skillet that she was making eggs in. And then he whipped a, [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2020.8400000000001s)]
*  I don't think I'm conflating my two, there's been so much evidence of abuse, but I think this is the [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2030.68s)]
*  one woman's testimony. He tried to whip a wooden hanger at her head. And then the next thing she [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2035.48s)]
*  knew, Cassie asked to see her. They had lunch together and Cassie had $30,000 for her and a [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2041.88s)]
*  non-disclosure agreement and said, just, you're making too big a deal out of it. And the woman [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2048.92s)]
*  signed the NDA and the friendship ended with Cassie because the woman just couldn't take the [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2053.64s)]
*  amount of abuse Cassie was getting. And now she'd been dragged into it. I mean, that's what people [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2058.84s)]
*  like, look, people who just want to uncover for Diddy are focusing on the testimony that I've [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2062.6s)]
*  mentioned, you know, that she has emails suggesting she wanted the freak offs from time to time. She [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2067.88s)]
*  testified the lifestyle was important to her and she didn't want to leave it. And there was some [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2073.48s)]
*  strain of materialism in her. She quote, played Kid Cudi and Diddy, which the defense is going to [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2077.64s)]
*  try to say what kind she's empowered, what, what victim who's being controlled would cheat on the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2083.8799999999997s)]
*  abuser and be controlling another man. That's where the, but there, there is a tidal wave [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2089.56s)]
*  of evidence that he was abusing her. Everyone saw it over years. We've covered the whole gamut. [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2095.4s)]
*  This is 15 of this abuse, the 16 intercontinental issue, the 2011 and 2012 stuff, Kid Cudi and like, [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2102.36s)]
*  it went on for years and this clearly was not an empowered woman who felt comfortable [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2109.56s)]
*  dealing with him from any position of power. I couldn't agree with you more. I mean, I think [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2116.1200000000003s)]
*  one of the things we're coming to terms with as a culture and we're really maturing in terms of [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2120.6800000000003s)]
*  understanding the nuances of victims of domestic violence is that there is no perfect victim. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2125.48s)]
*  There is no, you, you, there is no perfect victim. And the level, the violence with which he [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2131.48s)]
*  assaulted her, you know, going for the head so often, he was trying to disfigure her. He was [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2138.28s)]
*  trying to mar her beauty. And that video that we all saw of him kicking her in that hotel elevator [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2143.88s)]
*  bank slash hallway, that to me is a woman who's been there so many times before she went limp. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2151.56s)]
*  She was like a possum. She went like a, she shaped herself like a seed to cover her internal [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2158.04s)]
*  organs. She was just going to take it as best as she could. I don't know if it becomes kidnapping [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2162.7599999999998s)]
*  once she's trying to leave. Okay. Great. He's dragging her down the hall and putting her back [[00:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2168.84s)]
*  in that hotel room is kidnapping right there. Good. I thought so. And then you're not telling [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2172.92s)]
*  me that he's done this to her and there aren't a legion of women out there. He's also done this [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2177.72s)]
*  too, because guys like this don't do it to just one person. And that says to me, there are many [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2182.36s)]
*  women out there who are still far too afraid of Diddy to file a civil suit or to raise their hand [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2187.32s)]
*  and say, if you want me prosecution, I'll testify. You know, well think about what one of the [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2194.44s)]
*  testimonials this week was from the agent who conducted the raid on his Miami home. Two of his [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2199.6400000000003s)]
*  homes were raided. And of course it was tons of baby oil and tons of lube. Don't forget the AR [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2204.92s)]
*  15s. Well, that's where I was going. And, and so the guns, he found parts of guns disassembled. He [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2210.6000000000004s)]
*  found a fully intact gun in his security shack. And the Diddy cross-examination was basically, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2216.36s)]
*  you realize he's one of the most well-known figures in the world and people want to kill him. [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2221.48s)]
*  And yes, of course he would have an armed security guard around him, but let's not pretend Diddy is [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2225.7200000000003s)]
*  not a violent man. For the record, he denies these charges, but he's a violent man. We saw that on [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2230.44s)]
*  that tape. That's why the fact that it is on tape and the jury has seen the level of depravity [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2236.2000000000003s)]
*  that this man has when it comes to treating a fellow human being, another woman who's half [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2243.64s)]
*  his size and half his weight and totally powerless to stop him is so important. We don't have to [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2247.4s)]
*  wonder. He did it. We saw it. He started beating her shortly after they got together in 2007. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2253.2400000000002s)]
*  That's what the proof has been. And all the way through the videotape that we watched is 2016. [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2261.48s)]
*  That's almost 10 years later. Who that's empowered, who that has any sort of equality, [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2267.9599999999996s)]
*  nevermind equal strength in the relationship stays for nine years of beatings. I don't think [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2276.2s)]
*  they actually broke up until 2018. I mean, if you even just think about the humiliation that's [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2282.04s)]
*  involved and how regularly Sean Combs had been beating Cassie in front of other people that [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2288.6s)]
*  he thought nothing of beating her in a public space. Those elevators could have opened it [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2295.48s)]
*  anytime when that security guard shows up on that new footage that we've just seen. [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2299.8s)]
*  And I was listening to you talk about, cause I didn't realize this and it was so enlightening, [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2305.08s)]
*  you know, that's enough. So I'm like, okay, so a third party saw this and what happened, [[00:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2309.32s)]
*  what happened? And I believe it was the same security guy who was told we don't do anything [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2314.84s)]
*  about this. And he took video on his own phone of the video because he kind of knew it would [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2320.2s)]
*  disappear. He said he was going to show it to his wife, that he was going home on a Friday [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2326.7599999999998s)]
*  and he wanted to show it to his wife. And it was a good thing because by Monday, [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2331.72s)]
*  when he got back to work, it was gone. The original was gone. And thank God he did tape that, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2336.04s)]
*  you know, I mean, we never found out who was the source of this CNN leak. That's how we came to know [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2341.7999999999997s)]
*  that tape. CNN got their hands on it and aired it. And it was a game changer in the narrative [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2346.68s)]
*  around Diddy. But one presumes he got it from this guy. I mean, I don't know, but where else [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2351.48s)]
*  did it come from? It didn't come from Diddy. We know that, but thank God he got it because we don't, [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2357.56s)]
*  we don't have to wonder what kind of a man he is now. We don't have to wonder whether this is an [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2362.3599999999997s)]
*  Amber Heard, Johnny Depp situation. We know, we know what kind of a man he is and the evidence [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2365.8799999999997s)]
*  is overwhelming. And by the way, a source close to the case told me that it's not going to come [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2371.96s)]
*  down to Cassie because there's so much corroborating evidence that he was a serial abuser, bully, [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2377.7200000000003s)]
*  kingpin of what looked like a crime ring all around his desire to do drugs, to use [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2386.84s)]
*  illegal prostitutes, to run these freak offs and to bully. And another word is sex traffic. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2394.92s)]
*  His so-called love into being the star of his ill conceived sex romps, you know, by threatening [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2401.56s)]
*  her, by threatening her mom, by extorting her, by extorting her mom, by blowing up the cars of [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2411.4s)]
*  anybody she dared try to get away from him with. And by the way, to prove Rico back to the discussion [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2416.6s)]
*  of the elements and the crimes. So we discussed coercion, like sex trafficking by coercion, but [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2422.44s)]
*  the big, big claim against him count number one is Rico racketeering. And for that you have to show [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2427.72s)]
*  two underlying predicate acts they're called. It's two underlying crimes that your so-called [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2435.3999999999996s)]
*  mob boss or crime boss has committed or ordered committed in the context of this big crime [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2440.04s)]
*  organization. You're accusing him of running and typically it's used against crime bosses, [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2445.16s)]
*  but it's been used now in these more lurid sex cases too, like R Kelly. And there are many crimes [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2449.08s)]
*  you can show, but bribery, like offering that security guard a hundred thousand dollars to [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2456.76s)]
*  kill that tape. They've got testimony to prove bribery, kidnapping. We watched that on tape, [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2461.4s)]
*  assault. We watched that on tape. Obstruction of justice. There's been evidence of that too. I mean, [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2467.48s)]
*  just if you paid to have that tape described, destroyed, right? You know, another hotel worker [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2474.1200000000003s)]
*  arson, that was one of the ones alleged by the prosecution. And yesterday his defenders were [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2480.6000000000004s)]
*  pointing out that kid Cuddy didn't say, did he admitted it? Well, right. But there's something [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2485.32s)]
*  called circumstantial proof in a case. And we've now had Cassie testify that did he did it and [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2490.92s)]
*  did he do it? Did he did it? And, and, and we've then had kid Cuddy take the stand to say, [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2500.2000000000003s)]
*  he threatened me. I went home immediately. He had, I believe he had messed with my home and this is [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2506.76s)]
*  why I believe it. And I made a police report at the time. He threatened me again. Then my car was [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2512.92s)]
*  destroyed. I had a meeting with him. He said, I don't know what you're talking about. But then [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2518.04s)]
*  three years later, he apologized to me for some unspecified sin. I mean, that's enough for a jury [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2522.76s)]
*  to say, I believe he did it. I'm convinced. You know, it'd be enough for me as a juror, the dog, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2529.48s)]
*  you fucked with somebody's dog. You terrified a dog, you know, like your garbage. And the other [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2534.6s)]
*  thing about the Cassie stuff is, and you know, that the idea that it's, it's, it's implausible [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2540.6s)]
*  at best to believe that there aren't other female victims out there. You know, there's always been, [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2547.64s)]
*  so I'll be sure who was sort of a rapper who is involved in this because he was involved with Kim [[00:42:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2552.04s)]
*  Porter. Did he act who had several children with him has a book coming out in September. [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2558.36s)]
*  And there's always been speculation that Kim Porter's premature death at like 35 or 45 from [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2564.8399999999997s)]
*  pneumonia was extremely suspicious. Like a lot of eyebrows in the hip hop community have been raised. [[00:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2572.04s)]
*  I am extremely suspicious of it. I don't, I don't understand it. She's very young. It just so happens [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2577.56s)]
*  that the woman who is the mother to his children, winds up dead at a very young age of a, of an [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2584.04s)]
*  illness that doesn't normally kill 35 or 36 year olds. I'd like to know more. I would too. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2589.56s)]
*  And you know, there's the whole Tupac and Biggie Smalls, you know, those, I don't know what, if [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2595.48s)]
*  I'm not saying he necessarily committed those, but there's been a lot of speculation about, [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2602.12s)]
*  about what role, if any, he had in those too. Absolutely. It's no, it's no accident that after [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2605.48s)]
*  Biggie's death and Diddy back then was going by puffy and he was always sort of the sidekick, [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2611.96s)]
*  the producer trying to get in the frame as the star. Once Biggie died, who becomes the torch [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2618.36s)]
*  bearer? It's Diddy who becomes the new hip hop star. It's Diddy who begins like cannibalizing [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2625.48s)]
*  what little is left of the existing Biggie Smalls recordings. It's Diddy. And he made his bones on [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2631.6400000000003s)]
*  the back of a far more talented rapper. He just did. And I believe, I believe Biggie Smalls, [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2637.56s)]
*  his mother died within the past year or two, but I think she always had questions about that. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2643.8s)]
*  Mm hmm. The level of wealth with these music moguls dwarfs almost everything. I mean, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2648.36s)]
*  you think you're rich, like you think Julia Roberts is rich, right? 20, 25 million dollars [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2656.6800000000003s)]
*  a film. She's, she hasn't hold a candle to the ditties of the world. Like you want to make serious [[00:44:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2660.84s)]
*  F you money. You either run a hedge fund or you become a music mogul. You're talking like [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2666.36s)]
*  hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars, especially if you run the [[00:44:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2672.6s)]
*  label. If you're not just the talent, like it's those people who sign other people that make all [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2677.56s)]
*  the money. In fact, there was testimony from one of the gals who was part of this music group, [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2683.16s)]
*  Danity Kane. She took the stand and talked about the same thing, you know, how forgive me because [[00:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2687.48s)]
*  I don't want to screw it up, but I think she was one of the ones who testified how he was abusive [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2694.6s)]
*  and she, she witnessed it. There've been so many that I'm starting to lose track. I mean, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2698.52s)]
*  there've been multiple women now talking about having witnesses abused or experienced it firsthand. [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2703.24s)]
*  But she also talked about how they didn't make any money. Like he makes the money. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2708.7599999999998s)]
*  And this is a pattern in music, by the way, we'll wait to see whether that has any bearing on what [[00:45:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2712.68s)]
*  Justin Bieber's going through because he's had that manager, Scooter Braun that had that Taylor [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2717.7999999999997s)]
*  Swift had that she had the big dispute with. That's kind of an interesting question. But it's a [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2722.8399999999997s)]
*  pattern. It's a very exploitative industry, especially amongst those who own the record labels [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2727.4799999999996s)]
*  or who are the producers. And I just think like the mega F you money and the lifestyle and the [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2732.6s)]
*  trappings and the private jet and the huge estates and flying off to Jamaica or whatever, [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2739.72s)]
*  you know, tropical Island. He kept taking everybody to not to mention Epstein, similar pattern, [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2745.16s)]
*  right? People get intoxicated just at the whiff of it, Maureen, just at the whiff of it. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2749.88s)]
*  And it explains in some, in some, to some extent, their willingness to look the other way that plus [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2757.08s)]
*  he was a threatening guy. You know, the last time we were talking about this and you, you, you made [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2763.16s)]
*  a really great point that the kind of fame, first of all, the music industry is like, like, like the [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2768.92s)]
*  film industry, it can be incredibly predatory because you're dealing with people, you know, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2774.44s)]
*  the, the biggest sample size of the, of the wannabes are the people who would give an organ [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2779.72s)]
*  for it. Okay. They want it no matter the cost. They, you know, and, but you said something about [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2784.92s)]
*  the kind of charisma and star power that is unique to a famous musician, a live performer, [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2791.2400000000002s)]
*  and they're becoming more and more rare just because of the way the music industry is sort of, [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2799.4s)]
*  you know, auto tune. Yeah. Yeah. And like the way they come up now, like they don't come up the way [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2803.0s)]
*  they used to. And so the huge, huge stars like a Diddy, you know, who, who will now be in ruination [[00:46:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2807.16s)]
*  for the rest of his life. But, you know, I remember being like back when I worked at MTV [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2812.84s)]
*  as like a baby being at like this after party at like a very small New York city downtown club [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2816.6800000000003s)]
*  and the, and the room in the back that was like the quote VIP very, very small. And he walked in. [[00:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2822.6800000000003s)]
*  And when I tell you the gravitational pull in that room shifted, I mean, you could feel it before you [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2827.56s)]
*  even saw who came in. There is something about them that is just, I don't know if it's because [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2832.84s)]
*  they perform live and they develop in a connection with like an organism of a hundred thousand [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2838.76s)]
*  people in a stadium. That is a unique gift or Lady Gaga just had, was it 2 million people in London? [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2844.36s)]
*  It was, it was one or 2 million people at a free concert. She gave them like that's larger than life [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2851.5600000000004s)]
*  100%. And to make every person in that arena feel a connection with you, that, that is that, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2857.2400000000002s)]
*  that's power. That's power. And you can see when in thinking about how depraved Diddy became, [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2864.44s)]
*  you know, I, this was always my question with Harvey in the beginning. And I asked every guy [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2872.6s)]
*  I knew like, he could have anybody he wants for the most part, you know, favorite trade, whatever. [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2876.68s)]
*  Why rape? Why violence? And they would say, you're your baseline level of a dread, like it, [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2881.96s)]
*  you start topping out and you need more, you need more and more depravity to get a dopamine hit. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2887.2400000000002s)]
*  He needed to feel dirty. That's what got him off. But I would tell you like in a weird way, [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2892.2799999999997s)]
*  I, I understand the dynamic just because, you know, I've told the story about Roger Ailes and [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2896.8399999999997s)]
*  yours truly before, but it's very different, but in some ways similar. And just in that you have [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2902.4399999999996s)]
*  this hugely powerful boss, you know, hugely powerful person overseeing your career who is [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2908.52s)]
*  clearly trying to make, you know, sex with you, the stakes for your advancement. And unlike these [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2915.48s)]
*  women, you know, a lot of them, I had a very strong family background. I had an intact family. [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2923.0s)]
*  I lost my dad at a young age, but his imprint was already very secure on me and my ID was very [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2928.2s)]
*  strong and I couldn't be manipulated like that. Like I knew very clearly I was never going to do [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2932.84s)]
*  that, but the music industry praise on people who are vulnerable. I think generally people who are [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2937.32s)]
*  determined to become stars in music or acting are probably very damaged as a rule. And they're [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2944.6s)]
*  working something out. One of the reasons why they think they're going to get fulfilled by [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2949.7999999999997s)]
*  becoming a star and doing this thing. A lot of very talented people choose not to go into those [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2953.4s)]
*  industries because they're too, they're too healthy. And so they're ripe, they're ripe for [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2957.56s)]
*  the advantage taking. And that's why it's, it's one of the interesting things about the fact that [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2962.36s)]
*  the music industry never had its moment in the me too movement. It really never came under the [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2966.2s)]
*  microscope the way Hollywood did the way news did, you know, no one talked about like what [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2971.48s)]
*  happened backstage at Rolling Stones concerts or, you know, at a, at a Diddy concert or at a Kanye [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2977.8s)]
*  concert. All right. I got to take a break. There's so much more to discuss. Maureen's here [[00:49:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2985.88s)]

*  go and subscribe to the nerve with Maureen Callahan, wherever you get your podcast and go to [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2994.28s)]
*  sign up on YouTube as well. This July, there is a global summit of BRICS nations in Rio de [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=2998.68s)]

*  also helped come up with the name. There was a lot of discussion very lively and it was really fun. [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3074.92s)]
*  And yeah, they all like it. And, you know, it's like this show is so much fun on so many levels [[00:51:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3081.08s)]
*  and it's so much fun to do it. And it's the same thing when I'm with you, like every time I come on [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3087.72s)]
*  your show, you know, we finished a conversation and I turned, I'm like, that was an hour. It feels like [[00:51:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3091.8s)]
*  15 minutes and it feels the same way doing the nerve. It feels like 15 minutes. And if I just [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3096.7599999999998s)]
*  want 15 more and 15, you know, I've gotten so many nice notes from people saying, basically you've [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3100.84s)]
*  changed my listening and viewing habits of news now. Like they're listening to you. They're [[00:51:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3107.4s)]
*  listening to Halpern or they're listening to link. And like these are new voices who they [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3112.28s)]
*  only heard occasionally who they're now addicted to. I don't think he'll mind me saying, but Glenn [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3116.36s)]
*  Greenwald sent me a note saying, thank you for introducing me to this wonderful creature about [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3120.84s)]
*  you. He loves the show. Oh, it just goes to show you even people who are totally hard news, you [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3125.4s)]
*  know, hard nose news people can, you know, we all need an escape and some fun and like some [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3131.4s)]
*  salacious gossip every once in a while. 100%. And my favorite feedback, which like is like so [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3137.0s)]
*  like truly humbling is like people who write and say, you know, I moved to, I moved to a new town [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3143.88s)]
*  and I feel lonely. I don't have friends, but like I tune into your channel and I look at you talking [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3150.04s)]
*  to me. It's like a FaceTime with a friend. You know, it's like that kind of stuff where it's like, [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3154.1200000000003s)]
*  it just feels very communal and like we're all having, we're all seeing the same thing. [[00:52:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3158.28s)]
*  And we're all like now just being able to say like, yeah, this is all nuts. This is all nuts. [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3163.1600000000003s)]
*  When I watch the show, I constantly find myself saying my daughter's favorite word, which is [[00:52:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3167.0800000000004s)]
*  real. That's what the kids say now. When you say something that's true, real, real. And we pulled [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3172.92s)]
*  a clip from the nerve, the latest show. And I said it after this, here is Maureen talking about [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3180.36s)]
*  all the lies that Hollywood's most beautiful women tell us about how it was just an effortless [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3186.6s)]
*  course to such beauty. And this one is about Jennifer Aniston. Here it is. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3193.16s)]
*  Jennifer Aniston, one of the most beloved celebrities in the country. She does it too. [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3197.4s)]
*  She lies about it from an in style magazine article in 2024. Oh, Jen, you know, she just [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3204.12s)]
*  like drinks a lot of water and she gets a lot of rest and she eats really well. She eats really [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3210.12s)]
*  clean. Okay. I'm going to tell you guys firsthand that I have, I know a doctor who recently worked [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3215.08s)]
*  with somebody very close to Jennifer Aniston, that Jennifer Aniston recently had what is called a [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3224.2s)]
*  bilateral, what's it called? It's a bilateral like lower facelift. So they go in with cameras on both [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3229.4s)]
*  sides, like under the cheekbones and they go in and they just lift here. They just lift here. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3237.24s)]
*  And what it winds up doing is it winds up stretching the mouth out like that. [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3242.6s)]
*  And you can't reverse it. And it's a bad procedure to have done no matter who you are, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3247.4s)]
*  no matter what your bone structure is, because it's not working with the rest of the face. [[00:54:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3254.52s)]
*  We have to try that. Hold on a second. Does it look good? [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3260.52s)]
*  Yeah, it looks great. Yeah, it never looked better. Also, people are getting their top lip [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3264.68s)]
*  flipped up. They're getting their lip flipped up. It's like the attempt to do the [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3269.08s)]
*  Kylie Kardashian big lip, but without huge injections. And it looks terrible. Don't mess [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3273.7999999999997s)]
*  with your lips. No, especially like the space between your nose and your- Kylie Jenner. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3279.48s)]
*  Kylie Jenner, Lauren Sanchez. Oh. Lauren Sanchez. I don't know. She needs to step away, [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3283.72s)]
*  step away from the needles. There was a picture of her in Paris that was published recently that was [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3289.4s)]
*  horrifying because it gets to the point where they do so much pulling and stretching and [[00:54:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3294.6s)]
*  filler and Botox. I feel like they lose any sort of tissue and you just see skin on bone. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3299.0s)]
*  Well, and then you know what you get, not to be cruel, but you get some weird bumpiness. [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3305.16s)]
*  Yes. Have you seen it? [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3309.2400000000002s)]
*  Yes. There's some weird bumpiness that [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3310.2000000000003s)]
*  it's almost like the tell. I think that they've had a facelift or I don't know, [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3312.52s)]
*  is that filler left? I don't know what that is. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3315.4s)]
*  I don't know what that is, but my doctor friend who can diagnose this stuff a mile away [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3317.56s)]
*  is always sort of like that. So that thing that Jen Aniston had, she said- [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3322.52s)]
*  Allegedly. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3326.28s)]
*  Allegedly had is not reversible. There's no doctor you can go to now. Allegedly. Remember [[00:55:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3327.0s)]
*  when Demi Moore did that? It was horrifying. [[00:55:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3333.56s)]
*  Horrifying. And her face was like- [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3336.2s)]
*  It was like Balenciaga or something like that. Yes. And she looked like an alien, like her cheek. So [[00:55:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3337.72s)]
*  my doctor friend told me, I thought that was misdone filler. It was a botched facelift. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3341.96s)]
*  And she said everybody in their community knows the doctor in New York City, allegedly, [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3347.0s)]
*  who did that to her and knows the doctor in New York City, allegedly, who fixed it. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3351.24s)]
*  I mean, you have to. I can't believe she went out and about in the world with that terrible [[00:55:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3355.48s)]
*  facelift. I mean, it looked awful. I don't know. I think Demi Moore is probably like [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3360.76s)]
*  kind of addicted to all the plastic surgeries because there have been so many reports about [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3366.68s)]
*  doing the arms and doing the legs and doing the crotch and you can get all the, I mean, [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3370.68s)]
*  not crotch specifically, but you remember when she came out, was it for GI Jane or whatever, [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3374.92s)]
*  but she kind of had a resurgence after a low period in her career and she looked 15 years younger. [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3379.16s)]
*  And there are all these reports, which she denied. They never confirmed them that she'd [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3385.64s)]
*  had everything operated. I like hikes in the arms and hikes in the legs and hikes. I don't know. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3389.24s)]
*  A friend of mine had the leg lifted like the leg so that the knees don't look old. [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3393.08s)]
*  And she said, don't get that because she said, she laughingly said, I've got such bad scars now, [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3399.08s)]
*  unlike my bikini line that I can never ever leave my husband. Oh my God. Or like wear a bathing suit [[00:56:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3406.04s)]
*  that doesn't have like a matronly skirt. Right. Or like the boy shorts now only, I guess. Oh my God. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3413.8s)]
*  She was, she's very open about what she's had done and she had me in hysterics talking about this. [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3420.84s)]
*  Oh my God. But anyway, this nonsense of it's just my water, that is a bridge too far. I love it. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3425.0s)]
*  And in that segment, I closed with my favorite example of recent years, which was Giselle Burke, [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3431.6400000000003s)]
*  Giselle Burke. Giselle in a burka outside her a burka, a head to toe burka outside her plastic [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3436.12s)]
*  surgeon's office in Paris. Yes. Okay. And then five years later, she, you know, she, she issues [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3445.16s)]
*  all these like cookbooks and like, you know, I'm, I'm so pure and everything's pure and I ride horses [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3450.52s)]
*  and it's just the sun and my athleticism and it's not, it's not, it's such a line of bullshit they [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3455.64s)]
*  sell to women and I hate it. It makes it's designed to make us all feel terrible about ourselves. [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3460.8399999999997s)]
*  That's right. And their own, they won't own their own insecurities and confess it, right? [[00:57:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3464.76s)]
*  They just just born that way. So on the knees, you know, as you get older, of course your skin does, [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3469.2400000000002s)]
*  does start to drape and the knees are a tell. And I recently saw a picture of Cindy Crawford [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3474.6800000000003s)]
*  and one of Melania Trump where they both have the knee like starting to sag. And I thought, thank God, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3479.1600000000003s)]
*  you know, it makes you feel better. I have it too. I did, I did like three years ago have a laser [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3485.4s)]
*  tried out on my knee. Yeah. My Derm was like, yeah, you know, we could try that. I'm like, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3491.96s)]
*  okay, sure. It hurts so badly. She gave me nitrous oxide while she was, I had to go on laughing gas. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3496.04s)]
*  It hurt like a mofo. It did make the knee look better. I'm not going to lie, but then it goes [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3501.64s)]
*  right back. You know, you can do amazing things with lasers these days. I had a recent laser, [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3507.56s)]
*  I'm going to say maybe six months ago. And I was like, I have a pretty high pain tolerance. [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3511.96s)]
*  And this thing, I, this was, this was killing me. It was killing. I was like, they were like, [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3517.56s)]
*  well, next time we could give you value. And I was like, you should have started with that. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3520.92s)]
*  Yeah. Right. Why did you hold out? See, that's what I love. I love the lasers and I recommend [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3523.56s)]
*  the lasers and I strongly oppose filler. You just look weird. It just makes you look weird. It [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3528.36s)]
*  doesn't make you look younger. By the way, there's no woman who's stuffed up with filler, who you're [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3532.92s)]
*  like, oh, she's 30 when she's 50. Nobody thinks that. No. And I think you have to go to a doctor. [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3537.08s)]
*  I love my Derm because she's like, if you want something and I think it's too much or wrong for [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3542.2000000000003s)]
*  you, I'm going to say no. And I'm going to say no again. And somebody else, you know, because I do [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3547.08s)]
*  think you can, once you start, it's like when you're renovating a house, right? Once you start [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3551.96s)]
*  seeing what's wrong and got corrected, all you can see sometimes are imperfections, you know, [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3555.7999999999997s)]
*  and your skin is like so like, I'm like kind of in awe of like how you're, you know, and I love [[00:59:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3560.84s)]
*  that you're open about lasers and extensions and like all this stuff. Like, yes, I will say well [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3565.88s)]
*  done filler. Like I have gotten filler under my eyes for maybe the past five years. And it can, [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3570.92s)]
*  if it's done well, it can really correct. Like if you're beginning to feel like you're losing a [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3576.68s)]
*  hollowed out a little bit, but the side effect of it is that you don't really need concealer anymore. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3581.3199999999997s)]
*  It gets rid of the dark circle. Now you're talking to me. Wait, does it hurt to get needles and that [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3587.08s)]
*  really? No, you just get numbed up. You just get numbed up and you wait 30 minutes. Such an artist. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3592.3599999999997s)]
*  She's a genius. Oh, what can I say? Dr. Jessica Weiser in Soho. Okay. Very nice. She got the [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3597.96s)]
*  shout out. Well, I do love the lasers and I told the audience, I try to get two fraxels a year once [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3603.72s)]
*  every six months. And honestly, I just had one. I just had one last week. You couldn't even tell. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3608.52s)]
*  I was on the air. You couldn't tell that I had post-fraxel. You don't really have much downtime. [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3612.12s)]
*  You don't. If you, if you don't go like too crazy with it. And then in between the fraxels, [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3616.12s)]
*  I'll have this little, it's called a Pico and a clear and brilliant from time to time. It's nothing. [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3620.2s)]
*  I mean, it's a nothing burger. There's no downtime. It doesn't hurt. I don't even know really if it [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3625.48s)]
*  does anything, to be honest, but I do think these are the reasons that my skin stays looking good. [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3629.48s)]
*  And that way more than like filling in lines gives you, I think a more youthful appearance. [[01:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3633.56s)]
*  Right. And it's not invasive. You know, I'm never going to get that crazy ass, [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3638.52s)]
*  your bloody faced for 10 weeks or a one month. I can't remember, but I remember it was, um, [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3642.52s)]
*  the OT, the O2 anyway, CO, CO2 laser where the doctor, I had a new Derm. And she was like, [[01:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3649.4s)]
*  have you ever had that? And I'm like, no. And she goes, is that something you'd be interested in? [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3655.64s)]
*  And I was like, I don't know. Should I be? She goes, well, do you have young children? [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3659.48s)]
*  I'm like, well, I have children. Why? She was like, you basically couldn't see them for like [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3663.72s)]
*  three weeks. So I'm sure you got it. I'll come back when I'm 70. Yeah. Yeah. So no, I only like [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3668.84s)]
*  the ones that there's really not a lot of downtime on and they work great. They do work great. And I [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3676.68s)]
*  also love, I love like my aging goals are women who age gracefully. Like, I don't know if you've [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3680.92s)]
*  watched Emily in Paris. I don't know. Okay. There's this older French actress who's on that show. She [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3687.64s)]
*  is so stylish and she is so cool. And she's so obviously in her mid fifties, she has lines, [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3692.76s)]
*  her skin is kind of sagging, but she has so much confidence and so much style. You're just like, [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3698.84s)]
*  I want to be her. I want to be that person. I don't want to be the person who looked like [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3703.7200000000003s)]
*  it came from a wind tunnel, you know, when I'm like 60 years old, like I don't want that. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3706.84s)]
*  No, and like even Jane Fonda, it's like too much. I don't want to cut into my face when I'm 80. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3710.6800000000003s)]
*  I'm watching this series, which I highly recommend by the way, if you don't have Brit box, [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3717.88s)]
*  you can get it on Amazon prime. And it's so fun. It's got British crime series and Doug and I love [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3722.2799999999997s)]
*  that stuff. Yeah. So we just finished watching I like the pronoun I comma Jack, right? W R I G H T. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3727.24s)]
*  So good. Six episodes. I have to warn you. They do wind it up on episode six, but not fully. So [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3735.48s)]
*  you don't have that like everything is explained feeling, but didn't change my thorough enjoyment [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3742.12s)]
*  of every episode. Notwithstanding that fact and in it, one of the stars is for me, I should [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3747.4s)]
*  remember her name. I think it's Gemma. Is it Gemma Jones? She started in sense and sensibility as [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3753.8s)]
*  the mother of the two young women. And she starred in Bridget Jones diary as a Bridget Jones mom. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3758.36s)]
*  You'd know her in a heartbeat if you saw her and she's an older woman. Now she's, you know, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3766.28s)]
*  elderly. She looks great. She's beautiful. She's old. You're allowed to age in great Britain in a [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3770.28s)]
*  way you're not here. Yes. And this is how I want to look when I am in my eighties, like an, like a [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3776.36s)]
*  pretty 80 something year old who is old, but like attractive. There's an elegance in not doing that [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3782.1200000000003s)]
*  to yourself. Yes. The level it's, it's, it's a, it shows a level of self-confidence and it shows [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3789.4s)]
*  like we all want to look at. Most of us really want to look our best, but like it shows, it also [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3795.32s)]
*  shows a sense of humility. You know, time comes for us all. Yeah. Age comes for us all. Yeah. [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3799.6400000000003s)]
*  You know, and you could be Jane Fonda and you could go out in a wig allegedly and pull your [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3804.2s)]
*  face back, but you're still 80, 85, you know, like we all know that we all know it. Meanwhile, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3808.3599999999997s)]
*  Doug and I were laughing because he only goes to the Derm for like skin cancer removal stuff, [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3815.0s)]
*  you know, and he's so the opposite of me. He went and had like whatever removed from his face and [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3820.6s)]
*  they put a bandaid on his temple and he went and did his show dedicated with Doug Brun with the [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3827.48s)]
*  side that had the bandaid facing camera. I like Doug. I would never, no, never. He has no vanities [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3833.64s)]
*  like, Oh, well it's very different from, from me. Okay. Let's keep going. Cause there's so many [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3841.64s)]
*  good things in the news that I want to get to. We mentioned Lauren Sanchez. She posted, or no, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3846.8399999999997s)]
*  she didn't post. She was in the tabloids for this picture of Jeff Bezos smacking her thong wearing [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3852.8399999999997s)]
*  bottom on their yachts. This is, I submit to you a total setup with the paparazzi because there's [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3860.28s)]
*  another one of her with her arms up, stretching, showing off the backside with the thong up the [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3866.6000000000004s)]
*  rear. She totally either knew they were there or set it up and she's prancing around Paris. [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3873.0800000000004s)]
*  Here's some pictures of him smacking her bottom. Okay. You're young and virulent. Jeff Bezos. Look, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3879.48s)]
*  look at this with her in the bottom, right? That is totally posed. And then you've got these [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3885.24s)]
*  pictures of her ridiculous bachelorette party prancing around Paris. I've never seen Katy Perry [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3891.3199999999997s)]
*  look worse. She goes out, Katy Perry, there's, she was caught by the tabloids walking out of her hotel [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3898.2s)]
*  with like, there's no bra on Maureen. She's wearing like, I don't know what this getup is. It's like a [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3904.04s)]
*  leotard with pantyhose. It's almost like Bianca Sensori-esque, where there's very little clothing. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3910.76s)]
*  Like the time, as you said, comes for us all. And when you're past a certain age, you need a bra. [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3918.0400000000004s)]
*  Sorry, but you do. You know, especially if you've had children, which I believe she has, [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3924.5200000000004s)]
*  because things are supposed to be pointing straight out, start to be pointing down. [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3929.48s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes, yes. [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3933.1600000000003s)]
*  Most of us will wear appropriate clothing so that we're not drawing too much attention [[01:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3935.2400000000002s)]
*  to these issues. But Katy Perry seems to be going through a midlife crisis. [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3938.92s)]
*  A 100%. [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3942.12s)]
*  This is one of the few times I feel ashamed to be an American. These are Americans, Bulgarians, [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3944.84s)]
*  parading through Paris. I read they went to a restaurant called Lafayette and they ordered a [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3951.8s)]
*  bunch of like gross American food that was probably not on the menu. Just to call back to the Diddy [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3956.12s)]
*  thing, one of the most disgusting details to come out this week. He prefers his burgers with [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3960.52s)]
*  applesauce. I know, I know. It's disgusting. Who came up with that? For him it is. It's [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3965.08s)]
*  disgusting. But anyway, these two that that image of Bezos slapping, like that reminded me of the [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3971.7999999999997s)]
*  Jenny from the block video. Remember Ben Affleck on the boat slapping? Oh my gosh. Like, and I [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3977.4s)]
*  think they're trying to reenact this, this thing. But my main theory about Lauren Sanchez is I think [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3981.88s)]
*  she is paying a very high price to become the next Mrs. Jeff Bezos. I do not think this is fun at all. [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3987.4s)]
*  I think she has to keep her body in a certain condition. I think she has to have a certain [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3993.8s)]
*  number of surgeries. I think she has to look a certain way. My opinion, just my opinion, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=3998.6000000000004s)]
*  it is Jeff Bezos is revenge of the nerds, small dude syndrome. Like I have a pneumatic sex doll. [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4004.04s)]
*  Totally. And I parade her around and she does what I want. And that visual right there, [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4009.96s)]
*  I'm smacking her bottom. Isn't it a little Kanye, Bianca-esque? Yes. I agree with you 100%. [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4015.2400000000002s)]
*  Kind of a couple of parallels there. So speaking of our fellow astronauts, [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4022.68s)]
*  Gail King is suffering some blowback from her trip to space and not just in the form of blonde [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4026.7599999999998s)]
*  origin, which you must check out on our YouTube channel if you have not yet seen it. It is our [[01:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4033.64s)]
*  full parody of the blue origin debacle and the moronic narcissistic women who were on that ride. [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4037.3199999999997s)]
*  But in the news today is, let me get on it because I want to quote from it, is the fact that [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4046.12s)]
*  there's blowback against Gail and others at CBS for that absurdity. Hold on a second. Was that [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4052.68s)]
*  in the AM update, you guys? Like our real AM update? Oh, wait, this is the, I've got the wrong [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4060.2799999999997s)]
*  paper in front of me. Sorry. I have so many papers when I come to air that I sometimes screw it up. [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4064.2s)]
*  I'm going to find it. Oh, that's so many papers. And so little time. Here. I think I found it. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4069.7999999999997s)]
*  It's the Daily Mail. Okay. First of all, CBS news is imploding. They fired Wendy McMahon, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4076.12s)]
*  the president, the executive producer of CBS of 60 minutes quit. Now there are rumors that both [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4085.64s)]
*  Gail and Scott Peli could be on the way out. There was a report the other day that Gail was told [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4093.88s)]
*  they are not paying her her $10 million salary anymore. She has no viewers. It's not worth it. [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4099.96s)]
*  And, you know, she's not going to work for free Maureen, like for 7 million. These are the reports, [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4107.16s)]
*  but now there's this via the Daily Mail inside the vicious CBS news blood bath where staff are [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4112.76s)]
*  fighting, crying and resent Gail King. Tensions are running particularly high about reports that [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4118.12s)]
*  CBS's parent company Paramount is preparing to slash 500 million in costs in preparation for the [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4123.8s)]
*  lucrative merger with Skydance Media against the backdrop of a ratings freefall. And there might be [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4129.4800000000005s)]
*  more exits to come. Multiple sources told the Daily Mail that 60 minutes host Scott Peli could [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4135.24s)]
*  be on the way out. It's marquee name after marquee name. I mean, let's not kid ourselves. There are [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4140.360000000001s)]
*  no marquee names there. People don't want to say it out loud in the office, but the entire space [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4145.88s)]
*  debacle really hurt us. Oh, did it? Said a 60 minute staffer. Gail being part of that, [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4151.72s)]
*  not a good look for our brand. You know what? You should have listened to us because we could have [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4160.84s)]
*  told you that immediately. I think a lot of people resent Gail for it. I know I do, but the most [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4166.04s)]
*  that's them, not me. But the most palpable impact appears to have been felt at 60 minutes where [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4172.4400000000005s)]
*  staff have compared the atmosphere to a sinking ship. The tension spilling out into the open with [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4176.92s)]
*  blazing rows in the office, rows in the office over story coverage and petty squabbles concerning [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4181.24s)]
*  seating plans. Sources told the Daily Mail fights and loud ones, said the insider. You can hear them [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4188.04s)]
*  in the halls. People are arguing over everything and anything from big things like how to report [[01:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4194.44s)]
*  stories to small things like who is sitting where in the conference room. So it's not going well. [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4198.599999999999s)]
*  It's not going well. I have two Scott Peli observations and then I'd like to say something [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4204.28s)]
*  about Gail. Scott Peli once assailed a page six reporter who dared to talk to him back when I was [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4209.72s)]
*  the post on the red carpet. He was on a red carpet. He was doing interviews. I believe he had just [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4217.4800000000005s)]
*  been canned as anchor, nightly news anchor. And they had the temerity to ask him about that. [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4221.72s)]
*  And he's spat, he fairly spat at them like, you wouldn't last two minutes inside the halls of CBS [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4226.76s)]
*  news. And I'm like, Scott Peli wouldn't last two minutes inside the New York Post newsroom. [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4233.8s)]
*  Oh, hell no. [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4237.56s)]
*  Promise you. Okay. And then my other thing about Scott Peli is, you know, he's on 60 minutes now [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4238.120000000001s)]
*  and he's always talking like a lockjaw. And then he does have a lockjaw. He does this and then he [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4242.6s)]
*  takes his glasses and he'll put them on like this. And then after he asks the question, he takes them [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4247.0s)]
*  off. He writes it like this. It's like William Hurt and broadcast news. Thank you. It's very cathartic [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4250.84s)]
*  to get that out. Very cathartic. And then so Gail, I feel like Gail is to CBS news what Don Lemon was [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4255.8s)]
*  to CNN. And I knew Don Lemon was over before he began tanking. Do you remember that image of him [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4263.0s)]
*  on a red carpet during fashion week? It was right around COVID. I'm sure I blocked it out. [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4268.84s)]
*  He's on a red carpet. There are photographers like in a semi-circle. He's standing there in [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4274.12s)]
*  like a $5,000 suit with like a $10,000 coat caped over him. And he's showing his hands like this and [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4278.84s)]
*  all the rings on his fingers. And I was like, this guy thinks he's a major star and CNN is the [[01:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4284.68s)]
*  backdrop rather than you're the journalist and that is your outlet. And Gail's right now in the [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4290.76s)]
*  same level of delusion. She's the star and CBS is just lucky to have her, my opinion. Can I tell you [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4295.64s)]
*  something else that happened at the time 100? This is an amazing moment. So, you know, you have to [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4301.24s)]
*  wait in the line to get your red shot, your red carpet shot. And I was going to get that red [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4305.08s)]
*  carpet shot because that was the reason to be there. You know, like I just felt like it was an [[01:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4311.64s)]
*  F you bitches moment to like my old pals at NBC. It was just kind of nice from that standpoint. [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4315.24s)]
*  So I was waiting and we were in front of, we were right behind. I am forget, you know, I don't, [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4319.72s)]
*  I know nothing about the music industry, which I'm learning as I try to talk about the D the [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4326.76s)]
*  Diddy trial, but I know very little, but a big star, a big music star and his wife. And we'd all [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4330.76s)]
*  been waiting our turn, but this guy, forgive me for not knowing his name, but he was like the marquee [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4338.4400000000005s)]
*  talent for the night and everybody knew who he was, but not me. No, it wasn't miles Smith. It was [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4342.280000000001s)]
*  another guy. Keep going. No, it wasn't Ed Sheeran. No, it wasn't Ed Sheeran. It was a different guy. [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4346.68s)]
*  Anyway, whatever. Okay. They stopped. So we're all filing in from the left of the red carpet [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4351.72s)]
*  and waiting in line. I was in behind Priyanka Chopra. Right? So she's pretty well known. [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4360.68s)]
*  Everyone's waiting as we inch up and it's almost like our time to go out there. They stop our [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4367.8s)]
*  procession from the left side because clearly some big star is coming over from the right. [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4374.44s)]
*  I'm like, what is it? Tom Cruise? Who is it? It's going to be like somebody. We'd all be like, [[01:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4379.879999999999s)]
*  Oh, of course. Yeah. Okay. Fine. You know, security demands that they get in and get out. [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4383.96s)]
*  It was fucking David Muir. Get the fuck out. David Muir who, by the way, you know, like Mariah Carey [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4388.679999999999s)]
*  is only ever shot from one side. Once you see it, you can't unsee it. Yeah. He's only, so he's, [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4396.36s)]
*  and he's that way. Oh, he's that way. No, he's, so this is, so he sits at the anchor desk like this [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4402.6s)]
*  and he never moves. He's like a statue. He knows. So, and then what's great is when he has to [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4407.72s)]
*  parachute into a war zone or a natural disaster, you better fucking get him from this side only. [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4411.320000000001s)]
*  Doesn't matter how many dead bodies are in the background. This side, this side. [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4416.360000000001s)]
*  Bring my waist sink shirt. Oh, right. I couldn't believe I'm like, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4419.400000000001s)]
*  David Muir, you've got to be kidding me. That is such an insult to you, Megan. And it's such an [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4425.08s)]
*  insult to me. It was, but it was an absurdity by him. I mean, honestly, like he should have been [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4430.36s)]
*  embarrassed. Everybody was expecting some truly A-list talent to come in there and we were all [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4436.679999999999s)]
*  like, David Muir. Everybody in line was like, you've got to be fucking kidding me. Just the [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4441.88s)]
*  fact that he would do it is kind of humiliating, but he did it. Okay. So that was that. Okay. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4447.16s)]
*  Oh, Scott Peli. We can't leave this subject without showing you Scott Peli at Wake Forest. [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4453.5599999999995s)]
*  I don't know why Wake Forest would invite Scott Peli and sick him on their graduates with, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4458.6s)]
*  as you accurately point out, I've never heard it said right. Like you did lock jaw. He does have [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4462.92s)]
*  the lock jaw. That's not happening with the glasses. So here he goes to speak to these poor [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4469.72s)]
*  graduates who are his captive audience. And keep in mind, when you hear this clip of the free speech [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4474.6s)]
*  crackdowns that we suffered during COVID under Joe Biden, right? When he took over and how we got [[01:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4481.0s)]
*  censored. If we said, try ivermectin or hydroxychloroquine, or if you said COVID started [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4488.2s)]
*  in a lab and it wasn't natural origin. If you said it's causing serious side effects like [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4495.32s)]
*  myocarditis, all of the crackdowns, right? That we've had on free speech, the disinformation dozen, [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4501.48s)]
*  where they actively worked with social media to censor regular Americans, where he sick the FBI on [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4507.56s)]
*  parents at school board meetings, if they were saying the wrong things. And now, [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4512.68s)]
*  now is the time Scott Peli would like to throw a word out there for free speech and listen to [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4518.280000000001s)]
*  him do it. But in this moment, this moment, this morning, our sacred rule of law is under attack. [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4524.360000000001s)]
*  Journalism is under attack. Universities are under attack. Freedom of speech is under attack. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4535.08s)]
*  And insidious fear is reaching through our schools, our businesses, our homes, [[01:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4545.96s)]
*  and into our private thoughts. The fear to speak [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4559.24s)]
*  in America. The Wake Forest class of 1861, they did not choose their time of calling. The class of [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4566.759999999999s)]
*  1941 did not choose the class of 1968 did not choose history chose them. [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4575.72s)]
*  And now history is calling you the class of 2025. [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4587.400000000001s)]
*  So that's the Civil War, World War Two and civil rights movement. That's what that's the same [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4593.88s)]
*  moment we're in now, as free speech is under attack. And universities are under attack and [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4598.92s)]
*  somebody's private thoughts are filled with fear, I believe he speaks of himself. And that's his [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4605.24s)]
*  inspirational message to the class of 2025 at Wake Forest University. He seems like a fun time, [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4612.2s)]
*  doesn't he? Good job. That's exactly what I want to hear as I'm going out into the world [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4617.0s)]
*  and about to embark on my life. And it should be the most optimistic, hopeful time. And those are [[01:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4620.52s)]
*  I'll say this, like my commencement speech speaker, you may be surprised was Cornell West and I [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4624.759999999999s)]
*  freaking loved his speech. He was so great. And it was so joyful. And he was like, you're going [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4629.48s)]
*  out into the world and it's like all yours. And like, it was just amazing. You know, it was so [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4634.36s)]
*  inspirational. And he really captivated everybody. And this is like, okay, there's no free speech. [[01:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4639.16s)]
*  You're talking to kids who are running college campuses as they see fit. You want to tend to [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4644.04s)]
*  father have it. Yeah. What is he talking about? Yeah. Well, and it's just so ironic. It's like, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4649.08s)]
*  universities are under attack as the federal government tries to enforce title six, which [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4654.36s)]
*  doesn't allow open displays of anti-Semitism on campus. It's literally the law that they must step [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4661.0s)]
*  in. If a college allows Jews, for example, to be openly harassed, like Columbia has like Harvard has. [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4669.0s)]
*  It's just that nobody else would enforce these laws prior to Trump. Right. And now he's upset [[01:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4676.68s)]
*  because he doesn't like that. But by the way, where was he when the federal government was [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4682.28s)]
*  an interfering, like I say, with parents trying to protect their children, when the federal [[01:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4687.0s)]
*  government was interfering with police departments across this country who had done nothing wrong, [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4691.88s)]
*  but were getting harassed by president Obama and then president Biden setting up fake consent [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4697.88s)]
*  degrees to try to make them answer to Joe Biden in their law enforcement or Barack Obama in their [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4703.56s)]
*  law enforcement, which thank God, Harmeet Dhillon, now deputy at the DOJ has just undone. He didn't [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4708.4400000000005s)]
*  care. He wanted them scrutinized. He wanted government interference then when it ran right [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4713.96s)]
*  in line with his own ideology. For that matter, where was Scott Pelley and his ilk as all of the [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4718.360000000001s)]
*  stuff we're learning about now, when the press was either complicit in or very happy to be told, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4725.96s)]
*  everything's fine here, vis a vis Joe Biden. Right. Nothing to see here. Now we're learning [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4731.4s)]
*  in that Jake Tapper book, Hunter Biden was one of the people making crucial decisions. Right. Like [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4736.5199999999995s)]
*  that was the punchline. Oh, who do you think it is behind the scenes? Is it like Hunter, that [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4742.28s)]
*  degenerate? Yeah, it was. It was Hunter and Jill. And Jill, who's really emerging as one of the [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4746.2s)]
*  worst, most terrible first ladies in US history. 100%. It was interesting, I have to say, to see [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4751.32s)]
*  Sally Quinn of the Washington Post and was married to Ben Bradley, the famous, famous editor of the [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4756.76s)]
*  Washington Post for many years and who he was much older than she was. That's why she's still around [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4761.88s)]
*  and got dementia. So she does know a thing or two about being married to an elderly, [[01:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4767.0s)]
*  somewhat infirm man, at least he was in his later years. He was a giant of the press when he was [[01:19:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4771.400000000001s)]
*  younger. And then she went on this podcast with Tara Palmieri and listened to what she said in [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4776.04s)]
*  SOT 8. Well, honestly, I blame Jill Biden for this. Jill Biden is his wife. And if Jill Biden [[01:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4782.6s)]
*  has stood up and has gone to him and said, Joe, you can't do it. And if you do, you're on your own, [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4791.64s)]
*  I'm out. He wouldn't have run because he couldn't have done it without her support. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4796.6s)]
*  And, you know, she clearly was in favor of him running. And I just think it was a terrible [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4801.96s)]
*  disservice to the country. I felt sorry for Joe Biden because I didn't think she was protecting [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4808.04s)]
*  him. She wasn't protecting him from himself. And after that hideous debate, right after the debate, [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4813.32s)]
*  they're in the spin room and she got his hand up and they're victory, victory. We won. We won. It [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4821.08s)]
*  was great. Right. The next day he's up in North Carolina and making a victory speech. I thought, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4826.2s)]
*  what were they watching? It was, I thought it was just elder abuse, really, what they were [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4831.08s)]
*  paying for. I think everybody was horrified that he was put in a position where he was allowed to [[01:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4838.04s)]
*  run by the staff and by his wife. And I felt sorry for him. So even she, now even the left is trying [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4846.04s)]
*  to, is starting to come to terms with the fact that this looked very much like elder abuse by [[01:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4855.64s)]
*  Jill Biden. Yes. You know, it's so galling that, okay, there's she and Joe went on the view like [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4860.36s)]
*  two weeks ago and they knew this book was coming out. So, you know, Joe's trying to shore up his [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4868.36s)]
*  legacy as one of the greatest presidents ever and losing his train of thought as he does. So he's [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4875.08s)]
*  like, right. And Jill's grabbing him going, well, let me just tell you that he was working 24 hours [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4880.2s)]
*  a day and, you know, he's reading his briefing books and he's taking phone calls and I'm in bed [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4887.64s)]
*  with my novel, but there he is. And he's just, you know, blah, blah, blah. And it's all a lie. We all [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4891.0s)]
*  know it's a lie. You know, and then of course they make the announcement about the cancer diagnosis, [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4894.280000000001s)]
*  like two days before the Tapper book is like officially published, but most of the media has [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4898.68s)]
*  seen it and like is talking about it. And it's so disgustingly cynical. And then, so the view [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4903.160000000001s)]
*  after they allow this pro-vda-esque display at their table and they're happy to do it because [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4911.240000000001s)]
*  they're all team Joe, right? Team Jill, team Dr. Jill. So Bob Iger reportedly, and then the head [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4916.36s)]
*  of ABC news have a come to Jesus meeting with them, the host of the view, this brain trust. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=4922.44s)]

*  garden. But it's not the season for tomatoes. You're going to put that in the pan. Just lay [[01:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5265.96s)]

*  girls. Green pearls, girls. So where'd you grow up? I'm from originally Los Angeles. And then, [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5276.92s)]
*  you know, by way of Northwestern wound up back in Los Angeles. Oh, okay. Yeah. I just came back [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5289.4800000000005s)]
*  here because I have a natural connection to it. What I really wanted to do was direct my lifestyle [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5293.96s)]
*  blog, time on Deal or No Deal, in which I was obviously the most coveted, looked after model. [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5298.68s)]
*  And then, ultimately, I moved on to acting. After that, I met Dee. We fell in love. I became a [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5303.8s)]
*  princess. I moved into a cat. Maureen. Sorry, sorry, sorry. It's a lot. I just can't absorb [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5309.4s)]
*  the enormity of your life. I don't even know how you put it. Maybe you should put the drink down [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5316.04s)]
*  so you could pay better attention. All right. We have things to do. Into the pan. Didn't I tell you [[01:28:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5318.92s)]
*  food is my love language? It's probably my love language. I'm not looking at a recipe. I've got [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5325.4800000000005s)]
*  this in my head. That's another thing that makes me special. We scattered some greens on there. [[01:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5329.4s)]
*  This is fresh from my garden. Pay no attention to that sticker. I don't know how that got on me. [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5336.12s)]
*  Uh-oh. Oh, my dog just got in our pool. And there's the pool man trying to get him out. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5340.52s)]
*  And he's all wet now. Okay, stand by. Be right back. Stradwick! Oh, Stradwick! Sorry. Oh, you [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5344.92s)]

*  it might be time for an outfit change. I think we should both change this time. Part of our love [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5367.16s)]
*  language. Yes, that's exactly right. I could use a break anyway, so this is perfect timing. [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5371.4s)]
*  Oh, fabulous. I just threw it on. You? Of course. Naturally. I mean, this is really what I'm [[01:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5387.08s)]
*  comfortable in most of the time. I prefer to come home after a long day and just slip into [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5391.96s)]
*  something a little bit more elevated, if you will. We're going to make a special fruit medley. [[01:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5396.6s)]
*  It took my producer like three hours to pull the fruit together from the grocery store, [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5407.160000000001s)]
*  so that's done. Moms, you can just whisk right over to your garden and then the Whole Foods and [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5413.0s)]
*  then the Trader Joe's. And ideally the farmers market and you too can come up with totally [[01:30:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5417.4800000000005s)]
*  organic, natural, regenerative products like I have here. Let's get washing. Let's go. [[01:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5421.48s)]

*  just like everyone else. No, they point down, point down. That's how I do it, which means it's the best, [[01:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5434.44s)]
*  the best way. All right, so this is just what I do. I just whip this up in the morning. You could do [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5441.48s)]
*  this with one small row for your kids for breakfast. Ideally in your white cashmere. It's just fruit. [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5445.639999999999s)]
*  It's just presented in a different way. An early rise might really help like three or four. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5450.84s)]
*  It's a real delight in being able to be a present parent. With the nanny. Right, right, of course, [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5457.88s)]
*  of course. You've got to be able to just like go with the flow when you're a working mom. [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5462.84s)]
*  You'll have to work. We all have a lot of stuff to do. If you literally have seven hours to devote [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5467.08s)]
*  to your breakfast charcuterie, you're going to wow them. This is gorgeous. It's so sweet. [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5473.0s)]
*  Nailed it. Nailed it. I can't wait to watch the children eat this whole thing. Do you have children? [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5478.6s)]
*  Where's my drink? Could you please pass me my drink? I'm not sure why it's so far away. [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5487.4800000000005s)]
*  My god, it's exhausting being her. [[01:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5491.88s)]

*  Yeah. Not bad. Not bad. Not bad. Well, this has been so lovely. [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5513.24s)]
*  So happy to have you here, my dear, dear close, long life, long friend. I am so happy I could [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5528.5199999999995s)]

*  It's Fredwick. [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5546.4400000000005s)]
*  I was wondering, wondering, wondering if you were going to use the black tie. [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5556.68s)]
*  Yes, we had to. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5562.280000000001s)]
*  My recollection of that was somehow Strudwick jumping in the pool and you going out in the [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5563.96s)]
*  black tie look. Did I just remember that? I guess I thought that was what happened too, [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5569.8s)]
*  but now looking at the tape, no, I was still in my first outfit. For the listening audience, [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5574.52s)]
*  in the end there, we changed into full black tie gowns and furs. [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5578.04s)]
*  So our stupid series has her changing outfits every two minutes like one does when one has a [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5583.400000000001s)]

*  Yes. That you're not constantly switching in and out of trying to sort of one up each other with [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5593.8s)]
*  your look. Your look that Megan did not understand that word allegedly. But yeah, no, that's what you [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5599.08s)]
*  do. And I think that it was a day, Megan. It was a day. The whole thread of that one was [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5605.72s)]
*  she keeps having all these so-called friends coming on her show. And it's very clear as you [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5612.52s)]
*  watch the show, she knows nothing about her friends. And that's why you're my lifelong [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5617.32s)]
*  friend. But I was like, where'd you grow up? Do you have any children? What is your [[01:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5622.44s)]
*  backstory? What is your wiki thumbnail? I know nothing about you. And then, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5627.32s)]
*  and by the way, I only want to talk about myself. I'll only watch and talk about you. As we discussed [[01:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5631.5599999999995s)]
*  last time, you would ask a question and I would sort of try to jump in while retaining my dignity. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5635.0s)]
*  And you would just cut me off and move on to some other thing that you were beautifully executing. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5639.88s)]
*  And by the way, like, can we talk about like trying the one pot pasta? What do you mean? [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5645.8s)]
*  When we actually eat it? Yeah, I thought it was good. I thought it wasn't bad either. I was [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5650.76s)]
*  impressed. We did it. What? For the record, we followed the Martha Stewart recipe, not not [[01:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5655.0s)]
*  the Meghan Markle. She did steal. Like, if you look at hers, it's just it appears to be just [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5661.0s)]
*  pure theft of the Martha Stewart recipe, which was decent. And so I haven't made it again, [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5666.76s)]
*  but it's there. But that charcuter thing is such a nightmare. That thing took forever. That was [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5672.2s)]
*  the longest thing we did. No one could ever do that at home for a kid in a morning. No, nor would [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5676.2s)]
*  they want to. I mean, and then finally, Strudwick getting the cocktail. We how many we drank like [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5680.84s)]
*  five glasses. He got our cocktails. He got our peanut butter roll thing in the first episode or [[01:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5686.5199999999995s)]
*  second episode. Right. And then he got our what's the other thing he ate? He ate. I can't remember [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5692.36s)]
*  there was a third thing he ate, but he was a menace as he normally is. But he's a sweet boy, [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5699.08s)]
*  but a bad boy. So I do want to show you one other clip of her. She's out still doing her founder [[01:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5703.5599999999995s)]
*  podcast. Yeah, yeah. And she wanted us all to know as she worked in in that clip, we ran there [[01:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5709.0s)]
*  to remind us she's a regular person, Maureen. She's a working mom. So she gets what it's like [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5715.64s)]
*  to be a working mom. Here's the clip. I will say for myself, like, especially when they're baby [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5721.0s)]
*  babies. And yes, the crime before I was a mom, and I've always wanted to be a mom, before I was [[01:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5726.92s)]
*  a mom, I said, Oh, gosh, I'm gonna give a speech with a baby on my hip. Yeah, I had a whole vision. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5731.4s)]
*  I was like, it's I'm just gonna and then you fast forward. Granted, I had a lot of external things [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5736.68s)]
*  happening. By the time I had both pregnancies and both babies. But it was not the way I envisioned [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5741.32s)]
*  it. For me, it's so important that my kids see me as a working mom. Oh, my God, and that we all see [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5748.52s)]
*  her as that because what she's feet she feels guilty about the $150 million she grifted off of [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5755.8s)]
*  being a fake royal. Me me me me me. So important. As I've predicted, once these kids hit 18, they [[01:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5764.360000000001s)]
*  are moving to the East Coast, if not out of the country could be back to the UK entirely, or could [[01:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5772.6s)]
*  be back to the UK entirely. Exactly. You know, and it was the whole thing to she was saying on one of [[01:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5777.72s)]
*  the other shows, you know, I write them emails every night. Yeah, so that so 365 I can't do the [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5781.88s)]
*  math 365 days times 18. Yeah. How many emails is that like they're gonna have the time to go through [[01:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5787.4800000000005s)]
*  that? No, who the hell wants to review thousands of emails from their mom when they were two, [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5792.12s)]
*  when they're later 22. And then of course, there's I leave the room from them that we don't ever talk [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5800.6s)]
*  about the help. Right, right. I leave the room just to take a moment for myself into the other [[01:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5806.28s)]
*  room. And then I miss them so much that rather than go back into the other room, I scroll on my [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5811.24s)]
*  phone. Right. But she pictured herself giving her speeches with a child on the head. She's just so [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5815.639999999999s)]
*  cool. She's going to do it all. But now that she's a working mom, Maureen, she's realizing, it's just [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5821.719999999999s)]
*  so hard, you know, that the life work balance, notwithstanding your huge mansion and your full [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5826.44s)]
*  staff, and the fact that you're married to a prince is just it's very she understands the plight [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5831.16s)]
*  of working women across America. Clearly she does. And also, I'm curious as to how she was going to [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5835.719999999999s)]
*  give said speeches with a baby on her hip when Prince Harry has said the reason they left was [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5840.12s)]
*  largely to keep their children completely out of the public eye. Right, right. Which she wants us to [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5844.36s)]
*  remind us of that she's a princess and she was part of the royal family. That's why she couldn't [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5848.44s)]
*  give the speeches because there was a lot going on in my personal life at the time my babies were [[01:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5852.12s)]
*  born. There was so much going on, like when you're slinging, allegedly baseless accusations of racism [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5855.8s)]
*  against two of the most famous monarchs on the planet, you know, there's a lot going on. [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5860.92s)]
*  Couldn't have a baby on the hip because I had to sling those from the hip. Ba dum bum. Okay. Now, [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5864.44s)]
*  I'm going to have to get to the auto pen story on Monday because we don't have time for it, [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5869.48s)]
*  but it's interesting. There is an investigation underway and there is reportedly a Democrat [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5872.12s)]
*  whistleblower saying who was signing it and when. So more on that. But quickly, Bill Belichick, [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5876.44s)]
*  video has hit of him leaving the home of what we now believe was his then girlfriend, [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5883.5599999999995s)]
*  Jordan Hudson. And this journalist Pablo Torre tracked it down. He was shirtless. It was before [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5891.08s)]
*  we really knew that they were having an affair and she was so much younger than he was. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5897.88s)]
*  Here's the video. Oh my God. Oh, Pablo Torre got his hands on that and probably didn't know [[01:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5902.2s)]
*  whether he should show us or not. And now there is an interview, right? Of the woman who owned [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5909.08s)]
*  that house. Did she speak with Pablo Torre? I think this is it in SOT 20. [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5918.68s)]
*  I come off the golf course and we were just chatting about different things. And that's when [[01:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5924.04s)]
*  she said that she wanted to know how far Danvers was. And I was like, Oh, are you getting married? [[01:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5932.2s)]
*  She can now compete in pageants. And I still wear members at the golf course. You should come play [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5936.2s)]
*  with us. You know, my friends have clubs. They can lend you. She said she played. Yeah, she said [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5940.92s)]
*  she played. She also said she prefers the men's senior shaft. So I just didn't really think much [[01:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5946.04s)]
*  about that until later. OMG. That's so good. There's a question about whether like reportedly [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5952.12s)]
*  this is video that helped keep him out of getting another NFL coaching job. He wound up settling for [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5962.28s)]
*  the college level and oh my God, look at this. And now there's speculation that did she leak it? [[01:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5966.92s)]
*  Is there something? Does she have something to do with it in order to like, I don't know. Did she [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5972.599999999999s)]
*  want him not to get another job at the NFL or just to be more dependent on her? I have no idea. But [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5976.5199999999995s)]
*  there's now reports that they're engaged. And you tell me how this is going to end Maureen. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5981.64s)]
*  Oh, if I were one of Bill Belichick's kids, I would just me just my opinion, I would be concerned [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5987.48s)]
*  for his physical safety. Yeah, I really would. I mean, we know he runs around like a slob is part [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5994.2s)]
*  of his flex. But there's this is also inelegant. It is so unbecoming of a man who had that legacy. [[01:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=5998.84s)]
*  And it's the shaft. Oh my god, shafts kiss. Can you imagine? All I would say is akin to the theme [[01:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6005.72s)]
*  and I Jack Wright available on Brit box. Don't change your will, Bill Belichick. Don't, don't [[01:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6013.64s)]
*  change your will to make her the beneficiary. And if you do, don't tell her about it. 100%. Although [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6019.72s)]
*  I do think she's running the show and apparent to a new report that just came up. Apparently Jordan [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6026.76s)]
*  is being excised from polite society on Antucket this summer. Oh, maybe this may take it another [[01:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6032.04s)]
*  turn. We'll find out our own link. Lauren is very pro the Belichick Jordan relationship and you can [[01:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6038.76s)]
*  tune into his show to find out why. But make sure for now you tune into subscribe and follow Maureen [[01:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6044.84s)]
*  at the nerve with Maureen Callahan. It's honestly it's perfect for a Saturday morning when you got [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6051.08s)]
*  your cup of coffee. That's what I'll be doing. And you can do it with me. Maureen. Love you. [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6056.28s)]
*  You too, Megan. Thanks for being here. Thank you all so much for watching and my thanks to one, [[01:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6060.679999999999s)]
*  the one and only Maureen Callahan. She's such a keeper. What a star. Don't forget to go and [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6064.839999999999s)]
*  subscribe to her show the nerve with Maureen Callahan on YouTube and on podcasts. And listen, [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6068.919999999999s)]
*  have a wonderful, wonderful Memorial Day and take a minute, especially on Monday, to think about [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6074.599999999999s)]
*  our troops who pay the ultimate price and their families to to keep this country safe and free. [[01:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6079.96s)]
*  It's not just a day off, right? There are people who are really going to be thinking about [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6086.5199999999995s)]
*  lost loved ones on Monday and let's make ourselves among them thinking about those [[01:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6090.12s)]
*  who gave it all in the name of freedom and liberty and all the great ideals that this [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6095.64s)]
*  country has fought and stood for for almost 250 years now. Now we will have a special [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6099.8s)]
*  Memorial Day episode for you. These episodes that we've been doing the past few years on Memorial [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6104.76s)]
*  Day where we feature a veteran who has caught our eye. They're extremely popular. And it's for a [[01:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6108.599999999999s)]
*  good reason because we actually think long and hard about who we're going to book on those days [[01:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6116.36s)]
*  and you will not be disappointed on Monday. Do you know who John McPhee is? John McPhee is [[01:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6119.96s)]
*  former Special Forces. He was on Sean Ryan. He was on Joe Rogan. But I'm telling you, [[01:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6126.04s)]
*  you've never heard him like this. We went places I had never heard him go. He did not hold back. [[01:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6131.4s)]
*  He's one of the most interesting people I've ever sat across from. He was right here in the Red [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6138.84s)]
*  Studio. In every moment between us, I was on the edge of my seat. The guy is unlike anybody I've [[01:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6143.8s)]
*  ever talked to. I think you're going to love it. It airs on Monday and I would love your feedback. [[01:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6149.88s)]
*  In the meantime, you can email me as always, megan at megankelly.com. Have a wonderful weekend with [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBE4MGBgOwc&t=6154.2s)]
