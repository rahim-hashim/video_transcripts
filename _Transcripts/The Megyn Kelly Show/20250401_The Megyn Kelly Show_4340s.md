Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Dr. Daniel Amen, author of "Raising Mentally Strong Kids," to talk about how parents are hurting their kids by helping them and doing so much for them, how it's actually a way for the parent to benefit rather than the kids, the keys to raising resilient kids, mistakes parents often make by coddling their children, the key factors of time and listening, how parents can stay involved responsibly in helping their kids when they're older, the dangers of social media, how to avoid raising dependent adult children, the need to notice kids and give positive affirmation rather than only paying attention to the negative, new ways of using brain scans to treat patients, and more. Then Rachel Mason, director of "Last Take: Rust and the Story of Halyna," joins to talk about what her friend cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was really like, the tragic "Rust" movie set shooting that took Halyna's life, why Halyna's family wanted to make sure the movie "Rust" was completed, how "Rust" is finally set to be released soon, why the film was "sad and painful" but also "magnificent" and well-made, how a live round could have gotten in the gun that Alec Baldwin shot that killed Halyna, all the mistakes that had to happen on the set to get to this point, the confusion on the set that day, how the shooting was like "fiction meeting reality," the guilt so many feel to this day, and more.

*  Thank you for saying that likewise, so I always love your posts [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=101.86s)]
*  They always make sense to me that I always get it like an additional pearl of wisdom that I didn't have before [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=106.62s)]
*  But the one that made me say could we please book him? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=111.12s)]
*  Please get him on the show was one in which you were talking about. This is the condensed version [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=114.32s)]
*  today parents do way too much for their children and they steal their [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=120.52s)]
*  Self-esteem you are making the point that you may think [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=126.48s)]
*  You're doing all the household chores or whatever it is in our neighborhood [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=130.88s)]
*  All the parents drop their kids off at the bus stop like what right back in my day [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=136.06s)]
*  We had to walk to the bus stop and wait for them like they sit in these beautiful SUVs and whatever [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=140.2s)]
*  You may think you're helping or being kind to your child and you are making the point [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=145.64s)]
*  That's a you thing you're doing that to make yourself feel good and you are stealing something [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=152.2s)]
*  Important from your kid in the process. Let's kick it off there [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=159.2s)]
*  Well [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=163.92s)]
*  Because [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=166.23999999999998s)]
*  Parents are working so hard [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=168.28s)]
*  They often have this tremendous guilt about not spending enough time with their children [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=170.60000000000002s)]
*  And so they do do do do [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=177.56s)]
*  Thinking it's somehow benefiting them [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=181.32000000000002s)]
*  But really it's building the parents self-esteem by stealing your child's [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=183.72s)]
*  There's this great study out of Harvard where they followed kids [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=190.16000000000003s)]
*  Literally over 70 years looking at what goes with health success and [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=194.48s)]
*  Longevity and the only thing that went with self-esteem [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=200.52s)]
*  Was whether or not you worked as a child whether or not you had a paper route or you had chores at home [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=204.32s)]
*  Or you actually like me. I had a job my dad owned grocery stores and from the time I was 10 [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=210.96s)]
*  I went to work [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=217.3s)]
*  and what working does is it [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=219.16s)]
*  It boosts your sense of competence and [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=222.76s)]
*  Competence is directly related to self-esteem. So if you're solving all of your children's problems [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=227.84s)]
*  They don't feel competent and thus don't feel very good about themselves [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=236.12s)]
*  No, I see this with parents all the time where they solve their child's problems [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=241.32s)]
*  Not necessarily speaking about homework, but just the kid comes up with well this kid did this to me [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=247.08s)]
*  and rather than [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=252.20000000000002s)]
*  Teaching the child how to think it through [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=253.92000000000002s)]
*  They say this is what you should do and I think a lot of parents enjoy the dependency [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=257.16s)]
*  That results from that [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=264.0s)]
*  No question that they get in their mind more connection [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=268.0s)]
*  and [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=275.4s)]
*  You know, I mean it's so rewarding take the wisdom you gained over decades [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=276.76s)]
*  and pour it [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=282.56s)]
*  Down your child's brain. The problem is it just doesn't work. What we're teaching them is to not be competent and [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=283.8s)]
*  When a child says I'm bored [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=293.6s)]
*  Rather than go well, you could do this or you could do that or how about we do this together? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=297.0s)]
*  Just repeat it back. It's like you're bored. I [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=303.1s)]
*  wonder what you're gonna do about it and [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=307.76s)]
*  Then be quiet [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=309.92s)]
*  long enough [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=312.52s)]
*  For them to generate their own [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=314.52s)]
*  solutions parents talk way too [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=318.0s)]
*  Much and in raising mentally strong kids. I talk about [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=321.88s)]
*  The first thing is know what you want. What kind of parent do you want to be? [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=326.92s)]
*  What kind of child do you want to raise? I want to raise [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=331.28s)]
*  mentally strong [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=336.28s)]
*  Kids well that means I have to teach them to solve problems [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=337.68s)]
*  I can't do it for them. And then the second thing it's bonding and [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=341.84000000000003s)]
*  bonding requires two things time actual physical time [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=347.88s)]
*  Parents are so busy and so distracted by their own devices [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  that they're not spending time with children and [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=360.16s)]
*  really important a [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=364.48s)]
*  Willingness to listen so when your child says something on board [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=366.64000000000004s)]
*  Rather than solve it for them go just repeat back what you hear [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=372.48s)]
*  it's what therapists do all the time at least but hate and [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=378.48s)]
*  Wait for them to fill in the blank because they're filling it in using their brain [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=383.52000000000004s)]
*  To generate options and what if they say what can I do? [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=392.68s)]
*  What can I do? Mom? What can I do? [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=396.48s)]
*  Like I wonder what can you do and what can you do and [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=401.04s)]
*  Then be quiet [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=406.64000000000004s)]
*  So that their brain works [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=408.88s)]
*  To fill in now after five minutes if they're like, what can I do? What can I do? Do you want to hear? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=412.20000000000005s)]
*  Maybe what other kids? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=418.8s)]
*  might do and [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=421.04s)]
*  Then generate options, but you know as soon as you generate options, they're gonna argue with [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=422.56s)]
*  How to build everybody wants to build mentally tough kids resilient kids now growing up in the 70s [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=430.24s)]
*  The way that my mom did it was she just [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=436.56s)]
*  insulted me a lot [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=440.08s)]
*  Kind of joking but it's there's a little truth to it. I don't know [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=443.08s)]
*  She just she didn't coddle us is my point never coddled us and she never told us we were good at something that [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=447.36s)]
*  We weren't good at ever so I always had a very keen sense of what was an actual skill [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=452.52s)]
*  Versus a fake skill, you know what I mean? I never over judged my capacity for something now [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm a lot nicer than my mom was so then I worry am I am I gonna raise soft kids? [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=464.15999999999997s)]
*  So I need to insult them more. How what is the what is the way forward? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=469.68s)]
*  Well, I think the way forward is bonding and connection and [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=475.28s)]
*  Modeling you really want to raise brain healthy kids is you have to live the message [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=480.08000000000004s)]
*  You have to model it and the more you model a healthy brain a healthy mind healthy [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=486.20000000000005s)]
*  relationships if you are children like [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=494.0s)]
*  And this is very important if they don't like you they pick the opposite [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=497.64000000000004s)]
*  values so [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=504.68s)]
*  Growing up I did not have a good relationship [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=506.44s)]
*  With my dad he worked all the time [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=509.08s)]
*  the only time I saw him is when I went to work with him and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=511.32s)]
*  He tended to notice what was wrong about me more than what was right about me [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=515.36s)]
*  1972 I turn 18. It's the first time I can vote [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=521.4399999999999s)]
*  He says if I vote for McGovern the country will go to hell [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=524.64s)]
*  I vote for McGovern and the country went to hell but it had nothing to do with McGovern. It was all Nixon and [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=528.24s)]
*  But it was it was the lack of bonding and [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=535.84s)]
*  Connection that drove me to do the opposite of [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=541.6400000000001s)]
*  Him if he would have spent time with me listened to me now, I'm one of seven so [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=546.84s)]
*  was chaos in my family, but [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=553.96s)]
*  It would have been much different now later on in life. He's my best friend and [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=557.5600000000001s)]
*  We vote in a similar way, but [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=562.9s)]
*  It's so important that connection and that bonding is not doing everything they want you to do [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=566.1s)]
*  Bonding is time. It's listening and helping them learn to be competent [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=573.58s)]
*  Can we talk about the advice giving as we mentioned this a second ago, you know about helping them solve their own problems [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=580.1s)]
*  And maybe helping them walk the path with the right questions [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=586.74s)]
*  They should be asking but can you speak to the difference between if there is any that process when you're dealing with let's say my kids [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=589.86s)]
*  Are 11 13 and 15 and then my friend who I talked to a lot about her adult children [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=596.6600000000001s)]
*  Who are more like 31 and 29, you know, she [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=602.62s)]
*  Desperately wants to weigh in on like who they're dating or their latest job choice [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=607.46s)]
*  And I'm over here like I wouldn't I wouldn't not at that age [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=612.6600000000001s)]
*  But at my age is I think you do have to be more vocal about your opinions. I don't know. Am I wrong? [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=617.3s)]
*  Well, you know, I think always default to [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=627.5799999999999s)]
*  Firmankind and yes at 11 13 15 [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=631.4599999999999s)]
*  They need guidance. I always say God gave you parents until your frontal lobes [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=636.3s)]
*  Develop so the front third of your brains called the prefrontal cortex [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=643.0600000000001s)]
*  It is actually not fully developed until you're 25 [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=647.5s)]
*  And that's why we need to do a much better job of protecting young [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=652.1800000000001s)]
*  developing brains [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=658.3000000000001s)]
*  Like not giving them access to social media until they're 14 15 16 [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=660.5400000000001s)]
*  Just because it's so toxic there for them [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=667.26s)]
*  So being involved and [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=670.7s)]
*  Supervising them and kids hate it when you supervise them and they hate it more when you don't [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=674.46s)]
*  Because in their mind, it's like you're you don't care [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=681.22s)]
*  So, I mean until my kids were [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=686.54s)]
*  1718 I want to know where you are who you're with what you're doing and oh by the way, I'm gonna check and [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=690.18s)]
*  Now we have ways to check that were much better than when my kids were young and so but when they're old [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=697.8199999999999s)]
*  Your job is to be sort of a good friend and a good coach [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=706.18s)]
*  And never forget. I'm always a long-term planner never forget. They're the ones that are gonna be taking care of you [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=711.9s)]
*  when you're 90 and so [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=720.7399999999999s)]
*  Always sort of kind to my children, but if I do too much I create [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=724.7s)]
*  Dependents and that's absolutely not what you want when they're 25. Well, and also I worried that you create resentment [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=732.0600000000001s)]
*  I worry [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=740.0600000000001s)]
*  you know in in [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=741.86s)]
*  Expressing your real opinion about let's say, you know the daughter's boyfriend if the daughter's [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=744.5s)]
*  27 I [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=750.1s)]
*  Don't know I feel like at that age they're gonna do what they're gonna do and I would be very hesitant [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=751.86s)]
*  I would feel like my role was more to be like [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=756.86s)]
*  You know, you'll figure it out [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=760.14s)]
*  How do you feel when you're around is ask questions as opposed to say how I feel because I'd be worried that if I'm like [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=762.28s)]
*  He's a he's a shit [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=769.74s)]
*  This is definitely not the one for you [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=772.38s)]
*  you have a greater likelihood of you either throwing her into his arms just because [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=774.22s)]
*  You know, it's okay for you to think your guys bad, but if anybody else thinks it then you're defensive of him [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=778.3000000000001s)]
*  Or her just I don't know clamming clamming up and not sharing future things with you [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=783.5s)]
*  Yeah, no, I think it's that line but if you really think he's a shit you need to tell them because [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=790.5s)]
*  You need to tell her [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=798.46s)]
*  because new love is a drug new love is [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=800.38s)]
*  Just like you've been [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=806.32s)]
*  Taking cocaine and you're not thinking [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=809.2s)]
*  Rationally and often it takes six months a year [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=814.0400000000001s)]
*  18 months for you to see oh this person's really not great for me and [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=817.88s)]
*  It goes back to [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=826.8000000000001s)]
*  the [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=828.8000000000001s)]
*  Relationship if they know you want to spend time with them that you're listening to them that you're rooting for them like a [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=829.84s)]
*  Good coach. I always think you know, who's the best teacher you've ever had [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=838.4s)]
*  Who's the best coach you've ever had they notice what you do, right? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=844.12s)]
*  and they teach you when you could do better and [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=849.32s)]
*  Too often parents that are ineffective [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=853.48s)]
*  Notice what you do wrong and [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=857.44s)]
*  never let you forget it and [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=860.5600000000001s)]
*  so maybe a little bit like your mom clearly like my dad and [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=862.96s)]
*  That that's not [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=869.8000000000001s)]
*  Effective because if he goes, oh you shouldn't do this my mind [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=871.44s)]
*  Just to oppose him is like [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=876.64s)]
*  Well, I think I should do that. That's exactly what I'm gonna do [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=879.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, somebody once told me that we've had many many dog trainers because we have a very naughty boy in our dog family and [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=883.52s)]
*  Somebody said it's the same way that you would raise a good kid [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=891.64s)]
*  Expected behavior is not commented on [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=897.6s)]
*  Great behavior good extra behavior is praised [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=902.0400000000001s)]
*  fully and and vocally and [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=906.2s)]
*  Negative behaviors are ignored [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=909.36s)]
*  Unless they can't be you know, unless like he's in the process of biting somebody and like intervention is required [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=912.1999999999999s)]
*  But I kind of like that right? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=916.88s)]
*  It's like you don't thank your kid for unloading the dishwasher because that's an expected chore [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=918.72s)]
*  That's part of being a member of this family same way [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=925.0799999999999s)]
*  They don't expect you know, I don't expect them to thank me for making my bed [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=928.1999999999999s)]
*  You know like that kind of thing [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=932.56s)]
*  but like an an extra kindness or an extra moment of politeness or of them like looking out for each other and [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=933.56s)]
*  Stuff you want to see a lot lot more of yeah, I vocally praise that profusely [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=941.64s)]
*  Well, there's a part in the book raising mentally strong kids that I just loved so much and [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=948.72s)]
*  I [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=955.68s)]
*  collect penguins [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=956.84s)]
*  In my office at work. I have [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=958.4399999999999s)]
*  dozens of them and the reason I collect penguins is so I have six kids and [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=961.8s)]
*  Three of them are adopted and I adopted my oldest and he was hard for me [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=967.92s)]
*  Argumentative [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=974.88s)]
*  Oppositional and I really didn't like being a dad [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=976.2s)]
*  I'm like this is just no fun at all and I was a child psychiatry [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=980.08s)]
*  Fellow so I was doing my child's character training and I'm talking to my supervisor about it [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=984.28s)]
*  And she says you have to spend more time with him, which was sort of the last thing I wanted to do [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=989.02s)]
*  And true though I was living in Hawaii at the time [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=994.28s)]
*  That's right [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=998.24s)]
*  Did my child psychiatry fellowship and I took my son to a place called Sea Life Park? [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=998.76s)]
*  Which is on a lot who and like Sea World they have sea animal shows and we went to the killer whale show and that [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1005.24s)]
*  Was great and the dolphin show but at the end of the day [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1011.5999999999999s)]
*  He grabs my shirt. He goes. I want to see fat Freddy and I'm like who's fat Freddy. It's like the penguin dad [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1015.04s)]
*  Don't you know anything? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1021.68s)]
*  And so we went to the fat Freddy show and it's this little chubby [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1023.92s)]
*  Humboldt penguin who is amazing. He comes out onto the stage [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1030.08s)]
*  He climbs like a 12 foot [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1035.76s)]
*  Ladder to a diving board goes the edge of the board [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1038.76s)]
*  Bounces and then jumps in the water and I'm like whoa, and then he gets out of the pool [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1042.9199999999998s)]
*  Bulls with his nose counts with his flipper jumps through a hoop of fire and [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1049.64s)]
*  At the end of the show the trainer asked him to go get something and Freddy went and got it and [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1055.16s)]
*  he brought it right back and at that moment time stood still for me and [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1061.2800000000002s)]
*  I'm like I asked this child to get something for me and he wants to have a discussion [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1067.5600000000002s)]
*  For like 20 minutes and then he doesn't want to do it and I knew my son was smarter [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1072.44s)]
*  Than the penguin so I go up to the trainer [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1078.04s)]
*  Afterwards, I'm like, how'd you get Freddy to do all these really cool things and she looked at my son and then looked at me [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1081.48s)]
*  And said unlike parents whenever Freddy does anything like what I want him to do. I notice him [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1087.3200000000002s)]
*  I give him a hug and I give him a fish and even though my son didn't like raw fish [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1094.0800000000002s)]
*  I realized I was like my dad [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1101.0600000000002s)]
*  But he did things I liked I paid no attention to him at all and when he didn't do things I liked [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1104.8999999999999s)]
*  I gave him a ton of attention. So I was inadvertently teaching him [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1111.74s)]
*  To do bad things to get my attention. So I'm dense [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1116.82s)]
*  I collect penguins is a way to just remind myself [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1120.8999999999999s)]
*  Every day notice what you like more than what you don't like and we have a new study [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1126.34s)]
*  So it I have 11 clinics around the country. We do brain imaging if you came to see me [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1131.94s)]
*  we'd want to look at your brain before we gave you medicine or [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1137.22s)]
*  Anything like that and I have a brand new huge study coming out on [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1142.3s)]
*  negativity bias [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1149.02s)]
*  negativity versus positivity [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1151.1000000000001s)]
*  it's really the fat Freddy story and [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1153.46s)]
*  If you are more negative you have less function in the front part of your brain as opposed to if you're more [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1156.5s)]
*  positive and [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1166.14s)]
*  so I'm a huge fan of [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1167.66s)]
*  Accurate thinking with a positive spin so not positive thinking because that can get you into all sorts of trouble but [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1172.1s)]
*  Accurate thinking with a positive spin. Hmm. That's it that I feel like that's [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1180.14s)]
*  My bread and butter for the most part. In fact, believe it or not this year for lent I gave up negativity [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1185.98s)]
*  Which is it sounds like a cop-out but it was designed around what you're talking about now [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1193.54s)]
*  I kind of give myself the two hours off of this show because I got to do the news in the way [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1200.02s)]
*  I do the news. I can't be can't mess with it. But in my in the other 22 hours of the day [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1204.4s)]
*  I'm trying to give up negativity and I'm not a negative person [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1210.18s)]
*  I think I am an accurate person with a positive spin and [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1213.66s)]
*  But I have noticed now that I've made a point of it how many times I'll say, you know, like I [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1217.02s)]
*  Can't stand that or that sucks or we wait we played the game Padel over vacation, which is not paddle and it's not pickle [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1223.02s)]
*  It's Padel. It's big in Europe. It's like a racket sport and [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1230.94s)]
*  Everyone my family's great at racket sports, but I am NOT and instead it's little things but instead of being like, oh my god [[00:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1234.3400000000001s)]
*  I suck. I was saying things like I'm not I'm not quite good yet [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1240.72s)]
*  Yeah, I'll be better the next time just these little things and then I read that you're big on starting the day by saying [[00:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1245.48s)]
*  This is going to be a great day and I've been doing it [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1253.28s)]
*  It's just these little little pick-me-ups doc. They actually have been making a nice difference in my life [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1257.04s)]
*  Well, if you start the day with today is going to be a great day and my favorite one is end the day [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1263.24s)]
*  With what went well today? It's a great exercise to do with the kids [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1269.54s)]
*  but when I go to bed at night, I say a prayer and then I go what went well today and [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1275.06s)]
*  Go through my whole day [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1281.8600000000001s)]
*  Looking for what was right rather than what was wrong and the bad stuff shows up, but I'm like no [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1284.22s)]
*  this is not your time and [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1291.02s)]
*  people who do that within [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1294.22s)]
*  Three weeks notice a significant difference in their level of happiness [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1297.5s)]
*  and imagine if you just do it with the kids and [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1304.3799999999999s)]
*  Whenever you have a meal together. It's like hey, what are you looking forward today? Hey, what went well today? [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1308.7399999999998s)]

*  Positivity bias in their minds and my wife the tennis she and I do a podcast together [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1319.6599999999999s)]
*  And we just did a big podcast on negativity versus positivity [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1326.62s)]
*  bias and [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1331.4199999999998s)]
*  Her mom died just about a year ago and [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1333.4599999999998s)]
*  But she and I noticed she was more negative and that's what grief does [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1336.6999999999998s)]
*  But if she worked on it, what she said is I find the [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1342.26s)]
*  micro-miracles in my day [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1347.6599999999999s)]
*  Even the little things like I make her a cup of brain healthy hot chocolate every night and she's like just the first [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1350.3000000000002s)]
*  Taste is a micro miracle [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1358.14s)]
*  It's a practice [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1361.66s)]
*  that you can do and [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1363.98s)]
*  You know the most effective way to raise mentally strong kids is you be mentally strong [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1366.98s)]
*  yourself and [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1374.26s)]
*  That's why I'm so grateful you follow me on social media because that's the whole goal is [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1376.3s)]
*  I was just at the White House and I hate the term mental illness. It shames people [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1382.42s)]
*  It's stigmatizing and it's wrong. These are brain health issues [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1388.82s)]
*  That steal people's minds the brain physical function of your brain [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1395.34s)]
*  creates your mind and so as [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1400.5s)]

*  coordination exercises [[00:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1415.8200000000002s)]
*  Because people who play racket sports live longer than everybody else [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1417.5s)]
*  People who play football and soccer live less long than everybody else [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1424.8600000000001s)]
*  I did the big NFL study when the NFL was sort of wine. It had a problem with traumatic brain injury in football [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1431.34s)]
*  I scanned and treated 400 NFL players and [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1438.54s)]
*  What we should be doing with kids is playing racket sports [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1443.18s)]
*  and I think one of the best things my mom did with me, she's great at ping-pong and [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1448.46s)]
*  I played table tennis growing up and [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1453.94s)]
*  I [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1457.38s)]
*  Love table tennis tennis [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1458.6200000000001s)]
*  Those are the things to do with kids rather than put them in soccer or football [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1460.78s)]
*  where on [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1466.6200000000001s)]
*  Average every year they get a concussion [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1468.46s)]
*  Right, right. Oh, it's a table tennis is hilarious. It's great. My kids love it. They're very good with all rackets [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1471.5800000000002s)]
*  They have the Doug Brunt my husband's hand. I I don't yet have it [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1478.54s)]
*  Maybe this will be my year, but I have dreams of secretly going to the ping-pong place [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1483.7s)]
*  there's a table tennis place not far from where I live and like saying I'm working out or something else and then [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1488.42s)]
*  In the summer when we really play a lot of it [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1494.38s)]
*  Busting out my ninja skills on my kids and BAM showing them like they're like those Olympic with the it's great to watch even my 11 [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1496.82s)]
*  Year old has to go easy on me now because he's so good at it [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1502.66s)]
*  But that's interesting with the table tennis before we leave that this topic [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1504.9s)]
*  What is a brain healthy hot chocolate what tell us all everyone wants to make it now [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1509.5s)]
*  It's so good [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1515.74s)]
*  But before I do that get a coach go to the USA TT org [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1518.26s)]
*  United States and American Table Tennis Association [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1523.66s)]
*  Or get a coach. It's okay. The more you work it [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1526.38s)]
*  The better you will become it's a cerebellar function [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1531.46s)]
*  Which is a very critical part of the brain and if you didn't develop that when you're young you can totally [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1535.62s)]
*  Develop it now. So brain healthy hot chocolate [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1542.22s)]
*  rock cow [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1546.38s)]
*  Organic rock cow unsweetened almond milk heat up the almond milk put a heaping [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1548.66s)]
*  Teaspoon of raw cacao. There's a company. I like no financial connection to them called sweet leaf [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1556.18s)]
*  They make [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1563.48s)]
*  11 different flavors of [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1565.2s)]
*  stevia and [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1568.2s)]
*  their chocolate is unbelievable and [[00:26:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1569.6799999999998s)]
*  Put in a couple dropper fulls put in a blender [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1573.72s)]
*  It's so good and oh literally and it's calorie smart, right? [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1578.08s)]
*  It's about 30 to 60 calories. It tastes great. It loves you [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1583.48s)]
*  You love it and it loves you back. So it's just those two things almond milk and [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1589.92s)]
*  What was the third thing so rock a cow unsweetened? [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1596.92s)]
*  Organic almond milk and chocolate stevia from sweet leaf. Oh, I see. Okay. All right [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1602.64s)]
*  And and how much of the chocolate stevia goes in there just like a packet or what? [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1609.28s)]
*  It's a liquid it goes to whatever your taste is [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1613.8400000000001s)]
*  Some people like it a little bit better. Some people like it super sweet. So my [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1619.04s)]
*  Was a handy maker and so I like sweet things. Oh [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1624.8000000000002s)]
*  All right. That's good. I can do this. All right now wait [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  Let's go back to the brain scans and what you were saying about mental illness. So fascinating [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1631.72s)]
*  so if if [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1637.96s)]
*  somebody comes into you and says [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1639.76s)]
*  I'm depressed or I have anxiety or [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1642.28s)]
*  Whatever it is is the first thing you would do as a psychiatrist a brain scan [[00:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1645.8799999999999s)]
*  You wouldn't just be like talk therapy or the big thing now is take this drug [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1650.76s)]
*  Well, how would you know unless you look so I'm a nobody looks [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1655.92s)]
*  actress and [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1660.92s)]
*  I belong to the only medical specialty that virtually never looks at the organ it treats and [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1662.6399999999999s)]
*  So for the last 34 years we've been doing a study called brain [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1670.04s)]
*  Imaging looks at blood flow and activity looks at how your brain works and Megan [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1675.68s)]
*  Literally, it has changed everything in my life how I diagnose my patients how I treat myself [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1682.04s)]
*  If you date my daughter for more than four months, I'm gonna scan you because I really [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1689.8799999999999s)]
*  want to know [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1696.56s)]
*  We have a poster. I don't know if you heard the president and the Department of Justice [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1698.56s)]
*  But he's about a conversation he had with the Mexican president and it's like why doesn't [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1703.16s)]
*  Mexico have the drug problem we have even though you're selling us the drugs and [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1709.5200000000002s)]
*  They have a very vigorous drug education [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1714.92s)]
*  Campaign. Well, as soon as I started scanning people in 1991 [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1719.4s)]
*  I'd take a healthy scan and then one of my [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1723.5s)]
*  marijuana users cocaine users [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1726.96s)]
*  Alcoholics their brains look so bad and we put it on a poster and called which brain do you want? [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1729.52s)]
*  Which now hangs in about a hundred thousand schools prisons churches [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1735.56s)]
*  around the world [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1740.3600000000001s)]
*  it's like [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1742.08s)]
*  The real reason not to use drugs is they damage your brain [[00:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1743.92s)]
*  alcohol is not a health food and [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1750.08s)]
*  Marijuana is not innocuous [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1753.48s)]
*  We have to stop lying to the American public and go [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1755.96s)]
*  These are not good things [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1762.44s)]
*  But the first thing you have to do is get them to fall in love with their brain [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1764.64s)]
*  And that's what the imaging did for me [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1769.56s)]
*  It's your brain is involved in how you think how you feel how you act how you get along with other people and [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1771.92s)]
*  When your brain works, right you work, right and when it doesn't [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1779.0s)]
*  You'll never live up to your potential so now you go drugs damage the brain and [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1783.2800000000002s)]
*  Why would you ever damage your potential unless you were self-defeating? [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1790.68s)]
*  Mm-hmm. So what well, what could you see in a brain scan that would change the way you would help? [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1796.0800000000002s)]
*  Somebody coming in with any one of those things or other things people see a psychiatrist for [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1802.24s)]
*  well [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1807.8000000000002s)]
*  But one of the big lessons I learned from imaging is mild traumatic brain injury is a major cause of psychiatric [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1808.92s)]
*  illness and nobody knows about because psychiatrists never look so your [[00:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1816.48s)]
*  suicidal ideation [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1822.44s)]
*  Your depression your panic attacks your ADD or learning disabilities [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1823.76s)]
*  Could have been from the car accident your family was in when you were four or I have one patient depressed [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1828.8400000000001s)]
*  This whole life fell off the hood of a minivan when he was 18 months old [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1835.76s)]
*  Unconscious for a day. They thought it was a minor injury years later [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=1843.48s)]

*  Thing that can happen every now and then when a person [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2512.12s)]
*  Connects with you on every single level because our kids would hang out and then she's just such a talented dp that we work together [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2515.72s)]
*  I would direct things and she would shoot and as you know, there's also not that many female [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2522.8399999999997s)]
*  Dps directors of photography. So [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2527.3799999999997s)]
*  When she died her widower matt actually asked me to make a film about her life and death and that's how this all happened [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2530.6s)]
*  Oh my gosh, I mean when you heard about this horrible day [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2539.7999999999997s)]
*  Because I mean as a civilian not involved with anything and you know on the set [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2544.6s)]
*  I I remember I remember where I was when I heard this I was like what you're so bad [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2549.24s)]
*  So can you just tell us how did that affect you as somebody who is her dear friend? [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2553.96s)]
*  I imagine at first you're thinking wait. It can't be my can't be my friend. Like what movie what cinematographer? [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2557.96s)]
*  Right. Oh, yeah. No, it's actually [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2564.7599999999998s)]
*  I mean, it's still even now this surreal unthinkable quality of it is there because [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2567.0s)]
*  It's not just the layers of shocking [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2573.32s)]
*  Twisted, you know the last time anything like this ever happened was brandon lee, you know in terms of a set with a gun [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2576.82s)]
*  a person was um, you know injured and killed with um [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2584.5200000000004s)]
*  So that just made no sense [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2588.5200000000004s)]
*  And then there's a celebrity factor and this giant global news story as well [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2589.7200000000003s)]
*  And and then the reality of jalena who's a person with so much life [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2594.2799999999997s)]
*  Left, I mean there just was no world in which this could even be true [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2598.68s)]
*  To me, so yeah, it took a very long time to process the reality of it [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2603.08s)]
*  So I remember hearing that they were going to complete the movie not not your documentary, but the movie rust thinking no [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2607.72s)]
*  No, not there's no way like [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2615.0s)]
*  And I thought for sure that her widow or matt would not want that but I had it exactly backwards [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2618.12s)]
*  As you explore in the documentary he he did want it completed and so did jalena's mom [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2624.52s)]
*  Can you talk about why? [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2630.12s)]
*  Well, I think this is one of those things as well that um, you know [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2632.92s)]
*  From from a distance and from news coverage if you were following the story and only getting certain bits of information [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2636.84s)]
*  You know, this is what I love about documentaries is that you really get the opportunity to speak to people on every [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2644.36s)]
*  side and have nuance and [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2651.08s)]
*  Change the story based on what is really going on. And so when we met with jalena's mom she had [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2652.92s)]
*  Spoken to jalena just before she died and jalena herself told her how excited she was about this film [[00:44:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2661.24s)]
*  And how much she wanted to finish the film and her mother said, you know every film jalena has touched matters to [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2666.92s)]
*  Especially this last one like we want to finish it. This really is important [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2673.56s)]
*  And if you knew jalena that made perfect sense. I mean jalena is so obsessed with her work [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2678.2s)]
*  I mean, I I cannot think of a single time [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2684.2799999999997s)]
*  I ever spoke to her that she wasn't talking about her last film and all the things she learned from it and so [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2686.92s)]
*  Knowing that her mother wanted this completed knowing her family wanted this completed [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2692.7599999999998s)]
*  I even personally had conversations with her son because he would be curious about all of the films [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2697.24s)]
*  She was working on so she was so intrinsically connected to her work [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2702.68s)]
*  You know when you understand that the family wants something any victim of any awful horrific tragedy as soon as you know [[00:45:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2707.56s)]
*  What the family wants, you know, if the family wants a tree in someone's honor [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2714.68s)]
*  You just want to do that. And so her family wanting this film done [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2718.04s)]
*  It really was almost like a heroic effort of everybody to go back to this [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2722.7599999999998s)]
*  absolutely unfathomable trauma it's like walking back into a war zone and [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2727.7799999999997s)]
*  Every single person who I met on the set completing the film was there [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2731.9599999999996s)]
*  Because they were just trying to do what they could to honor jalena [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2737.16s)]
*  And once I understood that I was like, wow you people are being vilified and yet you're doing something heroic [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2740.68s)]
*  So it really made me question my own industry, you know [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2747.0s)]
*  The the the people on the set of rust were really treated very badly. Um [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2750.4399999999996s)]
*  People were thinking of them as sort of like wow, this is so shameless [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2756.04s)]
*  You know, you're just finishing this film [[00:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2760.04s)]
*  And it was so wrong [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2762.68s)]
*  They they actually had every reason to be worried for finishing the film because they could be blacklisted for association with rust [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2763.64s)]
*  And so they were willing to do it because they cared about jalena [[00:46:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2769.96s)]
*  Do you do you know how they decided to handle the scene in in the in the final cut of the movie? [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2774.2s)]
*  What i'm aware of is that that was actually [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2782.12s)]
*  Reconstructed altogether the whole entire um scene where where [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2785.06s)]
*  You know homina was killed. It was actually there was a rehearsal and they really made an effort to change the film and not [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2789.72s)]
*  go into that piece of it and um [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2797.88s)]
*  You know, I have seen the film and honestly, it's an extraordinary film [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2801.08s)]
*  I I will say i'm biased towards the cinematography, which is so unfathomably beautiful and a testament to homina's great talent [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2805.7999999999997s)]
*  Um [[00:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2814.52s)]
*  But I felt you know, it was a really sad painful film to watch but it was really [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2815.7200000000003s)]
*  actually magnificent as well because um the the crafting of the film was absolutely amazing and the director jill susa is [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2820.84s)]
*  Really talented [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2829.2400000000002s)]
*  And it it was so I can't even imagine how hard [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2830.92s)]
*  Um that film it's hard to direct any film. It's really really hard to direct a film [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2834.76s)]
*  Um, and especially with all that emotion and everything going on it right where he too was shot [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2839.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean he was shot with the same bullet right? We believe it was the same bullet that hit both jill and halina [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2846.28s)]
*  fired from alec baldwin's gun which was supposed to be [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2851.4s)]
*  Not uh was not supposed to have live rounds in it but did and one of the big mysteries of this case in [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2855.56s)]
*  The criminal proceedings that have gone down is how did that live round get in there? [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2861.4s)]
*  How did it get in there in what was supposed to be? [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2865.32s)]
*  A dummy round as I understand it [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2868.68s)]
*  This is one of those guns where you can see the bullets and so when you bring out this said gun a prop gun on a set [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2871.16s)]
*  You need fake bullets that look like [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2877.56s)]
*  Real bullets there. That's why they call them dummy rounds. They're not exactly blanks. There's something else [[00:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2880.92s)]
*  and um [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2886.04s)]
*  the armorer [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2887.56s)]
*  Somehow had a weapon supply in there that had live rounds mixed in with dummy rounds and that is how [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2889.24s)]
*  Alec wound up [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2896.84s)]
*  Shooting halena and jill with this one bullet the real debate [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2898.52s)]
*  Legally became did he pull the trigger? He said no then the fbi and many experts said that's not possible [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2903.32s)]
*  He had to have pulled the trigger [[00:48:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2908.92s)]
*  even some of his defenders said [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2911.08s)]
*  He shouldn't pull the trigger but [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2913.1600000000003s)]
*  Nobody if they pull the trigger is thinking that there's a live round in there and then people on the other side said no [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2915.4s)]
*  This is why you never pulled the trigger [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2921.0s)]
*  Um, so this is these are just some of the debates that were unfolding in the industry over this time [[00:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2923.16s)]
*  The the armorer hannah gutierrez reed is the daughter of a very famous [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2927.88s)]
*  respected armorer in hollywood, but she did not have that level of respect and you delve into [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2933.78s)]
*  Kind of how she got this job and some of the safety questions that came up around her performance early on [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2940.84s)]
*  Yeah, um, well I will say firstly just going back no [[00:49:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2948.76s)]
*  No [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2953.08s)]
*  Bullets should ever be on any movie set. That is so so unthinkable [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2953.96s)]
*  Um, so the very first thing that anyone in the industry [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2958.44s)]
*  Especially in the armoring profession mostly which is handled by people with extensive [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2962.44s)]
*  Training often military backgrounds or law enforcement [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2968.52s)]
*  that was the very first shockwave was just to [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2972.68s)]
*  like [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2976.28s)]
*  Just be so sickened really. I mean truly we interview [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2977.24s)]
*  Andy were who came in to finish the film and he is a really seasoned armorer with military background and [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2981.0s)]
*  and those were the words he used like [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2987.4s)]
*  The the armoring profession is actually really quite [[00:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2989.96s)]
*  Amazing the track record very safe. I know that sounds like a strange thing to say because this is guns but [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=2994.2000000000003s)]
*  most armorers [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3002.04s)]
*  are [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3004.28s)]
*  I mean, I would almost say all armorers that i've ever heard of have a [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3005.08s)]
*  Really high level of skill [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3008.68s)]
*  so [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3011.48s)]
*  You know again, it's points to things that are a problem in our industry in the film industry that need to be addressed [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3012.52s)]
*  And looked at how we hire people this kind of idea that you might just be qualified because [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3019.24s)]
*  This is your father and and in fact that is actually quite a typical [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3024.8399999999997s)]
*  Scenario in the movie industry including on the set of rust. There was a very lovely father and son team [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3029.06s)]
*  And you know, I kind of like that dynamic because you could see is a special effects of her [[00:50:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3036.44s)]
*  He's teaching his son the tricks. So that's not unusual that often people in this industry [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3040.92s)]
*  Have you know a family connection? [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3045.96s)]
*  But in this case, you know [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3048.36s)]
*  Relying on that entirely, you know, that's that was one of those things that you have to question [[00:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3050.92s)]
*  there's so many aspects of [[00:50:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3056.2000000000003s)]
*  The the narrative around all of the different issues that could have happened [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3058.6000000000004s)]
*  It's all coming back to me. I [[00:51:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3063.8s)]
*  Almost forgot his name [[00:51:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3066.1200000000003s)]
*  Seth Kinney is the name of the guy who supplied the ammo to the armorer and there was a bit of a you know [[00:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3067.88s)]
*  Finger-pointing thing between the two of them where Hannah Gutierrez read was like he gave me a box of mixed live rounds and dummy rounds [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3074.98s)]
*  She still would have had responsibility [[00:51:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3083.48s)]
*  for [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3086.04s)]
*  Making sure whatever went into the guns she had on set was only dummy rounds [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3086.92s)]
*  But I and he denied that he had done that but I remember that was one of the points of contention she did wind up [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3092.12s)]
*  Well, she she pled guilty right? Did she was she found guilty or did she plead guilty? Why can't I remember? [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3098.36s)]
*  She well a jury found her guilty and sentenced her to 18 months and she is serving time in a correctional facility in [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3103.32s)]
*  New mexico now, but wow, you have a great memory. Yes, Seth, Kenny the weapons supplier [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3111.1600000000003s)]
*  I mean, you know when you sit in a courtroom the cast of characters starts to unfold and I found it all very fascinating and I [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3115.0s)]
*  Didn't ever think about where bullets come from or or the fact that sometimes actors do [[00:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3121.88s)]
*  You know target practice and they might need to do it [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3127.6400000000003s)]
*  So they understand the feel of a real gun, but that doesn't happen on a set at all [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3129.8s)]
*  Shouldn't and it can't even you kind of conceive of it happening when you're set but could those bullets be mixed in? [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3134.36s)]
*  I mean, wow, these are things that you it's only when something horrible happens to even [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3141.08s)]
*  contemplate [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3147.54s)]
*  Those elements and again when we were watching our film we have body camera footage and you also see that when the cops came to the set [[00:52:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3148.84s)]
*  It was a crime scene [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3155.88s)]
*  Immediately, but it was a set as well [[00:52:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3157.96s)]
*  So you have the cop looking at alec and saying is that is that real blood and alec is like well [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3160.1200000000003s)]
*  No, of course not. It's fake blood [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3165.1600000000003s)]
*  But you know, it's a it's that world of fiction meeting reality that is also like well, it could be real blood, sir [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3166.44s)]
*  You know and this is alec being like there's no way it could be real blood and they're in in both people's minds [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3173.4s)]
*  You are living in two alternate realities in the film world. You're making fiction. There's no bullets. There's no blood [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3178.84s)]
*  It's all fake. It wasn't yeah, but it wasn't and you you you get at this in your documentary again [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3185.2400000000002s)]
*  It is called last take rust and the story of helena. It's on hulu right now. You get at this in part with um [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3190.76s)]
*  The special effects team and one guy in particular who's talking about something called a squib [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3199.56s)]
*  Which I didn't know anything about a squib but a squib is like something you you kind of like it's it's fake blood that you [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3206.6s)]
*  As a special effects guy make sure gets on [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3212.6800000000003s)]
*  The person in the movie who needs to look like they've been shot and just here's uh, here's a bit from that [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3215.48s)]
*  Let's listen to stop 45 [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3222.12s)]
*  But and I would [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3223.88s)]
*  Fire that little charge. It's called a squib that would send the blood flying and my first thought I looked down in my hand [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3225.48s)]
*  The button and I thought to myself [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3232.84s)]
*  Why the hell did we squib her? [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3235.88s)]
*  That was just my first thought [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3238.6800000000003s)]
*  I saw this and I looked down and there was no [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3240.76s)]
*  No button and that's when I said, oh my god. She's been shot [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3243.88s)]
*  The disbelief [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3250.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3252.36s)]
*  Wow megan, this is cool because I gotta say my little director brain went and it's like oh [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3253.08s)]
*  I fought so hard to make sure we get that in this movie and you know, you have thousands and thousands of hours of you know [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3257.2400000000002s)]
*  Ideas and footage and I remember specifically saying, you know the edit team you guys this matters so much because when I heard tom gandy [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3262.52s)]
*  That's his name describe a squid pack, which is the thing that explodes [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3270.2000000000003s)]
*  You strap it on a person and it explodes and depends on you know [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3273.7200000000003s)]
*  Every movie you've ever seen a person blood popping off of you know, it is a really kind of well-designed thing [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3277.4s)]
*  It goes under a person's shirt and then it pops and he has to pull that trigger and when he was explaining it [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3283.2400000000002s)]
*  I mean also I will say as helena's friend you're just like [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3289.0s)]
*  No, please god. Actually, this is so insane. There cannot be a world in which [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3292.92s)]
*  He's watching her actual body explode for real and he knows what it's supposed to look like when it's fake [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3299.0s)]
*  And he knows he didn't put that on her so he knows it's real and so I was sitting there and I remember being like [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3306.68s)]
*  Oh my god [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3313.4s)]
*  Whoa, it was a real moment again to the point like thank you for finding that clip because it was like fiction meeting reality [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3315.56s)]
*  And these moments were you know in the world of entertainment, which we all love movies [[00:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3322.52s)]
*  It's this question of like wow [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3328.2000000000003s)]
*  Are we putting people into a scenario where there's ever the possibility of something this real happening? And if so, it's just [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3329.64s)]
*  Terrifying to imagine you just think about the horror of those in that room helena chief of all but [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3336.6600000000003s)]
*  Those around her. I mean everybody alec baldwin all of them were horrified. I think everyone accepts that [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3343.8s)]
*  and the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3350.84s)]
*  Assistant director david halls. We talked a little bit about the armorer, but he also takes responsibility and had to because it was [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3351.96s)]
*  he was the person who handed the gun to alec and [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3360.36s)]
*  the rules are that [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3363.96s)]
*  He should have checked it too. There's supposed to be all these redundancies built in built in [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3365.96s)]
*  So that this can never happen you did speak to him you spoke to everybody except alec [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3370.44s)]
*  Um, but here is a bit from the assistant director david halls in south 44 and I brought me the gun [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3375.64s)]
*  She opened up the hatch [[00:56:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3381.64s)]
*  And I saw three bullets and you only saw the three only saw the three [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3384.44s)]
*  Okay [[00:56:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3390.7599999999998s)]
*  Do you normally check all of them or? [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3391.96s)]
*  What what do you usually do should? [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3395.88s)]
*  Okay, I was negligent the inspection of that gun [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3398.76s)]
*  It could have been a more thorough inspection I pled guilty [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3405.48s)]
*  But guilty a thorough inspection didn't happen I could have been a last line of defense [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3412.92s)]
*  This poor guy yeah, i'm just watching that and you know what i'm thinking rachel is like [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3421.96s)]
*  It's when people say it wasn't my fault it wasn't it was someone else's responsibility that we all pile on [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3427.08s)]
*  That we that we are the ones saying no [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3434.12s)]
*  It was you when you hear a guy like that [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3437.16s)]
*  You have the opposite instinct. You know you you want to relieve him [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3440.8399999999997s)]
*  That's a great point. I mean that is absolutely fascinating to think about that because [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3445.48s)]
*  it's I [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3450.7599999999998s)]
*  when I met dave the first time I was actually in the courtroom and [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3452.44s)]
*  I had been wearing halina's hat which actually is this hat right here [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3456.3599999999997s)]
*  I wore this hat on every interview and this was the hat she wore on the set of rust [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3460.44s)]
*  and um, so he recognized it right away and he came up to me and [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3465.4s)]
*  and just started crying and just like [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3469.72s)]
*  The the the pain that I experienced immediately, you know seeing a grown man cry like just that level of of pain [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3472.6s)]
*  um, it's truly astonishing and I remember feeling like [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3479.7999999999997s)]
*  You know initially I was like pissed at all these people i'm like, what the hell are you guys like but then I said I was like [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3483.56s)]
*  Oh wait [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3489.56s)]
*  This was an unfathomable [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3491.16s)]
*  Nightmarish accident and this guy has to actually live with the image in his head of what we're seeing in the film is you know [[00:58:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3493.46s)]
*  There was a moment in which he could have stopped it [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3501.3999999999996s)]
*  but I mean the [[00:58:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3503.64s)]
*  It's like the armorer if we presume as she says that she did shake the bullets because it should have been a different shaking [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3504.9199999999996s)]
*  Sound from a dummy round versus a live round is what they said [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3511.08s)]
*  If she really did do it, who knows if she really did do it [[00:58:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3514.68s)]
*  But if she really did do it and she wasn't able to determine the dummy from the live [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3517.4s)]
*  Could david really have done it? I mean not a not an ammo expert [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3521.88s)]
*  You know, it's we have redundancies, but I you know, we're probably thinking on most of these sets [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3525.7999999999997s)]
*  They're mostly unnecessary [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3530.7599999999998s)]
*  We're really kind of just making sure it's not there's not like an obvious problem and this this wouldn't have been [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3532.7599999999998s)]
*  um the [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3538.2s)]
*  The stuff with the crew really jumped out at me. I know she was crew obviously she was part of the crew [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3540.2s)]
*  But as somebody who's been not an actress but on camera for many years [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3544.8399999999997s)]
*  You get very close to your crew and the crew guys are like truth detectors [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3549.48s)]
*  Like they just if you're a bitch if you're a nightmare to work with [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3554.68s)]
*  They know they just know and these guys clearly loved her and loved working with her [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3559.3199999999997s)]
*  And there's a we pulled this clip of a guy named jonas huerta from the camera crew [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3565.72s)]
*  Who also seems to be taking responsibility, you know, it's like he they all all these good guys are like it was on me [[00:59:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3570.92s)]
*  It was on me. It was on me. We pulled a little bit of that in in stop 43 [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3577.4s)]
*  and the moment [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3581.96s)]
*  Helena arrived [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3584.2s)]
*  It like all of our hearts dropped because she looked like blindsided. She did not understand what was going on [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3585.96s)]
*  She's like what's going on or like we're [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3592.36s)]
*  We're leaving like this we're done like [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3594.92s)]
*  She's like, I don't understand like it feels like i'm losing my best friends [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3598.2000000000003s)]
*  Her monitor wasn't working and she had to [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3603.08s)]
*  See the frame from the steadicam and I was like well if I was there [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3608.44s)]
*  I could have put her monitor out of harm's way. I could have [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3613.1600000000003s)]
*  You know, I always made sure that she was out of the danger like anytime [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3616.76s)]
*  The gun was pointed I would make sure that monitor was safe [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3621.32s)]
*  Oh [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3628.5200000000004s)]
*  He walked off along with many others that day because the set was riddled with safety concerns [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3629.48s)]
*  well, you know one of the things that I pointed out is that [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3637.0800000000004s)]
*  everybody basically feels some level of survivor's guilt and and and in discussing a second ago the idea of the different [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3640.84s)]
*  Stop gaps that exist so that you know, you don't have a gun without being checked one or two times [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3648.92s)]
*  You also never should be standing in front of the gun. And so his trauma comes from the fact that [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3654.12s)]
*  One of the protocols that exists is actually that you have a monitor and Helena should have never been where she was [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3660.7599999999998s)]
*  But because they had walked off [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3667.0s)]
*  He didn't have a chance to set that monitor up [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3668.84s)]
*  And so he goes back in his mind and just lives with this awful feeling which of course he shouldn't be feeling like [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3671.32s)]
*  Actual real guilt that's would have you know, someone else might have gotten shot in a horrible other way if there was real bullets [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3678.04s)]
*  But you know looking at these different reasons for everyone [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3685.16s)]
*  Um, you know feeling these feelings you can see there's sort of a cascade of things that led to [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3689.32s)]
*  This happening and I will say, you know interviewing the guys that walked off. They had quite a few different [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3695.72s)]
*  Things they were making noise about on the set and it's great [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3702.28s)]
*  Like you see the reality of just i'm saying crew [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3705.4s)]
*  Yes, i'm glad that you know what it feels like to work with crew in it [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3707.96s)]
*  And in a way, it's like the behind the scenes the the backbone of every single thing [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3711.48s)]
*  We're doing even now there's producers. There's people we rely on deeply and yet no one ever sees them [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3716.2000000000003s)]
*  So I was happy to be able to reveal that world [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3721.1600000000003s)]
*  Because people only ever see the actors and see the main people on screen. You mostly don't even know who your favorite dp is [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3724.36s)]
*  And what they look like [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3730.76s)]
*  You know, but yeah, that's a really talented [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3732.52s)]
*  That was her world that's those were her, you know frontline workers and [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3735.48s)]
*  I'm sure they were affected probably more than than even the cast by her death [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3740.2s)]
*  On the subject of alec [[01:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3745.56s)]
*  He was charged and then ultimately the charges were dismissed with prejudice, which means that we're done [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3747.56s)]
*  He's not going to get charged again [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3754.2s)]
*  He has a reality show with his wife and she spoke to [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3757.96s)]
*  The effect this whole thing, I mean the shooting obviously he was holding the gun [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3762.3599999999997s)]
*  to [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3767.72s)]
*  The almost criminal prosecution to just the public aftermath and all of it [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3768.6s)]
*  And uh, here's what she said on their tlc show recently [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3774.04s)]
*  Everyone who was close to alec has seen [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3779.16s)]
*  His mental health decline [[01:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3782.2s)]
*  He was diagnosed [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3784.68s)]
*  with ptsd [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3786.44s)]
*  and he says you know if [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3788.2799999999997s)]
*  In his darkest moments if an accident had to have happened this day [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3790.92s)]
*  Why am I still here why couldn't have been me? [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3796.44s)]
*  What do you make of that rachel and why do you think he did not speak with you for this documentary [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3801.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, um [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3808.84s)]
*  Gosh, you know, I just that's the first I I I haven't been paying attention truthfully to um [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3810.6800000000003s)]
*  His reality show but I was aware of it and so hearing that um [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3817.0s)]
*  You know, I will say there's just this agony of ptsd that exists and it's very real and there's every single person [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3821.4s)]
*  Does have that and and I did actually speak to alec. Um myself [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3830.1200000000003s)]
*  um, I happened to know alec from my first documentary which is called circus of books and [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3835.2400000000002s)]
*  I got to know him at a film festival the hamptons festival [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3841.7200000000003s)]
*  And so after this happened, I I spoke to him and I I heard that trauma in his voice that first [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3844.6000000000004s)]
*  Call and it actually was [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3852.04s)]
*  Horrifying, you know just to hear the trauma that just like dave halls you you start to understand like wow [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3854.5s)]
*  People have seen something that they will never get this image out of their head. It's burned in it is [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3861.32s)]
*  It's a it's a terror. It's a those that probably gives them all nightmares [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3865.96s)]
*  Um, you know, I had to deal with the loss of just my friend which is not anything small. It's huge [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3870.04s)]
*  It's vast i'll never get over it, but they had to deal with like seeing [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3875.24s)]
*  something that only exists in horror movies like or you know, just like cops and [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3879.48s)]
*  People and I mean he has to deal with the horror of actually having caused it, you know [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3884.92s)]
*  Using that term gun. Yeah, just as a matter of fact. I mean he definitely caused it [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3889.96s)]
*  Um, so the film it doesn't have a villain [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3895.72s)]
*  Do you think [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3899.96s)]
*  you know having made it now like [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3901.88s)]
*  Who is to blame like what on what do you blame the death of your friend? [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3904.12s)]
*  God, you know blame is a really complicated word [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3910.36s)]
*  And i'm not sure I fully grasped it because there's so many people at different moments that I felt really mad at and then I would [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3913.32s)]
*  Open a door and be like, oh, okay. Wait [[01:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3920.36s)]
*  I'm mad at you, but you're living in a personal hell that i'll never [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3923.08s)]
*  You know like dave halls when I met him and I was like wow [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3927.08s)]
*  There's actually no prison sentence that could be worse than your own head going through this for the rest of your life [[01:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3929.72s)]
*  Same with hannah like my god, um, she has to live with this horrific [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3936.2799999999997s)]
*  set of like feelings and the guilt of that so [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3941.08s)]
*  Um when I think about what i'm the most upset at I think on some level [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3944.6s)]
*  that's where this idea of [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3950.36s)]
*  Examining almost like the workplace environment [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3953.1400000000003s)]
*  that allowed [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3957.08s)]
*  What I started to understand and feel could be almost any workplace like [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3958.52s)]
*  You know you you think about an accident now anytime there's an accident on a set [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3964.28s)]
*  I'm immediately keyed in like there was a guy who fell to his death on a [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3967.7200000000003s)]
*  Radford studios, which is a really like very high level place here in la marvel [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3971.88s)]
*  Print and this guy died on this i'm like, oh my god, like how would a person die on that set? [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3977.24s)]
*  It's the opposite of rust like that. That's a marvel film, but then I want to go through that chain reaction [[01:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3982.2s)]
*  There's this there's that and that person might have been on a smoke break or taking and this person wasn't here if that happened [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3987.96s)]
*  And why was were people aware that there might have been a faulty? [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3993.24s)]
*  Rig setup. Oh, yeah people knew about this thing you read about it. You understand like, okay, so [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=3997.0s)]
*  Just like on an airplane where it won't lift off the ground until you have all the cross checks [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4002.44s)]
*  I really feel like the same thing has to happen for a movie set like you cannot say go until these cross checks exist [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4007.88s)]
*  There can't be a way in which there could be a gun at all [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4013.88s)]
*  That could be just in a position where it hasn't been checked where an actor happens to have it in its rehearsal and people aren't [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4017.32s)]
*  That was part of the other problem. There were so many different [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4024.12s)]
*  Levels to this scenario [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4027.32s)]
*  This was an unplanned [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4029.32s)]
*  Scene it was a rehearsal and that happens all the time in films, you know [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4031.56s)]
*  I'm sure you might have an idea and i'll say like hey [[01:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4035.48s)]
*  Let's just get this cool shot the guy's running that way, you know, especially if you're in journalism like and you might want to do something [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4037.6400000000003s)]
*  Well, there's this sort of spur of the moment act that can happen and when you're dealing with [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4043.4s)]
*  You know, it's not just guns but like explosives stunts [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4048.84s)]
*  I spoke to the guy who actually worked on the harry potter film. He was daniel radcliffe stunt double and he's permanently paralyzed [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4053.0s)]
*  There's actually a good documentary about him called the boy who lived and I wanted to understand what? [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4060.04s)]
*  Oh my god, like you got hurled against a wall [[01:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4065.32s)]
*  Going like 80 miles an hour like you could have died this you're permanently paralyzed this horrific nightmare accident [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4069.24s)]
*  So we're in this pressure cooker environment people are going fast and they don't know each other very well [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4075.88s)]
*  and I think those are some of the things that [[01:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4080.52s)]
*  when I think of what I got the most angry with it's like [[01:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4082.68s)]
*  Where are the additional checks? How can we make this better? In fact? [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4086.2799999999997s)]
*  That's a line was it a money problem? I mean, that's what we read in the news is that it was underfunded basically [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4089.56s)]
*  They were they were trying to do it to skinny [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4094.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, that's one of those things what I have to question as well [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4097.96s)]
*  Was it just a money problem because again i'm looking at other film sets where? [[01:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4101.4800000000005s)]
*  You know, they had plenty of money and someone died or got killed or had a or sorry [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4106.04s)]
*  had an accident and [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4111.24s)]
*  it's more about the decision making and the communication gaps as far as I can tell because [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4113.56s)]
*  Sure, you can save money here. But and so yeah, yeah the decision to [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4118.92s)]
*  Again get a low ball armorer as tom gandy says in our film. That's one of those decisions, but it's it's one of many [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4124.04s)]
*  Decisions that when you look at this scenario, it wasn't just that [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4131.78s)]
*  And I think that's part of the issue [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4136.679999999999s)]
*  Do you? [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4139.08s)]
*  Maybe this is a weird question, but [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4141.32s)]
*  Whenever there's tragic loss, especially if someone at a young age and a mother a wife [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4144.28s)]
*  I I think it's natural to ask why? [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4150.28s)]
*  What you know, what good could possibly come of this? Why would god allow this? [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4153.32s)]
*  Is there some greater meaning that's that's been gleaned from it? [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4157.5599999999995s)]
*  Will it will the death save lives like is there any is there any answer? [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4160.44s)]
*  on that [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4166.2s)]
*  That's the the big question again, you know and I I've went through that every single minute of [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4168.04s)]
*  every day for the last three and a half years because [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4173.32s)]
*  Not that I would want anyone to die [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4176.599999999999s)]
*  But like I I think about this as like my god of all people helena had everything going for her and rust would have been [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4178.44s)]
*  The film that was going to launch her whole career. She was up for enormous jobs and also [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4185.32s)]
*  You know I speaking to another woman in an industry that is heavily dominated by men [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4191.5599999999995s)]
*  Especially just like the powerhouse ones you're like I want you to you're going to succeed like I knew it [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4195.96s)]
*  There was no doubt helena was going to get an oscar. She was going to be up there with the top [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4200.52s)]
*  She was and so to me her [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4206.4400000000005s)]
*  particular death was like [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4209.540000000001s)]
*  So cruel so unfair [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4212.360000000001s)]
*  Um to all the people that knew and know her and think about her as just a rising star [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4215.160000000001s)]
*  um, yeah, I wonder that and I think and that's part of why I think the things that continue [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4221.56s)]
*  To allow her to be spoken of like this great opportunity right here. Thank you. Um to speak about her [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4227.32s)]
*  Um to speak about what happened. Those are all things that yes, and I think of like, okay [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4233.96s)]
*  Can we make meaning from this? Is that possible? [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4238.2s)]
*  um to do it's [[01:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4241.4800000000005s)]
*  You know that that is something I [[01:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4244.2s)]
*  Know I would wish I could trade this all for her in two days like two seconds. Nope [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4246.28s)]
*  I would much rather have her [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6spolOGsoYo&t=4250.4400000000005s)]
