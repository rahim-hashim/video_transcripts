# Vatican Selects American Pope, Joe Biden's "TORTUROUS" Sit Down with The View, and More w/ Ruthless
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. There is so much to get to today. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=0.0s)]
*  It is an incredibly busy news day. President Trump announces the first trade deal with our [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  longtime ally, the UK. The president says it's the first of many, plus a wild and awesome hearing on [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=8.88s)]
*  Capitol Hill yesterday. Brandon Gill is my hero. Remember this guy who went after the head of NPR [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=17.76s)]
*  with her blonde hair and her weird affect. This obvious rich white Connecticut woman riddled with [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=28.4s)]
*  white guilt for her enormous privilege growing up in Connecticut. And she had sent out all those [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=36.4s)]
*  wacky tweets about wanting to pay reparations and reading the case for reparations. And then he got [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=42.0s)]
*  to her. She's like, I never read that book. Really? Then why did you tweet? You tweeted that you did. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=47.92s)]
*  I don't remember ever doing that. You tweeted it. I took the whole day off to read a book [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=52.72s)]
*  on reparations. This book anyway, he's back. And he took to task the villain who heads up [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=56.56s)]
*  USA Fencing. I mean, I got like, what? Why are we spending time on USA Fencing? Because it's headed [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=66.08s)]
*  by a villain who is making decisions that are actively hurting young women. And all we needed [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=72.0s)]
*  was to get this cretin in front of people like Brandon Gill, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Nancy [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=77.84s)]
*  Mase, all three of whom disemboweled this man. I'm sorry. It was awesome. Okay, we'll get to that. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=85.03999999999999s)]
*  And we have a new nominee for Trump's Surgeon General. You know this if you listen to AM Update. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=93.19999999999999s)]
*  And it's a great one. Dr. Casey Means. You all know her. She's been one of our favorites on [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=100.24s)]
*  the show these past two years. You know, she's brilliant. She's taking some attacks. We'll get [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=106.0s)]
*  into why and discuss it in just a minute. Here to react to all of this. What a great day to have [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=112.0s)]
*  the news line up with these guys. Josh Holmes, Michael Duncan, John Ashbrook, and comfortably [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=118.16s)]
*  smug the hosts of Ruthless, a podcast and YouTube show. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=124.16s)]
*  on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook, and X. Trust in the media is at an all time low. And [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=132.8s)]
*  let's be honest, it's no mystery why. We have all seen how stories are twisted, buried, or outright [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=139.28s)]
*  ignored, depending on who's in charge or what narrative they want you to believe. But now [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=144.0s)]
*  there's Ground News, an app and website that gathers related articles from around the world [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=148.16s)]
*  in one place, highlighting each source's political bias and corporate influence. Ground News created [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=152.96s)]
*  their blind spot feed to expose important stories receiving lopsided coverage and reveal how media [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=158.32s)]
*  narratives shape the conversation. And now you get 40% off the same unlimited access to their [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=164.16s)]

*  independent and supported by subscribers, not corporate interests. Check them out at groundnews.com [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=174.8s)]
*  slash Megan. That's G-R-O-U-N-D news.com slash Megan to take back control of the news you consume. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=180.24s)]
*  Great to see you guys. Great to see you. Thanks for having us. Oh my gosh. So in that [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=188.48s)]
*  was standing all that like the trade, we're going to get to all of it. But we have to start with [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=193.28s)]
*  what just happened over the past 62 minutes on the view. And it's not even one of my wacky view [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=197.6s)]
*  clips for you where we just make fun of sunny or joy. I mean, we love those, but this is like legit, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=205.04s)]
*  Joe Biden, who's on well, you guys will tell me what he's doing here. And I'll tell you what [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=211.12s)]
*  Mark Halpern says. He's on some sort of a rehabilitation tour. Well, okay. Anyway, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=217.12s)]
*  he goes on to the view and it wasn't rehabilitative at all here. Okay. Let's start with, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=222.56s)]
*  I guess, 37. Is that the one we love the best, Steve? You pick. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=232.4s)]
*  35, 35. Why do you think the vice president lost? And were you surprised? [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=239.44s)]
*  I wasn't surprised, not because I didn't think the vice president was qualified person to be [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=245.44s)]
*  president. She is. She's qualified to be president of the United States of America. But I was [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=250.24s)]
*  surprised. I wasn't surprised because they went the route of the sexist route, the whole route. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=255.28s)]
*  I mean, this is a woman, she's this, she's that. I mean, it really, I've never seen quite as [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=262.08000000000004s)]
*  successful and a consistent campaign undercutting the notion that a woman couldn't lead the country [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=269.59999999999997s)]
*  and a woman of mixed race. Yeah. He could barely spit it out. And he threw that one out there too. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=276.47999999999996s)]
*  My goodness. He and Obama are two peas in a pod on this, sexism and racism, if you didn't vote for [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=285.36s)]
*  her. That's obviously what she thinks too. But the nerve of this guy of all people to come out [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=292.56s)]
*  and say that's why she lost. Yeah, I mean, here's the deal, Megan. You know, they're putting him out [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=297.12s)]
*  there to provide proof of life because a lot of people are wondering, they hadn't seen him in a [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=304.24s)]
*  while. But at some point in every person's life, you go from rehab to palliative care. He is [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=308.4s)]
*  definitely in the palliative care category right now. It's also sort of funny to me, like they're [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=316.16s)]
*  so effusive in their praise of Kamala Harris. Like at some point, it sort of undercuts whether [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=322.48s)]
*  she was actually qualified. You have to say it every time you mention her. It's true. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=327.44s)]
*  The other thing is like, it's obvious the reason why she lost. It was all the damaging video and [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=332.32s)]
*  audio of her from when she ran for president back in 2020. It was being tethered to his [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=337.92s)]
*  terrible administration. So like, of course, it's easy for him to be like, well, it was misogyny and [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=343.76s)]
*  racism. That's why she went down because then he doesn't have to admit the thing that he was a [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=349.04s)]
*  terrible president. Yeah, it was my border. Yeah. What the hell was he talking about, by the way? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  He was like, I've never seen such an effective misogynistic campaign. That's actually a first [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=358.88s)]
*  take. I mean, I know that Democrats say, well, it's because the country is misogynistic and [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=365.20000000000005s)]
*  racist and all those things. But like, he's pointing the finger basically at the Trump [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=370.48s)]
*  campaign saying that they had like this. Well, I mean, if you go back to like the ad slate [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=374.08s)]
*  of the messaging matrix that the Trump administration put together in the course of that campaign, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=379.2s)]
*  it was immigration, it was crime, it was the horrible economy. I mean, none of these things [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=384.8s)]
*  are gender specific. All of these things are his horrible decision making that she was latched to [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=390.0s)]
*  the belt on at the view when she said, I can't think of anything I would do differently. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=395.68s)]
*  They asked him about that. They asked him about that moment. Watch this, South 36. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=401.6s)]
*  When the vice president was here, I asked her if she would have done something differently than [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=407.04s)]
*  your administration over the past four years. And because of all the successes that your [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=412.64000000000004s)]
*  administration had, I think her response was there is not a thing that comes to mind. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=418.32000000000005s)]
*  Now that answer was weaponized against her. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=425.52s)]
*  There has been some reporting that you encouraged her for there to be no daylight between the two [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=429.68s)]
*  of you. First, is that true? And do you think in retrospect that she should have tried to [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=434.32s)]
*  differentiate all the wins that your administration had? Well, look, first of all, I did not advise her [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=439.76s)]
*  to say that. Number one, you said I was vice president. I understand the role. Number one, [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=448.08s)]
*  number two, I think it was I think she was talking about she was wouldn't have changed the successes [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=454.08s)]
*  we've had, not as opposed to that we wouldn't change anything at all. She has to be her own [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=461.84s)]
*  person. And she was she was. And so I think that that that was used in a way that is contrary to [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=467.36s)]
*  what she meant by when she said that. And I think that, you know, she was part of every success we [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=476.96s)]
*  had. We'd argue like hell, by the way. No, no, no, that's good. We sit and say, well, what about [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=486.32s)]
*  this version? Joe, I don't like that. Well, anyway, we worked it out. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  Did that clear it up for you? I mean, that that gerbil is having a hard time [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=500.47999999999996s)]
*  spinning the wheel. It is about his tortures. I've ever seen. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=506.88s)]
*  It was torturous. And on Sunny's part, too, there, like, yes, he is trying to hand this off to Biden. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=513.36s)]
*  And hopefully he can take it from there. Right. Like, like, OK, she wants to straight face, [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=522.4s)]
*  tell us that what the question was, like, what sort of wins would you have changed? Like, like, [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=526.96s)]
*  like that's an actual question you would ask a person. It doesn't make any logical sense. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=531.2s)]
*  You know, it was so insane the way that she's like beyond effusive of being like, so here's the thing [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=535.36s)]
*  because of your record of tremendous successes, dear leader, like what are you asking him a question? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=541.04s)]
*  Joe Biden, tell us your greatest weakness. You know, you know what's so amazing about it, [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=547.84s)]
*  you guys, is that so here she's like, I am not going to make the same mistake twice. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=553.4399999999999s)]
*  You know, I already fucked up Kamala Harris's run for the office and I am not going to do anything [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=557.92s)]
*  to undermine this guy. So I'm just going to give him the answer in the question. Like, you know, [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=562.88s)]
*  and so she declined to distinguish any of her policies from all the ones that you did so [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=567.68s)]
*  successfully. What's your reaction to that? Right. So she's trying to give him the softball like that. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=573.52s)]
*  And then he has no idea what she has said. Like in his defense, it was kind of incomprehensible, [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=579.2s)]
*  but this is not the way to set Joe Biden up for success because he couldn't spin it quite the [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=585.04s)]
*  way she could. And by the way, for the listening audience, she read the entire question. These [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=590.56s)]
*  women are dopes. They can't help with their own thoughtful question. They can't ad lib something. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=594.9599999999999s)]
*  She's just reading what some producer and I know this personally, I've been on the view many times. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=600.4799999999999s)]
*  They give you the questions in advance as the guest. I guarantee you they gave those questions [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=605.1999999999999s)]
*  to Joe Biden too. In any event, what a joke, right? Like, and so none of it made sense. The [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=612.4s)]
*  premise of the question was false. Like she was giving Kamala the chance to differentiate herself [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=618.08s)]
*  from all the successful policies that Joe Biden had. And then his answer, which is, I don't think [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=624.24s)]
*  people used her answer in a way that represented what she really meant, which was, I think what you [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=631.44s)]
*  just said, something about how successful I was. It's exactly right. There was one moment where I [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=638.1600000000001s)]
*  think something registered for Biden. If you caught at the very end of her question and she said, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=646.88s)]
*  I asked this question and the Republicans weaponized it against her. And he's like, [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=653.28s)]
*  I didn't tell her to say that. You could see his face. It's almost like, you know, if you have a [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=658.8s)]
*  generator, your house and the power goes off and like everything's dark for a second, then you hear [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=664.72s)]
*  the generator kick on. That's like what it looked like. His eyes all of a sudden opened and he was [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=668.56s)]
*  like, I didn't do that. It got the epinephrine shot. Yeah, no, you're exactly right. That was [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=673.44s)]
*  an amazing, they weaponized it. You mean they reacted to the things she said and said, gee, [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=679.44s)]
*  that's going to hurt her. She should differentiate herself because he is very unpopular. Weaponizers. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=685.9200000000001s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. I think what's really interesting to me is seeing the way that, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=692.8800000000001s)]
*  so this is an opportunity to talk to Joe Biden, which would be a great get because you could [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=697.2800000000001s)]
*  actually ask serious questions because I mean, the American people want to know. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=701.2s)]
*  And their choice is to be like, so because of all your successes, right? And then that like, [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=706.0s)]
*  their thinking is that, oh, this must have been just sexism and racism at it again. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=711.5200000000001s)]
*  This is why they're stuck where they are as a party. They can't escape the stupid set of ideas [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=716.08s)]
*  that they ran on. And because this wasn't a close election, they got smoked in every swing state. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=722.1600000000001s)]
*  Trump won the popular vote. This is the worst loss the Democrats have had in a generation, [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=727.36s)]
*  if not beyond that. But they're not turning the page on that. Like when you were talking about [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=731.84s)]
*  how, well, they're trying to say it was a campaign of misogyny. The only ad discussing gender, [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=736.96s)]
*  I remember the Trump campaign ran was the effective one that said that Kamala's for they, [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=742.4s)]
*  them Trump is for you. That was Trump standing up for women. Right? Right. It was the opposite. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=747.2s)]
*  It was the opposite. Oh, I gotta interrupt you. We got white smoke. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=752.24s)]
*  Is it pizza? It's a baller. We, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=760.8s)]
*  please. We got white smoke coming out of the Sistine Chapel chimney, signaling a new pope [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=766.08s)]
*  has been elected to lead the Catholic church. Wait a minute here on SiriusXM. We have firsthand [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=772.88s)]
*  access to data because we are in tight with the Catholics. We know Cardinal Dolan. We know a lot [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=779.6s)]
*  of people around him. I'm going to ask my team to go check out our sources and find out whether we [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=786.24s)]
*  have infiltrated the Sistine Chapel and we can give you an advance word. Oh, it's gotta be the [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=792.64s)]
*  Italian guy. People cry for pizza baller. They cry for it. Okay. It's exciting. Like, let's see. [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=799.0400000000001s)]
*  The basic thing I'm looking for as a Catholic is are we going to double down on left-wing [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=808.48s)]
*  progressivism in the pope like we had with Francis or we're going to go more traditional [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=814.1600000000001s)]
*  with an actual conservative pope who's going to uphold Catherine doctrine in the way that we're [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=818.48s)]
*  used to, maybe bring back the Latin mass, get right with the messaging when it comes to a wall [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=823.12s)]
*  and immigration, things like that. Let's find out. We're going to find out very soon. It's exciting. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=829.52s)]
*  Maybe we'll get you a picture of the white smoke momentarily, but let's go back to [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=835.6s)]
*  white man, old white man, Joe Biden. Here he is. Let's see if he's doing any better on his [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=841.6s)]
*  rambling. Okay. Let's check in and stop 37. I know it wasn't going to happen right away. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=850.48s)]
*  The project, the benefits. How do you lead the world without having the best infrastructure? [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=858.72s)]
*  How do you lead the world without having the best healthcare in the world? How do you lead the world [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=863.44s)]
*  without having the best education system? How do you lead the world when you don't have that done? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=866.8000000000001s)]
*  And it all set up to do it. And last thing, I thought what he would do, I thought he'd come [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=871.7600000000001s)]
*  along and be smart. I shouldn't say it. I thought he'd come along and say, and say he did it. Look, [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=877.5200000000001s)]
*  when you have the lovely lady from North Carolina, who talked about me with such affection, saying, [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=884.72s)]
*  Joe Biden did more than anybody did. And so on as a criticism. Remember? I ran as an ad. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=893.5200000000001s)]
*  My point is that I thought he'd say, no, I brought you this. I brought you this. I brought you that. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=903.0400000000001s)]
*  I brought it. And we actually, this is a guy who left with the largest deficit any president [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=911.12s)]
*  has added when he was last time president. Cut it to his choice. What's it all about? [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=916.8000000000001s)]
*  Cut all these programs. Okay. Okay. All right. To quote the great Archie Bunker. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=923.0400000000001s)]
*  I mean, his hangers on are the greediest people. They are so greedy. I mean, like, [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=934.24s)]
*  have you not pondered enough? Let the man stay home. Like, don't put him out there. He can't [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=941.7600000000001s)]
*  handle it. How much money do these greedy people need? I mean, they need to line the pockets of [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=947.12s)]
*  the assisted living facility to let him out. So Ashbrook touched on it. Smug. You just nailed it. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=952.24s)]
*  Here's what Halperin said earlier this morning on his YouTube show, Two Way. Watch. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=957.6s)]
*  Biden's doing this to fight back or Biden's doing this for his reputation. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=963.2s)]
*  I talked to someone very familiar with the Bidens. And I think they've pointed out something that I'm [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=966.5600000000001s)]
*  going to say now that to me is the explanation, or at least part of the explanation, which is [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=972.4s)]
*  Biden Inc. has collapsed. All those Biden grandkids had a lavish lifestyle, which they very much [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=977.84s)]
*  liked. Hunter made hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars. Joe, as a former [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=984.0s)]
*  president, is not in a position to get the same kind of paid speeches, corporate boards, book deal. [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=989.76s)]
*  Biden Inc. needs a source of revenue. And Hunter does, even though he was pardoned, he's not going [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=996.0s)]
*  to prison. Hunter does not have great earning capacity. The trough is empty. The spigot has [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1001.04s)]
*  shut down. They need a way to get back in the game to make big money to have the grandchildren [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1006.56s)]
*  fed and clothed and flown first class, et cetera. How do you like that one, guys? [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1012.0s)]
*  Mark is very, very smart, but I disagree with him in one key area. He said Hunter doesn't have great [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1019.28s)]
*  earning capacity. The guy is a painter. He's a celebrated artist. And these things sell for [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1025.6s)]
*  hundreds of thousands of dollars, millions of dollars all across New York. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1032.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure that'll continue. [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1036.1599999999999s)]
*  Certainly that would continue. You know, I mean, look, he totally nailed it. This has been true of [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1037.84s)]
*  the Bidens forever. As we've come to find out during the course of his administration, things [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1042.24s)]
*  that we knew when we were in the Senate years and years ago, is Biden Inc. is a very real thing. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1046.0s)]
*  And they're right. But it's an interesting strategy, right? If they're using him, throwing [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1050.8s)]
*  him back out there to try to reignite interest in the Bidens and restart the power of Biden [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1056.4s)]
*  Inc. to generate cash, you got to say something that is like a little bit interesting. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1063.36s)]
*  If he takes that question about Kamala and he's like, yeah, she wasn't the best candidate. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1069.2s)]
*  Lee, Lee, North Carolina. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1073.3600000000001s)]
*  The other dynamic that is just over the horizon, there are a bunch of books that are tell-alls [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1077.76s)]
*  about how bad Joe Biden was over the last year. And those are going to be coming out over the next [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1083.5200000000002s)]
*  six months. And I think that they're trying to get ahead of some of that. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1088.0s)]
*  What else is about to come out? You guys read it in Politico. It looks like the Trump [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1090.96s)]
*  administration is going to release the audio of the Her Report. He was deemed a well-meaning [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1096.0800000000002s)]
*  elderly man with a poor memory. Couldn't remember when his son, Bo, died, when he was vice president. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1102.56s)]
*  That's not going to go well. And they could be trying to get ahead of that as well. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1110.3999999999999s)]
*  Here's a little bit more. Speaking of those around him who covered up his infirmity, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1114.24s)]
*  or at least that's where my mind went. Dr. Jill was there too. And as usual, came to the rescue. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1121.2s)]
*  Watch SOT 38. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1127.36s)]
*  What is your response to these allegations? Are these sources wrong? [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1128.6399999999999s)]
*  They are wrong. There's nothing to sustain that, number one. Number two, you know, [[00:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1133.36s)]
*  think about what we're left with. We're left with a circumstance where we had an insurrection [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1140.96s)]
*  when I started. That nonsense of a civil war. We had a circumstance where we were in a position that [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1148.0s)]
*  we, well, the pandemic, because of the incompetence of the last outfit, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1155.36s)]
*  ended up over a million people dying. A million people dying. We're also in a situation where [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1161.68s)]
*  we found ourselves unable to deal with a lot of just basic issues. And that won't go into [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1167.84s)]
*  interest of time. And so we went to work and we got it done. And, you know, one of the things that, [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1176.64s)]
*  well, I'm talking too long. [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, and Elissa, you know, one of the things I think is that the people who wrote those books [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1186.08s)]
*  were not in the White House with us. And they didn't see how hard Joe worked every single day. [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1191.84s)]
*  I mean, he'd get up, he'd put in a full day. And then at night he would, I'd be in bed, [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1199.9199999999998s)]
*  you know, reading my book and he was still on the phone reading his briefings, [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1206.48s)]
*  working with staff. I mean, it was nonstop. It's the White House being president is not like a job. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1212.3999999999999s)]
*  It's a lifestyle. It's a life that you live. You live it 24 hours a day. That phone can ring at [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1219.6799999999998s)]
*  11 o'clock at night or two in the morning. It's constant. You never leave it. And Joe [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1226.64s)]
*  worked really hard. I think he was a great president. And if you look at things today, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1233.2800000000002s)]
*  give me Joe Biden anytime. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1244.48s)]
*  Okay. Can I just say a couple of things about this? First of all, she's, she, she's reminding me of [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1248.16s)]
*  Jordan, Bill Belichick's girlfriend. Those two are the same person in the same relationship [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1253.12s)]
*  in different ways. Second of all, she says, none of these people writing the books worked for us. [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1261.52s)]
*  Well, one of the first to have his book hit interviewed Ron Klain, who was Joe Biden's [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1268.08s)]
*  chief of staff for almost all of his presidency. And he went on the record saying that Biden [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1275.1999999999998s)]
*  thought he was president of NATO. Weren't we together when that broke? Didn't we talk about [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1282.08s)]
*  this? You thought he was president of NATO and didn't realize he was president of the United [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1286.8s)]
*  States. That is where was that follow up? Ladies of the view, I must have missed it. [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1291.76s)]
*  There's, there's something just totally absurd about all of this, right? You got [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1298.96s)]
*  Jill Biden stepping in there and saying late night briefings, phone calls while I'm in bed [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1302.48s)]
*  and I'm reading my book and Joe's still working. Like, let me assure you the youthful vigor of the [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1308.24s)]
*  man who couldn't complete answering this question. It doesn't make any sense. The guy, the guy's on [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1312.88s)]
*  this. He's sitting next to you falling asleep. Yeah. Yeah. I think it goes back to the same [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1318.24s)]
*  thing we said earlier about with Kamala Harris. I kept replying or kept repeating the line of [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1323.28s)]

*  next to a skeleton nodding off and you're saying, listen, he works so hard. He puts in these long [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1331.52s)]
*  hours. If you have to keep telling people, oh, he's, he's fine. He keeps working these long, [[00:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1336.4s)]
*  hard hours. No one believes it. And every time you say it, they believe it less and less. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1340.3200000000002s)]

*  the floor. And they can't do it. They can't do a live follow up. You know, they can't, it's not, [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1352.4s)]
*  if you just stay, stay steeped in the news, you could easily say, well, his chief of staff went [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1357.3600000000001s)]
*  on the record and said the following. Maybe their producers behind the scenes need to get smarter [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1361.68s)]

*  or that none of his staff members wrote these books. Here is your followup, you Nimrods, [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1370.48s)]

*  It's incredibly frustrating. And pro tip for, for Biden's weekend at Bernie's crew, who like [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1378.8s)]

*  Everyone's already figured out that's just a crutch because he's already lost. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1389.36s)]
*  That's dementia. He's got to find another crutch. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1391.68s)]
*  Yeah. That in my opinion, that's a clear sign of dementia. I've seen people I know struggling [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1396.16s)]

*  I went woke up with him. I went to bed at night with him. So I saw him all throughout the day and [[00:24:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1451.28s)]
*  I did not create a cocoon around him. I mean, you saw him in the office. You saw him making speeches. [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1457.1200000000001s)]
*  He wasn't hiding somewhere. I didn't have him, you know, sequestered in some place. I mean, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1464.16s)]

*  the United States who left office like, I don't know, 120 days ago or so. I mean, he was ahead of [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1502.24s)]

*  women are extremely dumb because this should be the easiest interview in the history of [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1549.76s)]
*  interviews that they do. We all live this. We saw his presidency. We saw the campaign. We saw him [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1555.04s)]
*  drop out. The fact that they have to read from a script about these questions, like they aren't [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1559.28s)]
*  obvious questions that anybody who's on television should be able to say without a script. It's crazy. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1564.48s)]

*  Yeah. Yeah. Let's be specific here. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1573.68s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi, Barack and Michelle. Like, who specifically are you thinking about? Let's go [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1575.76s)]
*  through it. Who do you feel betrayed by? Name names. Pelosi did. Pelosi went out there on a [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1580.8799999999999s)]
*  book tour. She spoke about this a lot. Why won't like Michelle Obama? They don't like her. So why [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1585.28s)]
*  wouldn't they? And the view doesn't want to hear it. That's the reason. No, they're just a full [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1589.92s)]

*  really juicy tell all that everyone. A lot of people in DC already know the story about the [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1603.36s)]
*  animosity and the hatred between the Obamas and the Bidens between how Michelle Obama is like [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1607.68s)]
*  very good friends with Hunter Biden's ex and they helped knife each other up and how Joe Biden has [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1614.3999999999999s)]

*  Biden's pride by loaning him money because the Bidens were broke. Like this is a huge story. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1626.72s)]
*  If the American people saw so bad that during the Democratic National Convention on Obama night, [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1632.48s)]
*  Biden and Joe went to Milwaukee outside of Chicago because they didn't couldn't be in the same [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1639.04s)]

*  dumbasses that are sitting up there like, well, tell us about all your successes again. What makes [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1648.88s)]

*  to these Democrats who like they're owed the truth, right? They're owed the truth of this [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1658.64s)]
*  because they got embarrassed in November. And if they're ever going to figure out what they're [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1663.44s)]
*  doing as a party, like you actually have to ask the tough questions. And if they're not going to [[00:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1667.44s)]
*  do that, hey, great for us. We love it. And it's great content, but what a disservice. Like if you [[00:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1671.3600000000001s)]
*  want to know why your ratings are in the toilet, it's because of this. I mean, think about the [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1675.92s)]
*  Republican Party and the right after Romney lost, it turned into a bath of knives and and [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1680.0s)]
*  recusations of trying to figure out what happened. And then you got President Trump out of it. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1686.8s)]
*  Yeah, right. And they're, they're not doing that at all. Who, by the way, Trump, of course, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1690.9599999999998s)]
*  he spun the wisdom after Romney, which was we need comprehensive immigration reform. We need [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1697.6799999999998s)]
*  to pack the citizenship for the illegals. And Trump came out in 15 saying F all of that. We're [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1703.4399999999998s)]
*  not doing any of that. And you know, that was the beginning of Trump not being beholden to any party [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1709.76s)]
*  dogma, just saying I see it very differently and I will say it differently. And I'm doing it [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1715.68s)]
*  differently. Okay. Speaking of doing things differently, Casey Means is the new surgeon [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1720.0800000000002s)]
*  general nominee who this audience knows because she's been on the program many times. He pulled [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1727.92s)]
*  Dr. Janet Neshawat, who was the sister in law of Mike Walls. And my information is that's why she [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1732.8s)]
*  was chosen. I was told that by somebody who is in a position to know and Trump liked her because [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1740.72s)]
*  he saw her on Fox News. She's beautiful and she goes on Fox and you know, obviously that gives you [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1746.24s)]
*  a leg up with the president. But she didn't seem like the right person for the job. First of all, [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1750.56s)]
*  she went to a Caribbean medical school and I'm sorry, but we all know what that means. Okay, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1756.64s)]
*  she couldn't get into one state side. You don't go to the Caribbean for medical school. If you [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1764.64s)]
*  can get into any med school in the continental 50 United States, that's just how it is. I used [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1768.0s)]

*  urgent care clinic change at the chain. It's like chain medicine. Okay. So that's not ideal, but fine. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1781.76s)]
*  Let's not get obsessed with credentials. That's what the left does. Her real problem was she was [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1788.16s)]
*  pro the masking of children and pushing vaccines for kids under five long past when people like [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1795.12s)]
*  Dr. Marty McCary of Johns Hopkins were writing full op-eds in the wall street journal, opposing [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1806.2399999999998s)]

*  general pick and why I personally have nothing against her, but I'm glad she's gone. She's going [[00:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1826.8s)]
*  to work for Bobby Kennedy in some way in HHS, whatever. Okay. So now he taps Casey Means, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1832.8s)]
*  which I was like, that's amazing. I'm thrilled. I love Casey Means. She's at the heart of Maha. [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1838.8799999999999s)]

*  looking at how chronic disease is everywhere and trying to change that about our society. [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1875.12s)]

*  laden food or ultra processed food or seed oils that are ubiquitous in their environment? How can [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1904.4s)]

*  that these chemicals aren't all over our fruits and vegetables that we give to our kids that we [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1929.2800000000002s)]

*  movingly about how she was, I think she might have been number one or she was definitely at the top [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1952.88s)]
*  of her Stanford undergrad class, at the very top Stanford undergrad, which is not easy, [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1958.32s)]
*  not easy to get into Stanford, nevermind finish at the top. Then she goes to Stanford Medical School, [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1963.36s)]
*  which is also not easy and finishes at the top there. Then she gets a prestigious ear, nose and [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1968.4799999999998s)]
*  throat surgical residency at the University of Oregon. And so she goes up there and is crushing [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1974.0s)]
*  it in her residency. She is within one year of finishing the residency and doing very well. And [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1980.56s)]
*  she says, I cannot do this one minute longer. There was a woman who came in, Casey had to operate [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1987.76s)]
*  on her. She had been in for repeated operations for the same problem of memory serves. And Casey [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1994.8799999999999s)]
*  said to herself, what are we doing? We're not helping. We're just churning and burning the same [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=1999.84s)]
*  quote fixes on these patients and then spitting them back in out into a process where they will [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2007.52s)]
*  not be educated, helped nothing around them will change. And she found it too disheartening [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2012.16s)]
*  to continue. And she went in to her attending physician and said, I'm leaving, I'm leaving the [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2017.92s)]
*  program. He begged her not to, this is in her book and she's given story interviews about it. [[00:33:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2022.64s)]
*  He begged her not to. And she said, I can't do this. So she left and she started her own practice [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2026.96s)]
*  and to get more into functional medicine and started thinking about the things that would [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2031.92s)]
*  ultimately wind up in the book. Good energy would be at the center of the Maha movement. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2036.88s)]
*  Her brother, Callie was going through his own evolution and realizations, having worked for [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2041.68s)]
*  Coca-Cola and came out hard as almost like a whistleblower against what companies like that [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2046.48s)]
*  are doing to us with the sugar and the food supply and the snap program and so on. And they've become [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2051.6s)]
*  very important and essential Americans, especially when it comes to Maha. Great. So why is she getting [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2056.7200000000003s)]
*  mercilessly attacked right now by some within the Maha movement and by Laura Loomer, who I don't know [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2066.64s)]
*  if she's in, if she considers herself Maha. And I really don't dismiss Laura Loomer because [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2076.24s)]
*  people call her a conspiracy theorist. She's been right about a lot. Okay. So people need to know [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2083.6s)]
*  that because her critics just dismiss her as like some conspiracy theorist. She's been right about [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2089.2s)]
*  a lot. And I've watched it myself on this program because I came to her very open-minded. Is she [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2094.48s)]
*  conspiracy theorist? We were all supposedly conspiracy theorists. So what's the story? [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2099.04s)]
*  She's really taking aim at Casey. And I have to say on this one, I really disagree. I disagree [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2103.52s)]
*  strongly because I'm just going to tell you some of the allegations. Okay. She said, hold on, [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2108.72s)]
*  give me a little piece of paper because I wrote, write this stuff down. Okay. She said that Casey [[00:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2114.72s)]
*  means her dad wrote a pro trans children's book back in 2020. Well, he did write a book that was [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2121.92s)]
*  about like a weird, an odd duckling or goose and how it wound up, it basically wound up being gay. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2128.88s)]
*  And in the opening to the book, he does say that this is, it's about Felix, a unique bird. [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2136.8s)]
*  And he says, it's a story for children and adults alike. And says, it's, it's for, I'm trying to find [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2143.84s)]
*  the exact quote, but it's about, oh, coming of age is challenging for most children, but it can [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2150.88s)]
*  be especially tough for those grappling with their gender and sexual identities, gender. So he mentions [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2155.28s)]
*  it. And the, but I've looked at the book, at least what I can find of it. I have like four pages [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2161.52s)]
*  and it's really about a gay goose. Okay. It's like, it's not really about the trans issue, [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2167.2000000000003s)]
*  even though they mentioned gender. Um, it doesn't love a gay goose as a gay goose. Okay. Whatever. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2171.92s)]
*  By the way, it's her father. It's not her. Like I don't, okay. So like if she had written this, [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2178.24s)]
*  maybe it would lead to a follow-up question at the hearings. Like, what, what do you think about, [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2183.7599999999998s)]
*  you know, children grappling with their gender identities? That's really the question, isn't it? [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2189.68s)]
*  What does Casey Means think about children wrestling with their gender identities? [[00:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2193.6s)]
*  And I can tell you something guys, because I know Casey Means, I know her from the many [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2198.56s)]
*  times I've had her on this program and I've talked to her off this program. She is where I am [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2203.2s)]
*  on this. She is not pro the transing of children at all. Her brother, Callie right now is out there [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2209.4399999999996s)]
*  calling it demonic. They're very close. She hasn't spoken to it as far as I know publicly, [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2216.16s)]
*  because I know no one's asked her. Everybody's much more focused on like functional health, [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2221.2s)]
*  but she is not going to be in any way, shape or form supportive of puberty blockers for minors, [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2225.84s)]
*  cross sex hormones for minors or surgeries for minors. [[00:37:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2234.08s)]
*  And if somehow I am proven wrong and I won't be, I will personally lobby the president to fire her. [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2238.16s)]
*  I will personally lobby the president's fire, which I'm not going to have to because I've spoken [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2245.12s)]
*  to her. I know this is firsthand reporting how she feels about it. Okay. So that's that. That's [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2249.28s)]
*  number one. Then she points out, Loomer does that she never completed her residency. That is true. [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2255.28s)]
*  I just gave you the context. She points out she does not even have an active medical license in [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2262.1600000000003s)]
*  Oregon. That's true because she decided to stop practicing medicine a couple of years into her [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2267.28s)]
*  private practice. And to do, she has this company now that offers like all day glucose monitoring [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2272.48s)]
*  and explains to people how to read their blood levels when they get their lab tests back and [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2280.56s)]
*  so on. It just sort of helps more millions as opposed to like individuals. And I can speak [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2285.12s)]
*  this as a lawyer. I passed the bar in New York, in Illinois and in Massachusetts. Okay. So I was [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2290.2400000000002s)]
*  admitted in all those states. I practice at length in New York state, in Chicago, in Washington, [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2296.96s)]
*  DC for that matter. And I wound up going dormant on all of my law licenses many years into joining [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2302.64s)]
*  journalism full-time because A, it costs money and B, it's a lot of continuing legal education. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2310.4s)]
*  And in her case, medical education, a lot. It's demanding, there's a lot of bar fees, [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2318.16s)]
*  there are pains in the ass to maintain. And if you're really not going to be practicing, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2322.8s)]
*  it's pointless to do it. She's still a doctor, but she just chose not to stay licensed so that she [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2326.96s)]
*  could actually practice medicine right now. She could get that license back like that. Right? So [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2331.76s)]
*  it's like, and not for nothing, but all the continuing medical education, half of it is [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2335.76s)]
*  pushed by big pharma, more than half probably. So it's like, what? We're upset she wouldn't go [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2339.52s)]
*  right back into the system that is corrupting our doctors that we're complaining about that actually [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2344.1600000000003s)]
*  happens to be her life mission now to combat. It makes no sense. So there's all that. I think [[00:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2348.32s)]
*  that's basically it. I've hit the biggest things. Laura's upset too that she's a little like out [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2354.1600000000003s)]
*  there in some of her spiritual practices. She pulled up her newsletter, Casey Means's, where [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2360.48s)]
*  she said she talked about how these are the things I did to try to tap into the mystical side of [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2366.56s)]
*  evolving my consciousness and being ready for partnership, like looking for a man, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2374.64s)]
*  which she did find and she got married. Here are a few. She said, I don't necessarily recommend [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2379.6s)]
*  these, but these were part of my journey. I set up a small meditation shrine in my house. I prayed [[00:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2384.4s)]
*  to photos of my ancestors asking for support on my journey. I went to weekly group meditations [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2389.52s)]
*  and spiritual lectures in order to tune in with the spirit. I work with a spiritual medium who [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2396.4s)]
*  helped me try to connect with my spirit guides for support and guidance. My therapist who helped [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2401.68s)]
*  me get out of my first marriage wanted me to be doing all this stuff. It didn't speak to me [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2405.7599999999998s)]
*  personally. This is actually an established lane for people who are struggling, especially in [[00:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2409.68s)]
*  relationships. I hiked alone and talked literally out loud to the trees, letting them know I was [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2415.44s)]
*  ready for partnership. I pursued visualization techniques that helped me see my visions for [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2420.08s)]
*  the future. I did plant medicine experiences with trusted guides and wrote extensively about my [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2426.48s)]
*  experience and insights. She's admitted and she said in her book, she did psychedelics, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2431.36s)]
*  which does have a way of making people feel more connected with mother earth and the universe, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2436.96s)]
*  whatever. All that's part of her journey. She's been very open about it, but she's got a little [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2441.6800000000003s)]
*  Eastern medicine in there, but she's a very Western medicine too and sees all of its problems, [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2447.44s)]
*  all of its problems. Then you got the hardcore anti-vaxxers who want her to come out and condemn [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2453.28s)]
*  the fact that anyone is still taking the COVID vaccine. I have news for those people. [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2459.52s)]
*  She would be totally unconfirmable, totally unconfirmable. He cannot choose somebody [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2465.6s)]
*  who feels that way as controversial as most of us find the vaccine at this point. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2473.52s)]
*  So that's my take on her. I think she is the antidote to most of the problems we all see right [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2477.92s)]
*  now in the medical field, in the medical industrial complex. She and her brother, [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2486.72s)]
*  Callie, are warriors for revolution within our healthcare system. I am 110% behind both of them, [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2491.12s)]
*  including Casey Means for Surgeon General. Any thoughts? [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2501.04s)]
*  Yeah. What a brave thing to do to study your whole life to get into the medical field. We all know [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2504.48s)]
*  how hard that is to do, how much it costs, how much time. You give your entire life to this, [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2510.16s)]
*  all those years of schooling and whatnot. Then find yourself at the end of this process in the [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2514.56s)]
*  medical field where you're putting band-aids over bullet holes in somebody's health, problems that [[00:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2521.36s)]
*  are chronic. The problems people show up at the hospital with, very rarely do they just happen [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2527.84s)]
*  like that. It took 10 years. So to witness that on a daily basis and then be like, [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2534.08s)]
*  I'm going to change my whole life and be an advocate for a broader look at medicine, [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2539.6s)]
*  that's a brave thing to do. To step away from the thing that you put your life into to look [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2545.52s)]
*  at health more holistically. Do I love the woo-woo stuff about talking to trees? No, but also like, [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2551.04s)]
*  welcome to the big 10 of MAGA politics. This is what it is. That's how Donald Trump became [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2557.6s)]
*  President of the United States. There's nothing wrong with being spiritual. [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2563.2s)]
*  Joe Rogan takes ayahuasca. I don't take ayahuasca. I like Joe Rogan. [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2566.0s)]
*  I know a lot of people who are very spiritual and they do things like this. The whole push is to get [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2574.08s)]
*  more in touch with nature, literally to walk barefoot. That whole touch grass thing is actual. [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2579.6800000000003s)]
*  It's real. It's called grounding. It's supposed to, according to some, counteract the nonstop [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2586.08s)]
*  EMFs and radio frequencies that are everywhere. I don't know whether any of that's true, but [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2593.44s)]
*  I have seen support for it from doctors I trust who are more Western medicine based. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2598.16s)]
*  In any event, even if you don't believe it counteracts EMF, it's of course good for you [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2603.12s)]
*  to go outside, to smell the air, to see the sunlight, to take in some vitamin D. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2608.96s)]
*  That's kind of what she said. She writes in her book about it when her mom died of pancreatic [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2615.2000000000003s)]
*  cancer. She had spent the last weeks and months with her, how deeply traumatic it was and how [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2619.36s)]
*  angry it made her at the healthcare system. This was a couple of years after she left the residency [[00:43:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2625.6s)]
*  because the mother had all the signs that people listening to this may be experiencing right now [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2630.6400000000003s)]
*  with a family member where it was like, oh, your blood pressure is a little high. Why don't you go [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2634.96s)]
*  on, you know, Crestor or some other statin? Okay, no problem. Oh, you know, you're a little overweight. [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2639.2000000000003s)]
*  Today they say go on a Zempik, right, which wasn't around when she was here. Oh, you've got [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2647.8399999999997s)]
*  pre-diabetes, but it's nothing to worry about. You know, we can manage it with these medicines. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2654.08s)]
*  And then of course it turns into full diabetes. And now you're actually really in trouble and [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2658.16s)]
*  in danger. And ultimately her mom who'd been on this downward path on her health, [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2662.0s)]
*  and it's not that the doctors didn't care about her, it's that the whole system is set up to do [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2666.96s)]
*  this, to just medicalize, you know, drug respond with like, what's the word, just with pharmacy, [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2670.56s)]
*  just respond with pharmacy options. Ultimately, she gets pancreatic cancer in her, I think young [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2677.6s)]
*  seventies. And Casey writes about how when they buried her, they chose to bury her not in a casket. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2684.16s)]
*  Like this is the thing you can do at certain cemeteries where like that's what her mom wanted [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2691.44s)]
*  to be like, given to have your body actually given back to the earth, like true ashes to ashes, [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2696.56s)]
*  dust to dust. And how it's like, you know, like that, that your remains could actually lead to [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2702.08s)]
*  the growth of something beautiful on this earth at some point. I don't think there's anything wrong [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2708.7999999999997s)]
*  with that. That's, I applaud having somebody in a position to be a spokesperson that she's not [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2713.44s)]
*  setting, you know, health policy. That's Bobby Kennedy. That's going to be Jade Badacharya. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2719.7599999999998s)]
*  It's really the spokesperson for public health. Believing in that kind of thing and understanding [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2725.04s)]
*  medicine doesn't have to be totally limited to what comes out of a needle. [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2731.1200000000003s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, I think there's a lot to be said about that. I had family who is prescribed, I mean, [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2737.1200000000003s)]
*  you name it. They, like you said, the whole story is just so familiar. It's like, okay, you have [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2745.1200000000003s)]
*  pre diabetes, give them this, give them this, give them this. And then now you're dealing with [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2748.7200000000003s)]
*  all the side effects that, you know, you have an elderly individual who's now on a battery of these [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2753.04s)]
*  medications. It's like, is this truly the best lifestyle that you're affording these people? [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2756.9599999999996s)]
*  And how did this become absolute? You just accepted that when you walk into a doctor's office, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2761.6s)]
*  the notepad is going to be from one pharma company. They're going to have a little clipboard [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2768.8799999999997s)]
*  from another pharma company. The pen's going to be from another pharma company. It's like, [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2772.4799999999996s)]
*  did I walk in to get health treatment or is this like a NASCAR ad where everyone's got their sticker [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2775.6s)]
*  of who's sponsoring them all over the place? This is how we take care of people. And, you know, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2779.92s)]
*  when you bring up Bobby Kennedy, there was a YouTube video that he put up, me and my wife [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2785.28s)]
*  saw it about a year ago, where he was talking about things like the food colorings that is [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2789.2000000000003s)]
*  in so much of our food in America, which is banned in Europe and every Western, every civilized [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2793.6800000000003s)]
*  country on earth has banned all these substances that are being thrown in foods that and drinks [[00:46:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2799.04s)]
*  that we get that are put on like snap benefits so that now you're poisoning entire group of people. [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2803.76s)]
*  You're making kids dependent because poor people, you know, getting them addicted to these products. [[00:46:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2809.68s)]
*  And then now you're wondering why is it that we pay more for health care and end up with worse [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2815.68s)]
*  outcomes? We really want to continue this of the same people calling the shots, then getting, [[00:46:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2819.84s)]
*  you know, once they're done with their job as a surgeon general, now they're going to their [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2825.2s)]
*  consultancy with a pharma company. It's like, at some point we have to stop and think that this [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2829.7599999999998s)]
*  system that we've put in place isn't working for it's making things worse and worse. But we should [[00:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2834.48s)]
*  be able to have both, right? Like we should be able to have like life changing drugs that save [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2838.7200000000003s)]
*  people's lives. Like think about like, you know, somebody has a stroke, you know, and they go to [[00:47:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2844.56s)]
*  the hospital and they can give them a clot buster that clears out the stroke and literally save [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2849.6s)]
*  somebody's life. But like not every medical intervention needs to be a crisis intervention [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2853.28s)]
*  at that last moment, right? Like it's broadening the aperture of what health is in this country [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2858.88s)]
*  and the way we can take care of ourselves to avoid those things. This is sort of the problem [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2864.08s)]
*  with politics, particularly in a modern age where everybody's got a hot take about everything. Like [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2868.24s)]
*  I just don't think this is this difficult, right? The thing that you just had is absolutely right. [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2872.4s)]
*  We have life saving medication that comes happens to come from a pharma medic operation. Okay, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2876.08s)]
*  that's a good thing. That's a good thing. Should they control the entire industry? Health to nuts? [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2881.7599999999998s)]
*  No. But like you're a human, you have rational, logical processes that go into any of that. She [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2886.16s)]
*  sounds like a pretty thoughtful lady, you know, so she likes to go outside and wander through the [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2892.16s)]
*  woods. Well, you know, like I like to have 15 beers and go to the golf course. Like this is normal [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2896.3199999999997s)]
*  life stuff. Yeah. But like, you know, in terms of whether she is exactly aligned, I mean, her father [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2903.2799999999997s)]
*  writing a book, well, wait till she finds out a family of RFK really going to hang back. That's a [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2913.04s)]
*  hell of a lot worse than a gay goose. I'll tell you that. Okay, so she doesn't have the medical [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2920.16s)]
*  license. That's not it's not like it got pulled from her, etc. Like this is this is not an issue. [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2928.56s)]
*  Like she doesn't she's not going to be practicing medicine as surgeon general. The whole point is [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2933.2799999999997s)]
*  like, are you qualified to talk about the public health system? And she's beyond qualified. And not [[00:48:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2937.8399999999997s)]
*  for nothing. But the last surgeon general, the vague murty under Obama and then resurrected again [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2943.2s)]
*  under Joe Biden had perfect credentials. He was double Harvard. He had worked for all the right [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2949.92s)]
*  public service groups trying to help all these kids around the world with AIDS and HIV and all [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2956.4s)]
*  the things that the left would completely praise. And what did he do as surgeon general? He shoved [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2961.04s)]
*  those vaccines down the throats of the American people and their children. He just like the first [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2966.88s)]
*  woman Trump nominated, but even worse, pushed masking at every turn, including on children. [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2974.4s)]
*  He downplayed the risk of myocarditis to teenagers being forced to take their seventh booster. [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2980.32s)]
*  I don't care about his perfect credentials. I would take Casey Means over that guy every day [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2986.2400000000002s)]
*  of the week. And there's nothing wrong with her. I mean, honestly, like everything that's been raised [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2992.2400000000002s)]
*  about her gives me zero pause. Zero pause. I listen, I totally agree. You'd be better off having no [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=2997.52s)]
*  surgeon general at all than having somebody like the last cat that you just described. I mean, [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3004.24s)]
*  that was a nightmare scenario for the American people and a whole generation of children of which [[00:50:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3008.16s)]
*  we have a collective sum here on the variety program. But this lady seems really thoughtful. [[00:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3012.9599999999996s)]
*  I don't know a lot about her. What I do know largely comes from you and your interviews with [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3019.6s)]
*  her. But boy, wouldn't it be nice to have somebody that's just sort of outside the box. And by the [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3024.72s)]
*  way, understands that a key component of the Trump coalition was the maha. [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3029.44s)]
*  You should. Exactly right. And without Casey, I don't even know if you would have had RFKJ [[00:50:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3033.6s)]
*  and his endorsement of Trump and so on. All right, we're going to take a pause, take a break. We'll be [[00:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3039.04s)]
*  right back. If you haven't heard about Riverbend Ranch, listen up. They have just introduced their [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3042.48s)]

*  Riverbend Ranch never uses growth hormones or antibiotics. They treat their animals humanely [[00:51:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3065.28s)]
*  and with respect. There are advantages of buying directly from the ranch. They can track the health [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3071.04s)]

*  of the beef. They age their beef to perfection for 21 days. You simply cannot buy beef like this in a [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3092.96s)]
*  grocery store. You cannot ship directly from the ranch to your home. You get a much better price [[00:51:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3099.2799999999997s)]

*  better and for the worse. And Pope Francis was controversial you know the truly like deeply [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3186.0s)]
*  religious observant Catholics were split on him because he was so socially quote progressive. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3191.76s)]
*  But I will tell you this. I've said this story but just long version is short version is like [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3199.44s)]

*  with the middleman like why you know like our evangelical friends they don't there's no middleman [[00:53:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3211.0400000000004s)]

*  I was thinking about wandering outside of the Catholic Church so I wandered over to a [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3223.36s)]
*  Presbyterian service thinking they're looser maybe this is like the place for me where I don't [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3228.48s)]
*  I don't know I'll have to investigate the whole homily was about transing children and how it's [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3234.96s)]
*  good and we needed to support it how like a sign from the Lord. The thing about the Catholic Church [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3240.6400000000003s)]
*  even under Pope Francis who was like the most progressive Pope we've had in my lifetime is [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3245.92s)]
*  they hold the line on the core things that matter to most Catholics whether it's abortion or [[00:54:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3251.36s)]
*  transing children. They're not big on gay marriage something I have attended and support for my [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3261.04s)]
*  friends but I understand the controversy around it. So there's a very firm strict moral code [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3268.8s)]
*  and I have to say I find that very attractive I like that I don't like wishy-washiness like you [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3276.0s)]

*  the Trump administration's Department of Health and Human Services to stop research activities [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3744.0s)]
*  the research pause is the latest disruption to federal science agencies after HHS secretary [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=3749.68s)]

*  the pope of the whole world and you know as americans especially we get zeroed in on politics [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UbUG4pC02MY&t=5600.88s)]
