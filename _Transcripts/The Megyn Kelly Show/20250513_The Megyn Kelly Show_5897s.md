Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Buck Sexton, co-host of The Clay and Buck Show, to discuss new reporting that former President Biden might need a wheelchair if he won the election, top Dems and the corporate press working overtime to cover-up his physical and cognitive decline, the truth about Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson's new book, the press getting major stories wrong on purpose, how they will never apologize for what they screw up because it serves an agenda, the leftist media fixating on Trump bringing white Afrikaners into America who are seeking refuge, the insane double standard by the left and their racist comments, and more. Then attorneys Mark Eiglarsh and Mark Geragos join to discuss the disturbing new details coming out at the Diddy trial, inside story about the lawyers and judge, recent details surrounding the Menendez brothers case, Geragos' and Megyn and Justin Baldoni's lawyer Bryan Freedman's efforts to get the brothers out of prison, bombshell new reporting about Bryan Kohberger’s disturbing phone searches after the Idaho murders, his association with serial killer Ted Bundy, the timeline of the crimes and what the defense could be planning, and more.

# New Biden and Wheelchair Reporting, and Disturbing Diddy Details, w/ Buck Sexton, Eiglarsh & Geragos
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 13, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Later today, Kelly's court is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=0.0s)]
*  back and we have a doozy of a court for you today. Explosive developments in the Diddy trial, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4.8s)]
*  the Weinstein retrial, and some major new developments in the Brian Kohlberger case, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=11.36s)]
*  as that's barreling toward trial this summer. But we begin today with the news as President [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=17.6s)]
*  Trump begins his Middle East trip. President Biden is back in the spotlight. And how? The [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=22.88s)]
*  first details from the book by Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson, Original Sin, which comes out next [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=28.16s)]
*  week, have hit the public. The Guardian got a copy and they include the detail that President [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=34.32s)]
*  Biden's aides were so worried about his quote, physical deterioration beginning in 2023, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=39.92s)]
*  that they discussed plans to potentially use a wheelchair if he were reelected, but understood [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=46.24s)]
*  that they could not put him in one during the campaign because it would be politically [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=53.68s)]
*  devastating. The extent of the fraud that was committed upon us by these absolute ne'er-do-wells [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=59.12s)]
*  remains shocking. We should not lose our ability to be shocked just because he lost. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=65.6s)]
*  This is a true outrage. What they tried to do to us, F these people and their massive fraud. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  And where is the commission that's getting to the bottom of all this? I'm starting to turn my view [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=79.92s)]
*  on these leftist reporters who are suddenly doing these books because they actually do have good [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=87.68s)]
*  connections inside team Biden. And we're getting some very telling details. Why didn't we know this [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=93.52s)]
*  in 2023? We're going to get into all of this with Buck Sexton. He's our first guest today, co-host of [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=100.72s)]
*  The Clay Travis and Buck Sexton Show and a new dad. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=106.08s)]
*  on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. Since President Trump's election, the eyes of [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=114.0s)]
*  the nation have been on Mar-a-Lago and the free state of Florida. It is a thriving, booming place. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=119.67999999999999s)]
*  South Florida is a special place because of its amazing water for boating, swimming, fishing and [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=125.28s)]
*  drinking. Well, today, clean water is endangered by toxic algae. Did you know that? You may have [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=130.08s)]
*  heard of red tide or blue green algae. It can be dangerous and it can be gross. In his first term, [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=136.0s)]
*  President Trump signed a law to solve the problem with a new reservoir south of Lake Okeechobee [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=141.76000000000002s)]
*  to keep clean, fresh water flowing constantly to South Florida. President Trump said after years [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=148.08s)]
*  of rebuilding other nations, we are finally rebuilding our nation. Washington can finish [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=154.0s)]
*  the job in next year's budget and keep President Trump's promise. The Everglades Foundation, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=159.2s)]
*  our advertiser, says that would be very good for Florida and good for the Everglades. Learn [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=164.56s)]
*  more about President Trump's Everglades support project at EvergladesFoundation.org. Buck, welcome [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  to the show and congratulations. Thank you. Being a dad is awesome. It's been a lot of fun. A few [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=177.76s)]
*  weeks in. It's great. Good. How's your wife? She's good. I have to stop telling her that I want to [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=183.04s)]
*  have at least three or four kids. I think I got to wait like six months until I continue that [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=190.64s)]
*  conversation. Like she's still recovering from the hospital, but she's amazing. She's a trooper. Yes. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=196.0s)]
*  And kids are, you know, the kid is fantastic. Here are three words you should never say to your wife [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  during this period of having a new baby. I'm so tired. Do not say those words, Buck Sexton. Only [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=205.28s)]
*  your wife is allowed to say those words when the baby is an infant, assuming she's breastfeeding and [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=212.56s)]
*  the one primarily getting up with the baby overnight. I remember looking at Doug saying, [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=217.2s)]
*  you could say that to your friends. You can go say that to your mom and your brothers and sister. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=221.12s)]
*  You may not say that to me. I try to take care of everything non-baby related. So I'm now primary [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=225.76s)]
*  on kitchen cleanup, the dog, you name it, because I'm so thankful that I get to sleep most nights. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=233.04s)]
*  But my one thing, can I just, this might be a little controversial. I'm a little surprised. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=238.88s)]
*  I'm a new parent, right? So it just happened and I was really excited for it, waiting a long time. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=242.4s)]
*  So many people act like I'm about to sign up to be in the trenches in World War I or something. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=247.04s)]
*  They're like, oh man, you better get ready for it. I'm like, it's an amazing little guy who looks [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=252.48s)]
*  like me and my wife. It's like the greatest thing in history. And people act like when they're talking [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=258.8s)]
*  to you about it, it's like a calamity that your life will never be the same. I mean, I know that [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=263.6s)]
*  a little bit of it is tongue in cheek for everybody, but it's the best. It's the best. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=268.56s)]
*  I don't know. I wish I'd done it earlier. That's my only regret. I wish I had started a family [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=272.56s)]
*  younger. I think a lot of people who feel that way did do it earlier. And they went from having [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=277.6s)]
*  these amazing party lives as young people in their twenties to like, whoa, I'm at home all the time. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=281.84000000000003s)]
*  Not in your twenties. I'm not in my twenties and wasn't when I had my first baby. So my life had [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=287.76s)]
*  already downshifted into something more reasonable. So when the kids came, I was like, yeah, this is [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=291.68s)]
*  fine. This is the natural next step. But I think if you were like 24, it would be much more of a [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=295.84s)]
*  shock. Yeah. When you're 40, you've had enough boozy brunches. Like you get it. You know, like [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=300.96s)]
*  I've been to the mountain top with like staying out late at night. And now I'm like, oh, baby wants [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=305.28s)]
*  to go to bed at nine 30. Buck wants to go to bed at nine 30. This is great. Same. Okay. Let's talk [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=310.15999999999997s)]
*  about Biden. This really is pretty shocking. What is in this Tapper book and not just Tapper, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=317.68s)]
*  but Alex Thompson about Joe Biden. So here's a couple of highlights. First of all, the guardian, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=326.96s)]
*  again, which got his hands on the book says as follows, Joe Biden, according to David Pluff, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=333.68s)]
*  who worked to get Barack Obama elected and then came in late to, well, I mean, came in early ish [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=341.04s)]
*  to help Kamala get elected, but was saying the whole process of Kamala happened too late. This [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=347.44s)]
*  is a quote, Joe Biden totally fucked us by leaving it too late to drop out of the 2024 presidential [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=352.0s)]
*  election. Pluff describes Harris's 107 day sprint against Donald Trump as quote, a fucking nightmare. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=358.08s)]
*  That's how we felt on the outside, but I think for different reasons and it's all Biden. He adds, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=367.36s)]
*  he totally F'ed us. Let's see. They said, well, you remember that Pluff had tweeted on X right [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=373.2s)]
*  after she lost that the Harris campaign had begun in a quote, deep hole and later deleted his account [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=379.44s)]
*  because he got so much blowback for saying what was obviously true and goes even further, obviously [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=386.0s)]
*  with those comments to the authors of this book. The book describes how Pluff had received calls [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=391.52s)]
*  from donors worried about Biden's diminishing energy, cognitive skills and ability to deliver [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=397.2s)]
*  a speech. He in turn pressed the white house and democratic party on whether they felt sure [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=401.2s)]
*  that the then president could win another election and was repeatedly told he could. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=406.0s)]
*  An unnamed senior aide admits we shielded him from his own staff quote. We attempted to shield him [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=411.36s)]
*  from his own staff. So many people did not realize the extent of the decline beginning in 2023. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=417.84s)]
*  An unnamed democratic strategist tells the authors it was an abomination, his decision to seek [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=424.64s)]
*  reelection. He stole an election from the democratic party. He stole it from the American people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=432.8s)]
*  and they reveal that president Obama visited the white house in 2023 warning Joe Biden, make sure [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=440.15999999999997s)]
*  you can win. Make sure you can win. On top of that, Axios reports that Biden's aides discussed [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=447.28s)]
*  using a wheelchair if he were reelected. They understood they could not do it until after [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=457.76s)]
*  the election, particularly because of the significant degeneration of his spine [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=464.4s)]
*  and his aides alarm over it as he sought a second term at age 81. His aides believed it was [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=470.4s)]
*  politically untenable to have Biden use a wheelchair during the reelection campaign, [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=475.52s)]
*  but they understood he was likely to need it afterward. And here is the response from team [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=481.28s)]
*  Biden to that report, Naxos. So far, we are still waiting for someone, anyone to point out where [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=487.44s)]
*  Joe Biden had to make a presidential decision or make a presidential address where he was unable [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=496.96s)]
*  to do his job because of mental decline. In fact, the evidence points to the opposite. He was a very [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=502.4s)]
*  effective president. Even Dave Weigel, a leftist is online saying they had six months to come up [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=508.0s)]
*  with a statement. They knew these books are coming and this is that's where they landed, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=514.4s)]
*  point to a decision that he made or couldn't make because of mental decline. So what do you make of [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=518.3199999999999s)]
*  it all? I reject wholesale the narrative that they're trying to peddle now. And I'm going to [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=525.68s)]
*  be very hard on this with anybody who comes forward and tries to act like they're a truth teller. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=532.16s)]
*  And I have the receipts, as the kids say, Megan, because everybody, everybody knew that Joe Biden [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=537.68s)]
*  was in a state of cognitive decline from just watching him on television for years. On my show [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=546.16s)]
*  with Clay, the Clay and Buck show, we were making comments about how this was the weekend at Bernie's [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=551.36s)]
*  presidency. People were writing in their reviews of the movie from the 80s weekend at Bernie's [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=557.44s)]
*  in response to us talking about it so often because, and for those who don't know, it's a [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=562.8000000000001s)]
*  very bad movie, but these guys carry around somebody who's a dead body and they pretend [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=567.7600000000001s)]
*  like he's alive the whole weekend. I talked about the historic El Cid, which is a Charlton Heston [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=572.4000000000001s)]
*  movie. It's based on a guy in the Iberian peninsula who's fighting against the Moors. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  And at the end of the movie, he's dead and they put him on a horse and he leads the final charge [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=583.52s)]
*  while he's dead to scare away the enemy. We were making these jokes, Megan, starting in 2021. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=587.68s)]
*  This was obvious the whole time. And what you're seeing right now from the people writing the books [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=593.28s)]
*  and the people who are giving the leaks and everything else is a circular firing squad [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=599.92s)]
*  within the Democrat party. Because here's what really happened. They tried a con and it didn't [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=604.64s)]
*  work. If it had worked, you know what we'd be sitting around here talking about right now? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=611.04s)]
*  If Joe Biden had managed to stay in and managed to win, they would be talking about how, oh, [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=614.9599999999999s)]
*  what an incredible shift it is now that Kamala Harris is going to have to ascend as his vice [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=621.12s)]
*  president, from vice president and take over for him. The plan, I think, was quite obvious all along. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=626.24s)]
*  Why is it that conservatives, and I think really across the board, I'm not pretending like [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=631.36s)]
*  my show or what I said, we were ahead of the curve on this. It was a laugh line for years that Joe [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=636.16s)]
*  Biden was in some state of cognitive decline. I used to apologize to my audience because I said, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=642.08s)]
*  look, I don't know what else to do. I remember what it was like when my grandfather was having, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=646.96s)]
*  was going through this and it was deeply saddening. And I see this with Joe Biden. I don't want to [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=651.36s)]
*  talk about this. I don't want to talk about his brains being scrambled eggs, but it is obvious. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=656.48s)]
*  We all knew, all these reporters knew they are lying now because they have to figure out a way [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=661.84s)]
*  to regain some credibility and to regain some ground even within their own side, [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=668.72s)]
*  because they made a mockery of their own audience. I mean, look at someone like Morning Joe over on [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=673.36s)]
*  Joe Scarborough. He said, I think it was in March of last year that this was the sharpest version. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=677.4399999999999s)]
*  And he stared into the camera and he lectured people, the sharpest, smartest version of Joe [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=683.68s)]
*  Biden I've ever seen. Not Joe Biden is okay. This is the best Joe Biden I've ever seen. These [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=688.4s)]
*  people are liars. I knew what was going on, Megan. You knew what was going on. They thought they [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=695.1999999999999s)]
*  could pull off the swindle. There is no credit for trying to rewrite history now. It's like, oh, [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=700.9599999999999s)]
*  did you know they were hiding it from aides? This is the emperor's, the emperor's got no clothes. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=706.24s)]
*  He was walking around naked. We could all see it. It's not new. There's, I mean, the stories will [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=711.52s)]
*  be interesting, but they're just trying to tear each other down and shift the blame. [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=716.56s)]
*  Oh, no, I'm, I'm interested in the details. I mean, the fact that the wheelchair that he was [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=720.2399999999999s)]
*  about to go into a wheelchair, but they were just like, just get across the finish line of the [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=723.3599999999999s)]
*  election. We can't put them in that good gracious, right? And it is interesting to finally see, like [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=726.2399999999999s)]
*  I've been waiting for the book about the Kamala Harris disaster and what happened during that [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=730.88s)]
*  camp. That's never come out. You know, this is getting a little closer with David Plouffe talking [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=736.16s)]
*  about it being an effing disaster. What, but that's not about her. That's about Biden waiting too [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=740.4s)]
*  long, but Biden's still denying that he denied that just last week when he went on the view. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=744.8s)]
*  So it is, there is some advantage to having these Democrat insiders go beat up their own side for me [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=749.8399999999999s)]
*  on the outside. It's fascinating to read, but no, that doesn't excuse. I'm going to want to read it. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=756.0799999999999s)]
*  I want to know it. I'm just saying there's no like, oh, I'm speaking to the power. Yeah, it's no, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=760.64s)]
*  no, no, no. I mean, this is nonsense. No, that's why last week I was ripping Alex Thompson, who [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=764.8s)]
*  got this award for, you know, his coverage of the Biden mental infirmity, which he did more than [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=768.8s)]
*  any other on the left. But when he accepted the award at the radio or the Washington, the [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=775.3599999999999s)]
*  White House correspondent center, he was like, we missed it. You know, the people in this room miss [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=779.3599999999999s)]
*  it. They didn't miss it. Exactly. They didn't miss it. They sold their souls to defeat Trump and they [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=786.16s)]
*  failed. And now they're trying to buy them back off of, you know, layaway. Like this is not something [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=790.64s)]
*  that's hard to understand when you look at it in the totality. And again, like I said all along, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=796.0s)]
*  Megan, my bet with Clay, which I ended up having to take him out for the most expensive steak in [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=800.48s)]
*  South Beach, which I didn't even know at the time involved people dancing around and like gold. Oh, [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=805.76s)]
*  yeah, the video is good. It was like, I didn't want to tell you how expensive that steak was, [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=810.16s)]
*  you know, anyway. But the point is I lost our bet. But my bet with him was, and I'm not kidding, [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=813.68s)]
*  Clay, you don't understand. And this was a two year long bet. OK, this was for two years, I was [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=819.28s)]
*  saying leading up to the election, if they have to wheel him out in a wheelchair, and I use those [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=823.6s)]
*  words, they will do it because Kamala is such a disaster. Now, I ended up not being right, although, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=828.64s)]
*  as I like to point out, it was very, very close. They would have pushed Joe out and they could have [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=834.96s)]
*  pushed Joe out with these stories, but they recognized that Kamala was a uniquely untalented [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=841.2s)]
*  and incapable politician. They made a calculated decision. The thing that the only shock here to [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=845.9200000000001s)]
*  me, by the way, I think they would have gotten Biden through the election if they had just said [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=852.24s)]
*  what I told them they should say all along, which is we will not platform an insurrectionist and an [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=856.16s)]
*  election denier in Donald Trump. They would have been able to do it. And here's the craziest thing [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=861.2s)]
*  of all, Megan, had they refused to debate, they would have at least gotten him to election day. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=866.48s)]
*  And I think it would have been closer than it was against Kamala. I really do. I think the whole [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=873.04s)]
*  Kamala debacle. Yeah. I totally agree with you. Now, wait, do you want a shock? You said that [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=877.76s)]
*  that was your only shock. I'm going to give you another shock. Ready for this? Oh, shock. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=883.8399999999999s)]
*  Guess who's coming on this show on Tuesday? Joe Biden. No, that really would be amazing. [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=887.12s)]
*  I was like, that would be amazing. He'd be amazing. Meghan Markle would be amazing. No, [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=897.52s)]
*  Jake Tapper and Alex Thompson. I mean, look, Jake said, I'll tell you this, and I know you guys are [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=903.2s)]
*  friends. Jake and I are not friends. He wants to come on our show. He's going to get lit up if he [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=909.7600000000001s)]
*  does, because there's no way for him to tell this story in a way other than why didn't you go on? [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=915.36s)]
*  I have rants on air for three years, three years talking about how Joe Biden clearly has the signs [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=920.32s)]
*  of dementia, clearly is too old for this. And it's not even like on the Turn on Ben Shapiro show, [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=927.52s)]
*  Dan Bongino was talking about. Turn on everybody in this space. You were talking, everybody knew. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=935.52s)]
*  We did a whole episode on it in June of 2022, a whole episode. I mean, it's rare for us to devote [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=941.12s)]
*  an entire episode to something like this. No, but you assume too little of your humble correspondent, [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=946.4s)]
*  because I am going to ask all the tough questions of both of them, and they know that. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=951.6s)]
*  I'm not saying I'm going to ask questions. I'm just minding my tongue, because I think that the [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=956.24s)]
*  whole thing is kind of an outrage and an insult to intelligence for all of us that they're now [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=962.5600000000001s)]
*  writing this book. And it's like, huh, yeah, turns out they were hiding from his aides that he had [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=967.12s)]
*  senility. This was the whole thing. They had a puppet president for four years. Megan, they were [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=971.6s)]
*  lecturing us about our sacred democracy. And I mean, you go back and see those, look at their [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=979.2s)]
*  reportage, look at whether it's Jake and Alex or others, look at what they were reporting on [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=984.16s)]
*  with Donald Trump and the insurrection and everything else. The guy who had the nuclear codes [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=989.28s)]
*  had a non-functioning brain. And we all know that, and they had it for years. They let him finish [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=994.24s)]
*  out the presidency. Why not the 25th Amendment? We heard about the 25th Amendment endlessly. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1000.24s)]
*  Donald Trump is sharp as a tack. Actually, that phrase now we can never use again, by the way, [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1006.0s)]
*  because of Joe Biden. Now it's become like a laugh line. But Donald Trump, last time I saw him, [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1010.08s)]
*  he comes off of 18 holes. He's like high-fiving Clay. He's hugging my wife. He's telling funny [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1014.48s)]
*  stories. Never once has someone said, oh, wow, I saw Donald Trump and it looked like he needed [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1020.8000000000001s)]
*  a sippy cup at nap time, because he doesn't, because his brain is fine, because he's different [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1026.08s)]
*  than Joe Biden. This whole story of, because I can see this now too, look, we were misled by the [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1030.32s)]
*  we were misled by the big bad Biden White House people. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1037.3600000000001s)]
*  Well, then you're a moron. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1040.96s)]
*  Just like the New York Times said. Like the New York Times said about COVID, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1041.7600000000002s)]
*  we were misled. No, we actively misled you. That's your proper headline, New York Times. [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1045.44s)]
*  Yes. These media people after the fact, now that we all on the right have been proven correct [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1050.96s)]
*  yet again, now I wanna glom onto our correctness. Like, oh, we saw two. We were part of the right [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1055.7600000000002s)]
*  narrative all along. No, you weren't. We were there. You were on the other side. We documented it. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1060.72s)]
*  Welcome to the party, Johnny come latelys, but you are very, very late. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1066.0800000000002s)]
*  Oh, and by the way, complicit, late and complicit. I mean, this is like we've got the two guys from [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1070.72s)]
*  the bank heist in two different rooms and they're both saying, he made me do it, the media and the [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1076.16s)]
*  Biden White House. It was all, and we all know too, they changed their directive for what they, [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1081.3600000000001s)]
*  there's a reason CNN in specifically is a giant dumpster fire. It has no credibility anymore [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1087.76s)]
*  because Jeff Zucker allowed it to turn itself into, and it's not just him, but there, you know, [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1095.68s)]
*  that was a big part of it, into an anti-Trump battleship. And guess what happens? If you lose, [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1099.92s)]
*  your battleship gets sunk. And that's where CNN is. No one should believe that this is an honest [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1106.8799999999999s)]
*  network that's trying to provide facts to the public. That's an absurdity. They let a president [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1111.44s)]
*  with dementia go unchallenged for years. In fact, the only, I'm sure you'll play it, the only clip [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1116.48s)]
*  of Tapper that anyone's seen about this is him actually challenging Laura Trump when she brings [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1122.48s)]
*  up Biden's cognitive clonies. Like, how dare you? Are you a psychiatrist? No, Jake, we're not all [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1128.08s)]
*  morons. We can see and hear and have for years that this guy is a puppet and the people around him are [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1132.88s)]
*  all playing a game. This is a, Megan, this is a sea change moment in the public's understanding [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1141.76s)]
*  of journalism, of the media, of who is honest, and we should not let this go. By the way, [[00:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1148.0s)]
*  I totally agree with you on COVID too. It's the same thing. They went from being the little, [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1153.04s)]
*  like, commissars of COVID enforcement in the media to, oh, but Big Bad Fauci told me that [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1158.24s)]
*  this was true. Somehow I was not fooled by any of that. Somehow I knew that all this was crap and [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1164.0s)]
*  that it came from a lab, that masks are a joke and that lockdowns are moronic. But I'm supposed to, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1169.36s)]
*  why is it that these people, I went on Bill Marsh's show back in October and I appreciate some of [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1175.76s)]
*  Bill's more recent commentary on these subjects because I think at some level he really just, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1180.56s)]
*  he just realized that the Democrat party's just gone insane. And he says that, right? [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1186.32s)]
*  No, but he thinks the Republicans are worse. You know that. [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1190.08s)]
*  Oh, absolutely. No, I always say this. He's right on about 40% of things these days. I'd say about [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1192.8s)]
*  40% he gets it, about 60% he's still living. He's not woke. And so on any woke issue, he's correct. [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1198.88s)]
*  But he definitely suffers from TDS. I mean, I like that he's got the TDS. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1204.48s)]
*  This is the one moment where we really had a sort of at cross purposes or at, just, I said, you know, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1210.0800000000002s)]
*  he's really not a fascist, Bill, right? Like it's going to be fine. He goes, no, I don't know that. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1214.8000000000002s)]
*  I was like, dude, come on, get, you know, you're a smart guy. You're, get a grip. Anyway, but I [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1218.8000000000002s)]
*  remember when I went on that show, we're talking about this. It was still considered some kind of [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1224.8s)]
*  right-wing talking point to say that the Democrats had tried to essentially swindle the American [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1229.52s)]
*  people by leaving Joe Biden in as long as they did. And the thing is, everyone can kind of figure [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1237.6s)]
*  this out. You leave Joe Biden in and then, oh my gosh, he debated. Now we can't continue the lie [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1243.84s)]
*  anymore. You go with Kamala. Why didn't they put Kamala in before? Because they knew that she was [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1249.44s)]
*  a disaster. She was a train wreck without dementia. It all played out exactly as it should have under [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1254.64s)]
*  the circumstances. And this is just for me now to look back on this. Here's the thing. Does anyone [[00:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1261.44s)]
*  say I'm sorry to their audience? Does anyone ever go and say, you know, hey. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1268.4s)]
*  Oh, look at Rachel Maddow after Russiagate fell apart. Did she come out and say, I got it completely [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1273.6000000000001s)]
*  wrong. I misled you for two years. No, she just rode that into a $30 million a year contract [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1279.68s)]
*  for one day a week and she's still the leftist goddess and revered for her factual, [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1286.3200000000002s)]
*  fact-based reporting. So I agree with you. I would add to this though, that in the case of Maddow, [[00:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1293.28s)]
*  the Russia collusion thing, while not entirely successful for the left, it slowed him down in [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1299.52s)]
*  the first administration. It was like an obstruction tactic. So the fact that they were [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1306.88s)]
*  lying about that to their audience, I'm talking about if you're an MSNBC watcher, it's tell me [[00:21:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1312.64s)]
*  more about Russia. Talk about how Trump and Putin were like, you know, taking Turkish baths together. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1318.4s)]
*  Like make up whatever you want. As long as it's hurting Trump, I'm in, you know. The problem they [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1322.96s)]
*  have in this case, in this story, is Joe Biden's fine. They're lying to you. He doesn't have [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1328.4s)]
*  dementia. Joe Biden's fine. Oh, Hitler just won the election. And now we're going to tell you that [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1334.48s)]
*  we were lying to you about the dementia the whole time. They have made a mockery of their own [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1340.96s)]
*  audience and they failed. Do you see what I mean? Like that's the, there was no upside to this. This [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1346.0s)]
*  was a catastrophe politically for them. They're fine with lying, but if you lie and you lose, [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1351.44s)]
*  now people who watch Maddow at home, well, that's a whole other kind of like who's watching Maddow [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1357.04s)]
*  at home, but people who are watching these individuals, yeah, they need to have a reckoning. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1361.6s)]
*  The reckoning needs to happen and I don't know if it will. There are real consequences to those [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1368.24s)]
*  lies. Well, I'm shocked. I have to say that it's like, I guess I'm not shocked. I mean, I'm not [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1372.8799999999999s)]
*  shocked. He was about to go into a wheelchair. He looked like he was about to go into a casket. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1379.04s)]
*  That's the truth. But it is interesting to read these people coming out with the progressive levels [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1382.32s)]
*  of how bad it was. And I, you know, the more I read, the more I just think what I've been thinking, [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1388.32s)]
*  which is F these people, they should never be trusted again. There needs to be a federal [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1393.52s)]
*  investigation into how bad he was, whether he was competent while in the office and making the [[00:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1398.24s)]
*  decisions and signing the executive orders and the pardons, who was making the calls. We still [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1405.04s)]
*  don't know. We need subpoena power over his top aides who need to be forced under oath to tell us [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1412.32s)]
*  who was governing the country. That hasn't happened so far and it needs to. Okay. I want to keep going [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1419.6s)]
*  because we don't have that much time. Can I just say one quick thing? It's just that I think Jill [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1424.8s)]
*  Biden is going to emerge as one of the quick, it was one of the big villains in all this. Jill Biden [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1427.84s)]
*  should have pulled her husband out of this. Anyway, she's a doctor. She should know better. [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1431.4399999999998s)]
*  Okay. Let's talk about, I know you're big on this subject and I find it fascinating too. [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1437.84s)]
*  Trump is going to bring, is bringing white Afrikaners from South Africa to the United States [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1441.6s)]
*  as refugees. We've had some, what's the number like 59 arrive in the past day. And this is because [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1447.76s)]
*  in South Africa now they have turned on white people and decided that because of the history of [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1456.08s)]
*  villainous behavior there, that the current whites in South Africa must be punished, [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1463.28s)]
*  up to and including taking their land away from them and just giving it to black South African [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1468.6399999999999s)]
*  residents and citizens. So now Trump has said they can come here. There's some 8,000 of them [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1477.6s)]
*  who want to leave. And so he's not saying yes to everybody, but he's saying, we're going to take a [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1482.8s)]
*  look. They can come here. This is what a true refugee looks like who is under threat because [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1486.8s)]
*  of his race of losing his property, his livelihood and potentially worse. I mean, [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1492.4s)]
*  claims of violence and threatened death. And the first shipment of folks arrived yesterday [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1497.8400000000001s)]
*  and there they were literally standing there waving American flags. Look at this. Look, [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1504.24s)]
*  I mean, I'm sorry, but like they look like people who would like to assimilate. I'm very encouraged [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1511.68s)]
*  by their American flag shirts, their American flags that they're holding and waving and [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1516.16s)]
*  full of gratitude to president Trump and to this country for giving them a place to go after being [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1521.92s)]
*  persecuted for no reason other than the color of their skin. But now Buck, we've got the left [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1527.6s)]
*  saying, this has gone too fast. They're allowing in these refugees too quickly without adequate [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1535.68s)]
*  investigation of who they are and whether they deserve to be here. We should have involved the [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1543.36s)]
*  UN say some of these Democrats and the hypocrisy is dripping, dripping from the sides of their [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1548.48s)]
*  mouths as they make these claims. Your thoughts on it? Well, first of all, it's just beyond parody [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1555.68s)]
*  that for four years of the Biden administration, you had 10 plus million illegals piling into the [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1561.44s)]
*  country, overwhelmingly claiming false asylum, right? I mean, these are people who there is [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1568.56s)]
*  absolutely no basis to believe that they really need asylum. They just come from generally poor, [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1574.96s)]
*  crappy countries, just the way it is. And they'd rather be in America, especially in America that [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1580.48s)]
*  gives them $400 a night hotel rooms in Midtown Manhattan and gives them culturally sensitive [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1584.8000000000002s)]
*  meals and preloaded debit cards, right? That sounds better than wherever they come from. [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1589.44s)]
*  10 plus million and this is, oh, but we're a nation of immigrants. We're not a nation of illegal [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1596.0800000000002s)]
*  immigrants, by the way, but that's a whole other part of the conversation. Now we have 50 people [[00:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1601.68s)]
*  who come to this country legally, lawfully at the invitation of the executive branch of the [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1606.16s)]
*  president himself. And the media is completely freaked out. These are people who bring skills [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1612.16s)]
*  with them, particularly if they're Afrikaners who have a farming background, I mean, a high level [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1616.16s)]
*  farming background. That means that they would be productive right away. And also people that [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1621.04s)]
*  speak English and love this place. They're not coming here because we're a giant welfare [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1626.72s)]
*  welfare camp or a soup kitchen. They're coming here because they love this place. I'm just going to [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1631.52s)]
*  say this. I live in South Florida. Cuban Americans are some of the most patriotic Americans you'll [[00:27:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1635.52s)]
*  ever see in your life. People that fled the Khmer Rouge and Pol Pot in Cambodia. They love this [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1640.08s)]
*  country. Former Soviets. You get what I'm saying. People that have fled injustice and tyranny and [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1644.72s)]
*  come here lawfully love this place. Millions of people scam the system under Biden. These people [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1650.16s)]
*  are actually coming here the right way. Here's why it's such a problem for the Democrats. And [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1655.84s)]
*  I mean, I've been talking about this issue for years because what you really have in South Africa [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1660.56s)]
*  is an end state, an end state affirmative action country, if you will, where instead of just being [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1665.9199999999998s)]
*  this amorphous, which the Supreme Court just of course shut down, but this amorphous like, well, [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1674.1599999999999s)]
*  we need to take these things into account. You have explicit quotas in South Africa. You have, [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1678.8s)]
*  you must have, I think 85% of your company must be black employees or must the managerial set must [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1684.0s)]
*  be black. If you want to get certain loans, you have to actually be black or at least partner with [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1692.48s)]
*  somebody who is black. There's all of these rules and laws that explicitly disenfranchise the roughly [[00:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1697.52s)]
*  7% of South Africa that is white. And that's predominantly Afrikaner. I mean, they can get a [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1703.44s)]
*  Dutch East India Company comes around 1653. There are Dutch and Germans who are there. And then the [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1710.48s)]
*  English end up taking it over later for, but point being the 7% of the country that is, that is, [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1715.28s)]
*  that is white has not only state sponsored disenfranchisement going on now, but there's [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1721.3600000000001s)]
*  also an unwillingness to, to police and protect particularly these farms that have been the [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1727.52s)]
*  subjects of clearly anti-white violence of the most gruesome and horrific kind. And if you look [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1734.8s)]
*  next door to what happened in Zimbabwe, formerly Rhodesia with Mugabe, who died some years back, [[00:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1740.8799999999999s)]
*  but he was the dictator there, they had a land expropriation campaign. There's talk of that [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1747.9199999999998s)]
*  happening now in South Africa fully. It has not happened. And I believe it's come up in the [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1753.44s)]
*  legislature, but they say, you know what? The land belongs to the black people in this country, [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1757.12s)]
*  not the white people. That was what happened in Zimbabwe. It went from being the bread basket of [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1761.52s)]
*  Africa to being a place that cannot, cannot feed itself as a country and has inflation rates in [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1765.2s)]
*  the trillions of dollars. I mean, you can't even, you know, no one can conceive of the numbers of [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1771.2s)]
*  inflation that happened in Zimbabwe. Basically destroyed the country. And there's talk of doing [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1775.12s)]
*  that in South Africa. There's also rolling blackouts in the country. There's corruption [[00:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1780.0s)]
*  that would make what happens in some parts of Latin America look like it was Switzerland. The [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1784.8799999999999s)]
*  place is a mess and there's still tremendous blame and resentment on the white. I even saw it on the [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1789.36s)]
*  MSNBC panel. This is what I do with my mornings this, you know, earlier today where there's [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1796.08s)]
*  tremendous blame for the white people who live there. Like some of them are, you know, they're, [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1800.56s)]
*  they were born after apartheid ended. Like why are they being punished for this? And what, [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1804.8799999999999s)]
*  what it really goes to Megan is they cannot, the Democrat leftist mind cannot conceive of a situation [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1811.04s)]
*  in which there is discrimination against white people. They believe racism is an ailment specific [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1818.96s)]
*  to white people and it is impossible for non-whites to be racist. And so this just, this is an absolute [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1825.28s)]
*  circuitry breakdown for them mentally. They can't process and handle this and it completely freaks [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1832.72s)]
*  them out. It's really good for the American people to see, oh, so that's what the game is here. [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1837.44s)]
*  You're so right. That's exactly right. Well said. Here's another example of exactly what [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1842.8s)]
*  you're talking about. Her name is Ashley Allison. We've shown the audience this woman before. She [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1848.08s)]
*  goes on this CNN panel on the Abby Phillips show that Scott Jennings appears on. And she was the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1852.96s)]
*  former national coalitions director for Biden Harris 2020. This is the woman who was out there [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1859.4399999999998s)]
*  not long ago saying black women are the most educated people in the world and I still can't [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1865.4399999999998s)]
*  get ahead. I don't understand. Like I've still been left behind even at CNN when I should have [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1873.04s)]
*  jumped ahead of others alleging, I guess that CNN is a bunch of racist sexist pigs, but in any event, [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1877.28s)]
*  or I guess it was Obama. She was saying like under Obama, she didn't get ahead. Notwithstanding [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1883.6s)]
*  the fact she was clearly the most qualified woman in the room because she's a black woman with all [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1888.16s)]
*  this education. Okay. Well, maybe you're not that impressive. Maybe you didn't wow people. I hate [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1891.76s)]
*  to break it to you. You don't seem that impressive to me. I watch you on CNN and these clips. I'm [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1896.56s)]
*  never like, wow, this is a really intelligent, thoughtful person. And it seems like Obama's [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1900.48s)]
*  administration felt the same. Well, she's back with thoughts on this South African situation. Watch this [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1904.8799999999999s)]
*  35, 30 plus years ago, they went through a revolution. The apartheid system ended [[00:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1911.2s)]
*  and they reformed their constitution under the great leader of Nelson Mandela. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1919.12s)]
*  And that allowed for a racial reconciliation, one that this country has yet to do. But South [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1923.68s)]
*  Africa did it and they reformed their constitution. And part of that is that the people who are native [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1930.24s)]
*  to that land deserve their rightful land back. The constitution in South Africa is discriminatory. [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1935.04s)]
*  They have their checks and balances in that land, just like we do. And that is for them to, so if [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1940.88s)]
*  the Afrikaners don't actually like the land, they can leave that country. They are, they're leaving [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1946.08s)]
*  to come here. No, they can actually leave and go to where their native land is, which is probably [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1951.1200000000001s)]
*  Germany. Are you against them coming here? Holland. Are you against them coming here? [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1957.28s)]
*  I'm against the hypocrisy of this administration. No, no, that's not the question. The question I am against [[00:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1961.68s)]
*  is that they are being given special treatment when there is not a genocide happening in South [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1966.08s)]
*  Africa and they just don't like the law of the land. Amazing. Amazing. Is there a genocide [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1969.92s)]
*  happening right now in Venezuela or Mexico? Because you really seem to love the immigrants [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=1977.36s)]

*  fantastic work. And second of all on this, if you come to this country illegally from Haiti or from [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2011.68s)]
*  Ghana or from Bangladesh or wherever, the Democrats believe that you're as American as American can be [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2019.2s)]

*  the language. Who cares? You don't know anything about this country. What's the difference? You're [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2030.8s)]

*  You should be open arms because there's a lot of reasons for this, but one of them is because of [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2043.36s)]
*  America's history of exploitation, colonialism and slavery. So whatever we have to do to help the [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2048.3199999999997s)]

*  should go back to where they came from. They've been for 300 years in South Africa. 300 years. [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2065.36s)]
*  I hate to break this to people. This is part of the massive ignorance of history that exists on [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2074.88s)]
*  the left. Even the people that are supposed to, like the people that are involved in writing [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2079.52s)]
*  the 1619 project and people that you see- She's one of the highest educated though, Buck. She's [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2082.88s)]
*  one of the highest educated. They don't know anything about history. They know about propaganda [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2086.7200000000003s)]
*  and how to tell people that they're not accountable for their own decisions. They're [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2093.2s)]
*  not accountable for what's going on today. It's all about historical wrongs. I see this and I see [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2096.56s)]
*  people who somehow have set up a double standard in their mind whereby it doesn't matter that South [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2102.72s)]
*  Africa is openly discriminating against people based upon skin color because of what happened [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2109.68s)]
*  a long time ago. And I sit here and I say, hold on a second. I mean, the Dutch have been there for [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2116.0s)]
*  hundreds of years. The Zulu tribe, for example, which people say, well, I saw someone on Twitter [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2119.52s)]
*  like, why don't the Dutch learn how to already, you know, the Afrikaners learn how to speak Zulu. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2124.72s)]
*  They came like 150 years after the Dutch arrived there. They were conquerors from neighboring [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2128.4s)]
*  tribes who showed up. It wasn't like the Dutch and the English took over some shangri-la here. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2134.96s)]
*  It was like a well-functioning Jeffersonian democracy. It was a largely uninhabited piece [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2141.7599999999998s)]
*  of land. And at what point do you get to say that this is actually your homeland too? Again, [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2148.16s)]
*  if you come here and you're not white and you illegally arrive here, it is, Megan, if you're an [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2153.44s)]
*  MS-13 gang member who's not supposed to be here as American as you and me and everybody listening, [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2158.7999999999997s)]
*  how dare you not give him like seven different court hearings or whatever. But the guys who have [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2165.12s)]
*  been living in South Africa, their generations, their families go back for six, seven, eight [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2169.6s)]
*  generations now, hundreds of years. They're supposed to go back to Germany. And by the way, [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2173.84s)]
*  why is that not a racist comment that she says on that show on CNN? Go back to where you came from. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2178.48s)]
*  Megan Rundell Yeah, no kidding. And why does she have such a strong objection to them coming here? [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2183.6000000000004s)]
*  No, not here. No. She says, and they should leave. And then Scott Jennings says they are. And she was [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2187.52s)]
*  like, no, not here. Go back to Germany or go to Holland. Like, what is it about them, Ashley, [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2194.0s)]
*  that you find so objectionable? You know, when when normal law abiding Americans, including [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2201.2799999999997s)]
*  overwhelmingly Hispanics, objected to the waves of illegals coming in mostly from South America, [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2207.2799999999997s)]
*  Latin America, you call them all racists. You said we all these that the left said, it's all about [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2214.64s)]
*  racism. You hate brown people. But now this one small group of whites who actually are facing [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2220.64s)]
*  massive racial discrimination comes and she says it's a no get out. Why? It's obviously because of [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2226.4s)]
*  skin color. And by the way, live by the sword, die by the sword. We'll play by your rules. [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2232.48s)]
*  Scott Jennings Oh, absolutely. And what you see here is that the the left believes in [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2236.32s)]
*  intersectionality. They don't use the term very much anymore because it sounds too nerdy. But [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2242.4s)]
*  intersectionality is just different groups. If you will, you know, racial groups in particular, [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2246.64s)]
*  but different groups within society are all constantly vying for dominance and power over [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2252.32s)]
*  each other. And that it's the role of the state to play this kind of arbiter that says, well, no, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2257.76s)]
*  you need to be suppressed and you need to be elevated. This is antithetical to the most core [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2262.4s)]
*  American values and principles. This is antithetical to what we fought a very bloody civil war over and [[00:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2268.2400000000002s)]
*  had to have constitutional amendments to clarify, which is that all men are created equal and we're [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2274.88s)]
*  all be treated equally under the law. South Africa is failing that. And we all know it openly. [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2279.68s)]
*  And what you see in South Africa is the problem. You know, the problems of the past are going to [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2285.44s)]
*  continuously be addressed into the future. And you're going to disenfranchise people in this case, [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2290.8799999999997s)]
*  the, you know, the Afrikaners because of what their grandfathers did or their great grandfathers [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2296.56s)]
*  did. And you're going to say that a legal regime that discriminates based upon historical narrative [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2301.2s)]
*  is just why? Well, because it's black people doing it to white people. And, you know, [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2307.36s)]
*  it's amazing when you look, you look at the reaction, you've got the New York Times literally [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2312.6400000000003s)]
*  saying this is going too fast. The refugee process often takes years, but only three months have passed [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2316.0s)]
*  from the time Trump signed this executive order. It's, it's happening too quickly. Time magazine. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2320.7200000000003s)]
*  Refugees coming into the U S are typically vetted by the United Nations, which routinely refers [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2325.1200000000003s)]
*  people fleeing persecution and violence in their home country to safer countries like the U S. [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2330.56s)]
*  The arrivals from South Africa were not vetted by that office. Suddenly they're so concerned [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2334.08s)]
*  about the vetting and the speed of the arrival of the refugees. Give me a break. All right, [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2339.2799999999997s)]
*  wait, there's a lot to get there. So I got to switch now to the UK where there's a similar [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2345.84s)]
*  switcheroo happening with Keir Starmer. Okay. Who was completely in favor of open borders, [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2349.92s)]
*  just like the rest of his left wing party. There are statements after statement after statement [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2357.36s)]
*  by him. I'll just give you a montage of a few of how he's been sounding in the prior years to this [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2362.4s)]
*  one. Listen. So we have to make the case for the benefits of migration, the benefits of free movement. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2368.1600000000003s)]
*  We have to make the case for freedom of movement and we have to make it strongly. We welcome [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2375.6s)]
*  migrants. We don't scapegoat them. Low wages, poor housing, poor public services are not the [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2383.36s)]
*  fault of migrants and people who've come here. They're political failure, political failure. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2390.96s)]
*  I think we should welcome people wherever they come from, thank them for their contribution and [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2396.56s)]
*  see them as part of our families, our communities and our society and embrace that. The labor party [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2400.8s)]
*  has been a bit scared of making the positive case for immigration for quite a number of years and [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2408.64s)]
*  I think we need to turn that around. Okay, great Keir. How'd that work out? I'll show you. Listen [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2412.48s)]
*  what he's saying now. Today we publish a white paper on immigration, a strategy absolutely central [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2418.88s)]
*  to my plan for change that will finally take back control of our borders and close the book [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2428.48s)]
*  on a squalid chapter for our politics, our economy and our country. The experiment is over. We risk [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2437.04s)]
*  becoming an island of strangers, not a nation that walks forward together but when people come to [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2444.88s)]
*  our country they should also commit to integration, to learning our language and our system can actively [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2451.84s)]
*  distinguish between those that do and those that don't. What an idiot. We've all been saying that [[00:41:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2460.4s)]
*  for decades and he and his party and their counterparts here in America have been challenging [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2470.32s)]
*  us saying those kinds of statements are racist. Now this asshole finally realizes that he's been [[00:41:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2476.48s)]
*  on the wrong side without doing a mea culpa, right? Just kind of comes out there like gee, [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2482.88s)]
*  now it's gotten really bad and by the way Buck, it has gotten terrible over there. In recent years [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2487.28s)]
*  the immigration numbers in the UK have illegal immigration have reached 906,000 in the year [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2494.0s)]
*  from June 2022 to June 2023. Back when David Cameron was prime minister in 2010, they were [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2503.68s)]
*  in a freak out about the fact that annual net immigration had exceeded 100,000. Now it's at [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2511.44s)]
*  900 plus thousand and finally after their country is gone, it's gone. The UK is no longer what it [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2520.3199999999997s)]
*  once was and I don't think it will ever be again. Finally Johnny come lately Keir Starmer is like, [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2529.12s)]
*  oh gee, they're not assimilating and we should do a crackdown. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2534.4799999999996s)]
*  Yeah, this was predictable and in fact you and I and many others predicted it for many years as [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2540.56s)]
*  you pointed out this was the most obvious thing in the world taking people in huge numbers who [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2545.28s)]
*  have, isn't it interesting Megan, you can finally say these things now and there's not this sense [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2550.96s)]

*  who share your language and your culture and people who are going to bring something to the [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2563.0400000000004s)]

*  Brits won't do. This is all bull crap and the numbers now show it. You look at Canada for [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=2606.72s)]

*  baby it was sean combs he claimed that he was working in import export business cassie and [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3778.16s)]
*  daniel had sex he was getting paid for the sex daniel was diddy watched and pleasured himself [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3785.28s)]
*  baby oil all over each other diddy complained not enough baby oil he was obsessed with the baby oil [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3789.84s)]
*  that diddy's daughters again this is per long crime left the room the courtroom when this [[01:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3795.28s)]
*  testimony is being given they didn't want to hear this about their father his son stayed [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3800.64s)]
*  that no sexual protection was used that cassie um messaged him after the fact for forgive me but [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3804.0s)]
*  a dick pic um that it happened multiple times over 2013 and 2014 he saw diddy physically abusing [[01:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3810.3199999999997s)]
*  cassie or at least heard him slapping her behind closed doors doors diddy um would direct the sex [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3816.4s)]
*  saying slow down you know finish off if you will here or there on her body cassie wanted him to [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3823.04s)]
*  urinate on on her and then i saw another report saying diddy instructed him to urinate [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3828.8s)]
*  in her mouth forgive me this is very tawdry stuff um and then diddy would be pleasuring himself to [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3834.96s)]
*  it that they wanted a copy of daniel's driver's license and therefore he felt threatened or [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3840.4s)]
*  like diddy could come back to hurt him that he urged cassie to leave diddy um saying that you [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3845.84s)]
*  know he's gonna hurt you this is uh i tried to explain to her she was in real danger if she [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3850.88s)]
*  stayed okay so that's this guy's testimony and the reason i'm going to ui gouache on this is that [[01:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3856.48s)]
*  the defense to this seems to be he was paying these sex workers like daniel and there'll be [[01:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3861.44s)]
*  others who claim that they were paid i think well there have been in this in the press we'll see [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3866.32s)]
*  whether they actually call him the that he was paying sex workers not for sex but for their and [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3870.8s)]
*  i quote time and experience time and experience um that it was not transportation to engage in [[01:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3877.76s)]
*  prostitution so much as i guess to gain their expertise as sex workers to like advise i guess [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3887.28s)]
*  on how it can be done in the most most filthy offensive ways possible thoughts on all that [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3896.0s)]
*  okay well if it's believed then that's a pretty good defense why would it be believed because [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3900.88s)]
*  it's bizarre enough like everything else they're gonna hear this is not reality as they would [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3906.0s)]
*  consider reality the reality that diddy is a completely different world so if his defense [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3912.48s)]
*  is a little off a little bizarre um yeah that would be fair and consistent most of the things [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3918.72s)]
*  you just read by the way are are things that that can be overcome by arguing consent everybody's [[01:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3925.28s)]
*  playing along not the prostitution not the prostitution mark not not that not transportation [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3931.84s)]
*  to engage in prostitution i'm not so sure about that megan because they're arguing consent megan [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3938.0s)]
*  yeah everybody's involved everybody's okay yeah what do you mean the hooker's always involved [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3943.36s)]
*  in okay with it she always consents yeah but the when you take a look at the statute and you [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3949.1200000000003s)]
*  interpret the statute what you're doing here is you're actually trying to turn it on its head [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3956.8s)]
*  it's designed for the so-called way i'm old enough to remember when you used to call this [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3962.0s)]
*  pimping and pandering the this is designed for the pimp it's not designed for the john and that's [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3968.0s)]
*  where they've turned it on its head that's why the elements don't make all that much sense [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3975.28s)]
*  when it's applied here and i think you're going to see that when you get the jury instructions [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3979.44s)]
*  i don't how is it not how is he not the pimp in this scenario where he's paying this guy daniel [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=3984.0s)]

*  way traditionally this has been applied this is a whole new you know special ditty exception if [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4031.52s)]

*  hiring sex workers over the course of years and in some cases transporting them to his location [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4047.2799999999997s)]

*  elements of it may not line up with those particular acts and i haven't looked at each element to see [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4134.400000000001s)]
*  whether that's true but i i'm aware that you cannot you cannot do by phone what you could not do in [[01:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4139.52s)]
*  person you're not allowed it's no more legal for the person to order the prostitute and pay him [[01:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4145.6s)]
*  than it is to be the prostitute and do it period okay um let's keep going because the uh there's [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4149.04s)]
*  a lot of other things to talk about let's do menendez next um because that's another one that's [[01:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4154.32s)]
*  another garagos case i can't keep up and not just garagos but my lawyer and friend brian freedman [[01:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4159.04s)]
*  is now involved in trying to get your two clients out of jail on any number of ways like it there's [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4164.96s)]
*  a there's a few different ways now where you might be able to get them out because what originally [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4174.16s)]
*  happened was the old the outgoing gascon attorney said you know what i'm gonna i want to take another [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4178.0s)]
*  look at whether um these guys should be held like maybe we need to take a fresh look at this case [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4184.0s)]
*  and it was clearly a ploy to stay in office well he got booted and and now the new da is like [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4190.16s)]
*  never mind we don't want to do that and you guys first said this new da should recuse himself he [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4195.12s)]
*  shouldn't be part of this case and i think that's where all hell broke loose mark garagos what [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4202.64s)]
*  happened now do you now do you want him this guy hokman do you want him gone or don't you because [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4209.92s)]
*  it seems like you then backed off of your motion to have him booted from the case so and i said [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4214.88s)]
*  this on the record brian your lawyer my friend um had discovered uh right before court last week [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4220.4800000000005s)]
*  somebody had come up with because we both been kind of perplexed by the idea of why is this guy [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4230.08s)]
*  so personally invested in this case and uh meaning nathan hokman as it turns out brian had discovered [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4236.64s)]
*  that he had engaged a uh crisis management firm that arguably had been doing a social media [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4245.280000000001s)]
*  campaign against the brothers and then i said well if that's true and i said this on the record to [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4253.360000000001s)]
*  the judge i then did some googling and it turns out that mr hokman when he was in private practice [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4258.96s)]
*  he and his father who were very accomplished tax defense lawyers in los angeles had represented [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4265.52s)]
*  jose's ex business partner in a tax dispute regarding a transaction that took place months [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4273.44s)]
*  after jose was killed and so this whole kind of jose rehab tour that reputation rehab tour that [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4281.76s)]
*  hokman has been on all of a sudden comes into focus they say well why didn't we pursue that [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4290.320000000001s)]
*  i want and as we're taping this megan i'm about to cut you off and and say goodbye to my friend [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4295.76s)]
*  mark because i've got to get to court i don't want to delay the resentencing and i want to get in there [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4302.24s)]
*  i want the judge to hear the evidence i want the judge to engage with the victims because by the [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4306.96s)]
*  way brian represents all of the victims and every living victim is uniformly shoulder to shoulder [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4312.88s)]
*  yeah of jose jose's older sister all of jose's relatives of kitty menendez her older sister all [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4321.92s)]
*  of their relatives everybody wants them out everybody says they have rehabilitated everybody [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4330.08s)]
*  who has in that family who understands what this statute is and what a resentencing is [[01:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4335.84s)]
*  all are uniformly in lockstep with us they want them out but let me ask you okay so as i understand [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4342.96s)]
*  it there are three yeah let me just ask this first there are three possibilities to get them out one [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4349.76s)]
*  that they're just resentenced that's what george gaskin initiated last fall the second is clemency [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4354.56s)]
*  from governor from governor gavin newsome gavinor gavinor newsom and the third is [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4362.4s)]
*  habeas corpus petition filed by you guys claiming that there's new evidence unearthed about the [[01:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4370.639999999999s)]
*  sexual abuse by jose menendez and we've discussed some of that in the past like the minuto singer [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4377.679999999999s)]
*  who said he he molested me and so on so which one is the is your best path here mark which one is the [[01:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4384.639999999999s)]
*  most active and most likely to get him out today today as we're taping this would i go to court [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4390.48s)]
*  which is the resentencing thing started by gaskin correct correct and i mean i go ahead all right [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4396.5599999999995s)]
*  garish so i wanted to ask mark and i say i say this with love and friendship um those who have [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4401.2s)]
*  challenges with them getting out primarily point to their mother and you know why did she need to [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4407.28s)]
*  be killed and that just complicates the whole thing and i'm wondering what your response is [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4414.639999999999s)]
*  my response is is that the focus of the statute is the 35 years since the crime [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4419.84s)]
*  and one of the things that i've been so frustrated by is the current da's conflation of that issue [[01:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4427.84s)]
*  that mark talks about with what the statute says the statute says basically minimizes looking at [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4434.8s)]
*  the crime and maximizes what have you done since then now to answer your question more fundamentally [[01:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4442.24s)]
*  or on the merits i far be it for me to be the one who kind of seizes the moral high ground on kitty [[01:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4449.04s)]
*  i have sat numerous times i put her under oath in this courtroom in november and i put her under [[01:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4456.64s)]
*  oath a year but more than a year ago to what's called a conditional exam with jone her older [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4462.24s)]
*  sister who describes herself look i was not only kitty's older sister i was eight years older than [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4468.64s)]
*  her and i kind of was a surrogate mother to her as to kitty as well i loved her more than you can [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4474.64s)]
*  love your own child and i have forgiven them and i want them out before i die that is one of my [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4480.72s)]
*  fondest wishes in this case is to get them out so they can get out so they can hug jone so i can [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4489.360000000001s)]
*  get into a detailed explanation as to all of the facts of the crime we don't have enough time but [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4496.0s)]
*  i will tell you far be it for me to put myself in shoes other than where kitty's old sister has said [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4502.72s)]
*  please please judge let them out okay there's a lot more to get to i want to do quickly a fast one [[01:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4510.8s)]
*  which is the blake lively justin baldoni case which is being handled for baldoni by our friend [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4518.240000000001s)]
*  brian friedman and he has just dropped a subpoena on taylor swift saying she needs to participate [[01:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4523.92s)]
*  in this trial because she was alleged to have been at this meeting at blake lively and just [[01:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4532.72s)]
*  blake lively and ryan reynolds new york city penthouse where they discussed a scene that blake [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4544.56s)]
*  had rewritten justin has said that the meeting got very heated and that he felt ambushed because [[01:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4551.04s)]
*  blake's husband ryan reynolds was there and then taylor swift showed up not to mention blake also [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4556.56s)]
*  sent justin a text message claiming taylor swift was her dragon and she blake lively was calici [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4564.0s)]
*  and so to me i'm not surprised at all i mean i'm i'm biased towards brian i admit but i actually [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4571.5199999999995s)]
*  don't find this surprising at all i think most lawyers would subpoena a witness to this critical [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4577.84s)]
*  meeting and the fact that she's taylor swift doesn't allow her to be treated any differently [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4583.2s)]
*  from somebody who is named barbara or taylor i guess uh taylor smith instead of taylor swift [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4589.36s)]
*  i'll start with you on that garagos well look i readily concede as you do brian is probably one [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4598.08s)]
*  of my closest friends in the world uh having said that and it seems like every case we have [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4605.04s)]
*  this time there's some connection but the yeah that when somebody says and i saw this yesterday [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4610.56s)]
*  i don't know if it was taylor or her people saying we just licensed the song 19 other people have [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4618.0s)]
*  licensed the song well excuse me if you're the movie yeah to the movie if you're a percipient [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4624.08s)]
*  witness to a meeting that is essential to the allegations in the case i understand that it's [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4630.72s)]
*  a pain in the ass i understand that you don't want to be involved that you want to get dragged into [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4637.280000000001s)]
*  it but the fact is you're a percipient witness and that's what litigation is all about do they [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4642.0s)]
*  care iglarsh that it's one of the biggest stars in the world will the judge factor that in when [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4648.4800000000005s)]
*  deciding whether or not she should be forced to testify in this case it shouldn't matter if she's [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4653.52s)]
*  a key witness and has relevant information then there's no way that she doesn't have to testify [[01:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4659.28s)]
*  and get involved so when do we know when that trial is mark garagos no we don't um and [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4665.04s)]
*  probably if i had to bet brian probably will slap me when i go see him in about an hour [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4673.44s)]
*  i don't think this will ever get to trial they can't they can't afford to have this go to trial [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4679.92s)]
*  i know who they they meaning the other side blake lively ryan reddells cannot afford to and not not [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4686.08s)]
*  financially afford they cannot they cannot weather the collateral damage that will be done at a trial [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4696.32s)]
*  it's already being done it's already i was going to say it's already been i don't know i mean you [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4702.96s)]
*  can manage your way i suppose out of anything from a crisis management standpoint but the amount of [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4708.72s)]
*  self-inflicted damage in this case so much on their side um not just laying it at brian's feet [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4714.88s)]
*  kind of their tone death responses to things has just been astonishing to me so but well how does [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4722.0s)]
*  it end then because she's suing justin justin's suing the new york times and has he also brought [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4728.400000000001s)]
*  a counterclaim against her i'm trying to remember the specifics he's definitely the new york times [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4735.4400000000005s)]
*  i believe so at some point everybody's going to get into a room there's going to be a retired [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4741.6s)]
*  judge as a mediator and he's going to sit there he's going to do shuttle diplomacy and it's going [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4747.12s)]
*  to end the way that almost all uh disputes in hollywood end which is a mediated uh settlement [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4752.0s)]
*  let me tell you a story about brian friedman they can't they have to resolve this i've told [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4759.2s)]
*  the audiences before but i met brian friedman when he was suing me he was suing me he wasn't [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4764.4800000000005s)]
*  the plaintiff but he was the lawyer for somebody who was suing me it was a dispute i had with a [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4769.36s)]
*  former agent and um he took my deposition at the beginning i was like i can't stand this guy i want [[01:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4773.679999999999s)]
*  to punch him in the face and by the end of that deposition i was like i'm in love with him i need [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4780.48s)]
*  to know him on a personal level he's like one of my favorite people ever and a beautiful friendship [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4784.639999999999s)]
*  was born but when he was still adverse to me we had a mediation and to try to settle whenever [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4788.719999999999s)]
*  you're like on the way toward litigation usually do a mediation and then ultimately you either have [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4796.16s)]
*  an arbitration or trial so we entered the mediation and he showed up he flew all the way in from [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4800.5599999999995s)]
*  california he flew all the way in we talked to this retired judge like all right this is whatever [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4804.72s)]
*  i said what i thought and then he went over to talk to brian friedman who represented the other [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4809.68s)]
*  side he came back to us within 30 seconds and like they hadn't moved at all like nothing not even a [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4814.08s)]
*  good faith you know movement which is you know we both thought we were totally right and uh [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4819.84s)]
*  i'm like well what did he say and he goes uh you know basically telling us to pound sand and i'm [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4825.200000000001s)]
*  like well what what did you say and the mediator had said to him like what are you doing here then [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4831.52s)]

*  um 22 that he went right the the allegation that brian kohlberger went went to this house that he [[01:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4927.04s)]
*  was casing the house that he went by the house multiple times that night including multiple [[01:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4933.76s)]
*  times in the 3 a.m hour the murders happened in the 4 a.m hour between like 406 and 419 a.m [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4938.32s)]
*  that he went in through the sliding door of the second floor which we know which is sort of the [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4944.08s)]
*  ground floor that he went right upstairs that the main target was not kaylee gonzalves which is what [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4948.0s)]
*  some of us previously believed and had been told but was maddie mogan who was in bed with [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4955.28s)]
*  kaylee their best friends and sleeping in the same bed that it was maddie mogan that um [[01:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4960.08s)]
*  unfortunately kaylee who was there visiting was collateral damage in the moment that he killed [[01:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4965.599999999999s)]
*  the two of them and that they believe that he then was spotted by zanna kernodal who was down one [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4972.4s)]
*  floor as he was leaving that he went to kill her did kill her in the hallway that they fought that [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4980.48s)]
*  there was she fought for her life that then ethan chapein was asleep and either slept through this [[01:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4988.16s)]
*  it was unclear to me exactly what the sequence was but he then murdered ethan chapein with his [[01:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=4994.879999999999s)]
*  knife and quote carved and they make a point in the dateline show of saying it was a carving [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5000.639999999999s)]
*  this young man's legs which is just beyond sick then went to leave bumped into the one surviving [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5006.72s)]
*  roommate and she heard him say something effective don't worry you'll be okay and she just froze he [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5014.08s)]
*  left and immediately she and the other surviving roommate who was down the hall or on a different [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5023.04s)]
*  floor started texting they knew immediately something terrible had happened it was apparent [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5028.16s)]
*  to those two roommates who lived like that they texted for the next couple of hours and then the [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5032.8s)]
*  texting resumed a very strange sequence of events there but also pointing out that he had all these [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5038.64s)]
*  like bikini shots of girls around his campus and the idaho campus on his phone buxom girls [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5045.6s)]
*  in bikinis was googling ted bundy and stories about ted bundy took a look-alike photo of himself [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5053.2s)]
*  looking like ted bundy mark i mean we can get into some more of the details but the case against him [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5061.92s)]
*  just it's even stronger than we knew it's colossal and what you just described will be the words [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5068.64s)]
*  flowing from the prosecutor's lips to establish that this crime was especially cold calculated [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5075.6s)]
*  and premeditated ccp which is one of the aggravators the other one is hack heinous atrocious and cruel [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5083.2s)]
*  and that's why i predict that his attorneys will go to the nearest sports goods store and purchase [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5091.280000000001s)]
*  knee pads and get down on their knees and beg for life as opposed to death [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5097.4400000000005s)]
*  the um we'll go through some of it in more detail and let's be honest we haven't heard as much from [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5104.72s)]
*  the defense dateline didn't really play up how the defense is going to handle each of these [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5110.88s)]
*  um they did feature howard bloom who's on this show a lot who is very fair to the defense not [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5115.280000000001s)]
*  as fair as brian's fans want him to be but i think he's very fair but my point is simply we [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5121.04s)]
*  haven't been given like a close-up preview of the defense and how they're going to argue all this [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5125.2s)]
*  here's kate morrison on it and in their defense you know each one of these search could be innocuous [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5129.2s)]
*  searching ted bundy doesn't make you a serial killer and looking up certain things but when [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5137.2s)]
*  you put it all together i mean you know again he enjoys the presumption of innocence like anybody [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5142.4s)]
*  but there's only one picture that uh emerges yeah i mean it's not abnormal for young college-age men [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5147.36s)]
*  to have pictures of beautiful girls on their phone it's also not unusual after this crime happened [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5155.04s)]
*  for any american to google idaho murders which they found him doing like that doesn't make you [[01:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5161.839999999999s)]
*  the killer i certainly did it um so like that some of it is more innocuous but you know some [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5167.6s)]
*  of it is leaving your sheath leaving your knife sheath with your dna that's problematic that's [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5174.0s)]
*  all i'm saying yeah deeply and we got more on the car footage uh his car on the night in question [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5178.88s)]
*  here is sat 27 this video obtained exclusively by datevine shows a white car on king road in [[01:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5185.84s)]
*  moscoeto on november 13th 2022 at the wheel the state will allege was brian kohberger making [[01:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5194.16s)]
*  repeated passes near a house where minutes later four students were stabbed to death [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5200.48s)]
*  okay and then there's more they had on um an fbi profiler named greg cooper who spoke to a little [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5207.44s)]
*  bit more about this watch it's not 28 that same week the week after the killings kohberger began [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5214.639999999999s)]
*  viewing or saving on his phone photos videos and news updates about the murders he did that at least [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5220.08s)]
*  60 times he was collecting everything all the reporting about the incident it's very common [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5226.08s)]
*  he's been watching all these things and last but not least um the ted bundy thing here's stop 30 [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5231.92s)]
*  in late december six weeks after the murders of maddie mogan kaylee gonzalves zanna crnodal and [[01:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5239.84s)]
*  ethan chafin record show kohberger a criminology student was again on his phone playing a clip [[01:27:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5245.2s)]
*  from a youtube program called ted bundy the essence of a psychopath within 24 hours of that [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5251.12s)]
*  two selfies kohberger dressed the same way bundy is pictured on that program [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5259.44s)]
*  it's so creepy it's just so creepy again you can explain it away every single fact doesn't mean [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5267.12s)]
*  that he's guilty of anything but you put it all together it's not only bad for the defense but [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5274.96s)]
*  it's so creepy and disturbing does that even come in though the the fact that he was googling ted [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5280.4800000000005s)]
*  bundy and took a look-alike picture of himself as ted bundy i'd want to i'd want to put that in [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5286.8s)]
*  are you kidding me i think it goes to the weight and you let the jury decide how much weight if [[01:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5292.24s)]
*  any you're going to give it you don't keep it out well what on what ground is it relevant he's [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5297.28s)]
*  interested a lot of people are interested in true crime in serial killers i mean i can see the [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5302.72s)]
*  defense actually keeping this out i can see the defense not wanting it in for sure because it [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5307.12s)]
*  doesn't help them and i could see a judge saying why should i exclude it if i'm doing a 403 balancing [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5314.0s)]
*  is it more prejudicial than probative i don't know i think there's value to it i think you let [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5320.0s)]
*  the jury decide on this one it's not good um okay there's more weeks before the murders he searched [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5325.12s)]
*  for dozens of photos of female students from both washington state and university of idaho and [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5332.24s)]
*  pictures from some of these accounts were of friends or followers of the three female victims [[01:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5336.639999999999s)]
*  they don't allege that they were of those three female victims so that that's interesting he in [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5344.4s)]
*  late september 2022 so this is two months before the murders he was a phd student at nearby [[01:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5351.28s)]
*  washington state university he searched terms such as sociopathic traits in college student [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5356.96s)]
*  and pornography containing keywords drugged and sleeping and you know mark as far as we know there [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5364.88s)]
*  was no sexual assault i mean honestly i don't think there was time for sexual assault the murders took [[01:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5371.44s)]
*  place since like over 12 minutes 12 to like 18 minutes at the most and he killed four people [[01:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5375.36s)]
*  but one does wonder if he's searching that whether he had some other plan you know if he hadn't [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5381.599999999999s)]
*  found maddie mogan in bed with another woman he also had to kill like what what was he planning [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5388.72s)]
*  in october 2022 he's getting closer to the murders he searched can psychopaths behave [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5395.44s)]
*  pro-socially which is very disturbing but the thing is mark a lot of this the defense is just [[01:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5402.08s)]
*  going to say he was a phd student in criminology of course he was interested in ted bundy the [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5408.48s)]
*  murders and questions about psychopaths and sociopaths absolutely there's definitely going [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5414.48s)]
*  to be an explanation for every single thing even the bizarre behavior of circling his vehicle around [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5420.5599999999995s)]
*  the crime scene you know they're going to bring in as soon as they possibly can although the judge [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5426.639999999999s)]
*  has made a little bit difficult that he suffers for from autism albeit mild but maybe that's [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5432.5599999999995s)]
*  consistent with that type of behavior they're going to explain away all the bizarre behavior [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5437.68s)]
*  but you know just like you can explain away slurred speech you can explain away bloodshot [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5442.4800000000005s)]
*  eyes you can explain somebody having difficulty driving when you put all the pieces of the puzzle [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5446.4800000000005s)]
*  together you know it equals dui and in this case it equals a really abhorrent offense [[01:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5451.4400000000005s)]
*  the k-bar knife you mentioned that the knife sheath was left behind dateline speculated that [[01:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5457.6s)]
*  it may have it may have like fallen out in a struggle it may have been in the context of [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5464.0s)]
*  that struggle that happened on the second floor but but my understanding was that they found that [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5468.8s)]
*  with the first two victims on the third floor maddie and kaylee so i'm not sure now it raised [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5472.96s)]
*  questions for me was the knife sheath found underneath one of the two girls and their bodies [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5478.48s)]
*  or was it down on the floor beneath them with ethan and zana lost during a struggle we'll find [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5484.72s)]
*  out more this summer when we hear actual testimonies opposed to speculations but [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5490.56s)]
*  this was revealed prior to dateline we found out that after the murders he had searched on amazon [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5495.52s)]
*  for another k-bar knife which is just shocking and and howard bloom broke that news here on the show [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5503.4400000000005s)]
*  he talked to us about it and i asked him do you think he was looking for a replacement knife sheath [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5510.4800000000005s)]
*  so that if the cops came he was like that's not mine and he said maybe or maybe he wanted [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5517.5199999999995s)]
*  to commit more murder and he had disposed of the murder weapon and it worked so well [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5524.4s)]
*  he was looking to do it again here is a little bit from the dateline special on that [[01:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5529.599999999999s)]
*  knife soft 29 after the murders investigators discovered a sheath from a k-bar knife apparently [[01:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5534.96s)]
*  left by the killer in one of the victim's beds dna found on that sheath has been linked to brian [[01:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5540.5599999999995s)]
*  coberger dateline was the first to report that coberger bought a k-bar knife seven months before [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5546.08s)]
*  the murders and now we've obtained records showing that after the murders coberger was back on amazon [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5551.92s)]
*  looking at k bars he even clicked buy now and began the checkout process before exiting [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5558.08s)]
*  okay so that last part is interesting that he clicked buy now because what howard told us was [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5566.48s)]
*  that and taylor the lawyer had initially suggested oh that k-bar knifing only came up in his amazon [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5572.24s)]
*  because like if they hear you mention knife in the context of a conversation you know they do [[01:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5580.719999999999s)]
*  target target it adds and that so but if he clicked buy now it's a different story of course and of [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5586.0s)]

*  argument likely it's not going to be the challenge the you know the effectiveness of dna they'll say [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bUoehOibOw&t=5596.4s)]
