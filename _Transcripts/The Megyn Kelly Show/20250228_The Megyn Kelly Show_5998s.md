Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Emily Jashinsky, host of "Undercurrents" on UnHerd, to discuss the botched release of the "Epstein Files," how Pam Bondi over-promised and under-delivered on the documents, how it left key MAGA influencers embarrassed, whether we'll ever get real information about Epstein's clients, Andrew Tate’s return to the U.S., his history of disgusting comments and disturbing allegations against him, some on the right promoting him, Megyn's recent contentious interview with Ben Smith at the Semafor Summit, his condescending take about the show, the media’s hypocrisy when it comes to a "gentlemen's agreement" to not attack others in the press, and more. Then Anna Khachiyan and Dasha Nekrasova, hosts of the Red Scare podcast, to discuss the heated exchange between Ukrainian President Zelensky and President Trump and VP Vance in the Oval Office, how this could affect the potential for peace in the region, the latest drama involving Elon Musk and his alleged baby's mom Ashley St. Clair, new messages that show she wanted to have Elon's "rocket babies," whether she's playing the victim now, the storylines ahead of the Oscars this weekend, how the "trans" Best Actress nominee has now been canceled over past posts, Monica Lewinksy’s recent interview on the Call Her Daddy podcast, her inability to move past the Bill Clinton scandal, and more.

# Trump Fights with Zelensky in Oval Office, and Epstein Files Debacle, w/ Emily Jashinsky & Red Scare
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Friday. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1.32s)]
*  It's a busy end to the week today with Ukrainian president Zelensky at the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3.88s)]
*  White House this morning and a meeting with president Trump that could be the [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=8.44s)]
*  first real step toward peace in Ukraine. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  Plus Andrew Tate back in America. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=14.52s)]
*  Oh joy. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=18.56s)]
*  The Epstein files were a total bust and I have a lot to say about my day in [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=20.36s)]
*  Washington, D.C. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=25.639999999999997s)]
*  yesterday in front of all the media head honchos. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=27.08s)]
*  Joining me later in the studio today, the ladies of Red Scare, but first [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=31.24s)]
*  Emily Jeschinski, D.C. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=35.2s)]
*  correspondent for Unheard and host of Undercurrents. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=36.839999999999996s)]

*  Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=42.84s)]
*  These days, personal safety is not something that can be left to chance, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=48.239999999999995s)]
*  whether at home, on the road or just living everyday life, having a reliable way [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=51.08s)]
*  to protect yourself and your family is crucial. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=54.96s)]
*  This is why Berna is the choice for many. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=57.4s)]
*  Berna is a game changing, less lethal self-defense tool, compact, powerful [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  and easy to use. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=64.44s)]
*  It provides the confidence to act in any situation, even if you don't want to [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=65.6s)]
*  use a gun. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=70.08s)]
*  Some people love their guns. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=70.84s)]
*  Some people don't. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=72.24000000000001s)]
*  This is for everyone. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=73.68s)]
*  See, Berna uses non-lethal rounds, tear gas, pepper and kinetic projectiles to [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=75.28s)]
*  effectively stop a threat from a safe distance. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=80.04s)]
*  And the best part is it can be shipped directly to your door and it's legal in [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  all 50 states. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=86.84s)]
*  Berna is proudly American with products and assembled in Fort Wayne, Indiana. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=88.76s)]
*  Sometimes a firearm isn't the right option for you or it's not the only option [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=92.48s)]
*  you want. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=96.64s)]
*  And Berna provides a powerful choice. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=97.24000000000001s)]
*  Protect what matters most with Berna. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=99.88000000000001s)]
*  Visit Berna.com. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=101.72s)]
*  That's B-Y-R-N-A dot com slash Megan. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=102.80000000000001s)]

*  to Berna's less lethal protection. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=111.47999999999999s)]
*  Berna, non-lethal self-defense, always ready. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=114.24s)]
*  EJ, how's it going? [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=118.56s)]
*  I think between me, Anna and Dasha, this is the most Slavic episode of the Megan [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=120.96s)]
*  Kelly show ever. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=125.28s)]
*  If I could just get Melania. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=128.07999999999998s)]
*  Necrusova, Katjian. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=129.44s)]
*  Yeah, seriously. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=130.6s)]
*  I love it. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=134.28s)]
*  And not coincidentally, very beautiful women as well. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=134.79999999999998s)]
*  All right. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=139.48000000000002s)]
*  Let's start with the absolute bust of Epstein. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=139.76000000000002s)]
*  I, this was such a joke. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=142.28s)]
*  So I'm not, everything about this was poorly handled. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=145.04000000000002s)]
*  Like I'm, I'm a big Pam Bondi fan. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=148.36s)]
*  I love that she's running DOJ. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  One of the things she's doing right now, which I greatly appreciate is she's [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=153.44s)]
*  dropping all the bullshit Biden DOJ investigations into various police and [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=156.48000000000002s)]
*  fire forces across the country for not lowering their test standards so that [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=162.32s)]
*  more women could get involved or changing the tests so that more African-Americans [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=166.92s)]
*  qualified than actually passed the test. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=171.32s)]
*  They were getting sued by Biden's DOJ left and right. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=173.84s)]
*  Today she's dropping them all. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=177.04s)]
*  Great. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=178.24s)]
*  She's doing a great job, but the Epstein file thing was a disaster. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=179.0s)]
*  They embarrassed themselves and it seems like a totally unnecessary thing. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=183.6s)]
*  Like they stepped on a rake for no apparent reason. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=189.48s)]
*  What happened yesterday was a bunch of right-wing influencers were invited to [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=193.28s)]
*  the white house and they were given binders that said like Epstein phase one, [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=196.48s)]
*  like the phase one release. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=202.16s)]
*  Um, okay. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=204.28s)]
*  That was interesting. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=205.56s)]
*  You know, it was, I'm not going to lie. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=207.51999999999998s)]
*  This was a little awkward because it was very celebratory and the Epstein story [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=209.16s)]
*  is about his alleged molestation and inappropriate behavior with very young [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=214.48s)]
*  girls. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=219.48s)]
*  So it's just one of those things. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=220.32s)]
*  You got to be careful because you don't want to look like you're celebrating [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=221.72s)]
*  anything having to do with that. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=225.4s)]
*  But I understand that the, the celebration was around the fact that finally we might [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=227.08s)]
*  be getting the full story on Epstein. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=231.0s)]
*  So they got those files, those folders from Pam Bondi. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=233.88s)]
*  It sat in a meeting, according to them with Pam Bondi who gave him the files. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=236.88s)]
*  Like here they are. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=240.48000000000002s)]
*  Here's tranche one and absolutely nothing was in them. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=241.36s)]
*  It came out later from those influencers among others who I think were also [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=244.8s)]
*  disappointed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=249.04000000000002s)]
*  Um, nothing else. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=250.12s)]
*  Absolutely everything in there was already known. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=251.24s)]
*  Not a single new thing was, was printed or offered. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=253.23999999999998s)]
*  And this whole thing had been some sort of a rope a dope. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=256.68s)]
*  I don't think it was designed to make any of the right wing influencers look [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=259.84s)]
*  dumb, but they were not well served by the DOJ yesterday that the DOJ should have [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=263.56s)]
*  been more careful before they did that to some of the most ardent allies to the [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=268.88s)]
*  Trump administration. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  It was kind of bullshit. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=274.56s)]
*  I was pissed on their behalf. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=276.32s)]
*  And then by the end of the day, what you had was Pam Bondi firing off a nasty [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=278.36s)]
*  missive to cash Patel saying, where are my files? [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=282.36s)]
*  I demanded from the FBI that they all be given to me. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=286.28000000000003s)]
*  They weren't. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  I've been told by a whistleblower, the FBI withheld certain critical Epstein [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=289.08000000000004s)]
*  documents. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=293.88s)]
*  When I spoke to you earlier, you were as surprised by this as I was. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=294.44s)]
*  So then why did they go through the exercise of doing this with the [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=298.0s)]
*  influencers? [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Cause it looks like the timing on that was she knew before she gave them those [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=304.56s)]
*  binders that she had been strong armed or stiff armed by the FBI. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=308.56s)]
*  And so the whole thing wound up being somewhat embarrassing unnecessarily for, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=314.59999999999997s)]
*  I think the well-meaning right wing influencers that showed up there willing [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=319.15999999999997s)]
*  to report on whatever news was given to them. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=323.24s)]
*  PS, it was nothing on Pam on cash Patel. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=325.64s)]
*  And for what? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=330.08s)]
*  Why? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=331.12s)]
*  I don't, why did this have to happen? [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=331.71999999999997s)]
*  I think you just hit on the crux of the problem for them, which is they were on [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=334.20000000000005s)]
*  the one hand, they're trying to have it both ways. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=338.48s)]
*  On the one hand, they were saying this was a big document dump, the first step [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=340.20000000000005s)]
*  towards total transparency. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=343.56s)]
*  They're about to purge the deep state and expose names. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=344.92s)]
*  And that's basically what Pam Bondi said on Jesse water show the other night [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=348.72s)]
*  before the night before all of this happened. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=352.64000000000004s)]
*  And then they want to have it the other way too, which is that, well, we always [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=354.48s)]
*  knew this was going to be underwhelming because we were being thwarted by the [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=358.72s)]
*  Southern district of New York. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=362.6s)]
*  So it doesn't make sense that they actually went public and said, this is, [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=363.4s)]
*  you know, a huge step towards transparency. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=367.4s)]
*  And then at the same time also said, actually it's nothing because we're [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=369.72s)]
*  being thwarted by the deep state. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=373.32s)]
*  Like two of those two things can't be true at the same time. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=374.6s)]
*  And it seems like they were in a rush to get documents out because [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=377.2s)]
*  they're under a lot of pressure. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=381.48s)]
*  This was a huge Trump pledge to actually release all kinds of information, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=382.68s)]
*  whether it's JFK files, MLK, the whole thing. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=386.8s)]
*  This is going to be a really big problem for Pam Bondi and Megan. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=389.72s)]
*  I don't know if you've sensed this. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=392.76s)]
*  I've sensed the White House is really upset with the Department of Justice [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=394.2s)]
*  over this, just talking to people in the last 24 hours. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=397.56s)]
*  Like they feel this was a huge error because the optics were so bad because [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=400.72s)]
*  it turned so many people in Mago world against each other so early in the [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=405.08s)]
*  administration, it may seem like a silly sideshow thing, but I actually think [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=409.68s)]
*  it was a pretty serious mistake. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=413.48s)]
*  And I think that's a big mistake. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=415.16s)]
*  Like a silly sideshow thing, but I actually think it was a pretty [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=416.6s)]
*  significant blunder that's going to have ripple effects in the days and weeks to come. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=419.64s)]
*  I felt bad for those influencers. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=423.8s)]
*  I mean, many of whom I know and think a lot of who got, I'm sure very excited [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=425.36s)]
*  by the call to go meet with the attorney general of the United States. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=431.36s)]
*  This is not like somebody punked me who I never heard of before who claimed [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=435.04s)]
*  he had Epstein documents. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=439.16s)]
*  It's the sitting attorney general. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=440.44s)]
*  And they went, they're at the White House. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=442.68s)]
*  Like this is a big deal. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=445.0s)]
*  I think they went there totally in good faith and earnestly and trusted her and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=446.71999999999997s)]
*  got humiliated by this document dump that was a nothing. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=453.44s)]
*  Why would you take people who absolutely love you and have been very good to you [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=459.15999999999997s)]
*  and embarrass them like this? [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=462.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't get it. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=463.92s)]
*  I'm sure it wasn't intentional. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=465.08s)]
*  I think it was just incompetence, I guess. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=467.28s)]
*  I'm not sure exactly how this went down. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=469.36s)]
*  But if I were any one of those people, I would be demanding an actual explanation [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=471.6s)]
*  of what was done to me and the real information be given to me ASAP. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=477.36s)]
*  Right? Like now I've stuck my neck out for you. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=482.12s)]
*  You've humiliated me. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=484.48s)]
*  I better be getting whatever the FBI and or SDNY, [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=485.96000000000004s)]
*  Southern District of New York, has some of the documents [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=489.92s)]
*  since they were the ones going after Epstein. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=492.88s)]
*  I better be the first one to receive this stuff. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=495.32s)]
*  Right? Like instead, yesterday, we just seemed to have the nasty [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=497.24s)]
*  letter from Pam Bondi to Cash Patel, like, gee, everyone's been duped. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=501.2s)]
*  But again, the timeline appears to be she knew that before [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=506.96s)]
*  she gave out these documents. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=511.28s)]
*  Then on top of it, they gave all the right wing influencers talking points [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=512.56s)]
*  that sort of explain what happened and like how great this whole sequence of events was. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=517.16s)]
*  And I guess they didn't tell them this. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=524.36s)]
*  This is just guidance for you. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=526.92s)]
*  And a couple of them tweeted out the exact same message [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=529.76s)]
*  afterward that reads as follows. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=533.64s)]
*  Today, I met with President Trump. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=535.16s)]
*  Yes, it's not just Bondi. It's Trump. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=537.04s)]
*  President Trump, Vice President J.D. Vance, AG Pam Bondi [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=539.28s)]
*  and FBI Director Cash Patel in the Oval. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=542.16s)]
*  They handed me a binder copy of the Epstein files, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=544.92s)]
*  the most transparent administration in American history. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=547.0s)]
*  The best part, this is just the start. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=549.64s)]
*  AG Bondi confirmed there are thousands more Epstein file documents [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=551.6s)]
*  being secretly held in the SDNY, and they will be delivered to the DOJ [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=555.4399999999999s)]
*  in D.C. by February 28th, which is today. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=559.4s)]
*  People will be going to jail for what they've done. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=561.72s)]
*  So she gave them this guidance to tweet out, [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=563.72s)]
*  oh, this is just the first tranche, but more is coming, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=568.12s)]
*  which was an attempt and a nod at her knowledge that she didn't have anything in there [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=570.84s)]
*  that was new. But that wasn't transparent. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=574.88s)]
*  Right. That wasn't actually made clear. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=577.4s)]
*  And then these guys are tweeting out the exact same tweet. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=580.44s)]
*  Right. Like they just. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=585.84s)]
*  And the way that's avoided is you say this is a guide. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=588.24s)]
*  This is guidance. This is like a suggested tweet. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=591.0s)]
*  Obviously, I wouldn't send out this exact thing. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=594.04s)]
*  We're we're giving this to everybody. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=595.88s)]
*  These are kind of the points would be great if you could hit. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=597.44s)]
*  Now, if you're a journalist, you don't take that at all. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=599.84s)]
*  You say thank you for your tweet. Goodbye. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=602.44s)]
*  But these are I don't think they would call themselves exactly journalists [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=604.6800000000001s)]
*  in the traditional sense, which is one of the things we love about them. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=607.92s)]
*  But I just feel like if you wanted to embarrass these, you know, 10 people, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=611.96s)]
*  this is exactly how you would run this whole thing. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=616.2s)]
*  You couldn't have scripted it better. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=619.2s)]
*  No, I mean, it was incredibly humiliating. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=620.64s)]
*  That makes them end up looking like Pravda, like they're taking talking points [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=623.0s)]
*  and being the useful idiots for the administration's complete blunder [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=626.5600000000001s)]
*  on promising, over promising and wildly under delivering. [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=631.64s)]
*  So I actually think this is going to be a problem. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=635.88s)]
*  I'm I'm with you, Megan. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=638.16s)]
*  Like I have pretty high hopes for Pam Bondi and definitely for Kash Patel as well. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=639.24s)]
*  But this to me feels like it'll be a big problem going forward for Pam Bondi. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=643.36s)]
*  Because people like in fact, some of these influencers, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=648.16s)]
*  some of their staunchest allies on social media are not going to give up [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=650.64s)]
*  on looking for these files and trying to get these files. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=655.68s)]
*  Pam Bondi was the attorney general in the state of Florida, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=658.1999999999999s)]
*  an attorney general in the state of Florida over the time period [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=661.4s)]
*  when she was there, would know a lot of stuff about what was happening [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=664.12s)]
*  with the Jeffrey Epstein case, presumably. [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=667.52s)]
*  And so there's just going to be a lot of questions. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=669.7199999999999s)]
*  Remember, Alex Acosta, Trump's first labor secretary, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=671.6s)]
*  was really involved in the sweetheart deal. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=675.0s)]
*  Like this is this is the Florida connections are great here. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=677.52s)]
*  So I think this is going to follow Pam Bondi, unfortunately. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=681.76s)]
*  I mean, everybody's still interested in Epstein, I think. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=685.24s)]
*  I heard some people who cares. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=687.64s)]
*  No, I care. I actually really would like to see what's in the files if if. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=689.36s)]
*  Look, I'm not expecting it to be like appointment. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=694.0s)]
*  Bill Clinton to see 13 year old on Epstein Island, you know, June 2006. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=696.68s)]
*  That's not going to be in there. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=702.4s)]
*  That's just a joke. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=704.24s)]
*  But there could be a client list right now. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=705.6s)]
*  It's just his contact list, which we've already seen. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=709.72s)]
*  And by the way, being in Jeffrey Epstein's contact book [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  does not mean anything. It really doesn't mean anything. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=714.96s)]
*  Like I have tons of people in my phone's contacts with whom [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=717.5600000000001s)]
*  I actually have almost nothing to do. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=720.2s)]
*  Whatever they they contact you one time, you exchange info doesn't mean anything. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=722.12s)]
*  What we need is more like who actually was a frequent [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=726.88s)]
*  repeat visitor on Epstein Island, right? [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=731.12s)]
*  That would be good to know. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=733.44s)]
*  We have some names. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=735.4000000000001s)]
*  But what's being promised is like there's more and it's juicy. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=737.5600000000001s)]
*  And that's why it's been withheld by these people. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=741.72s)]
*  And maybe something about his death, like people have [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=744.4000000000001s)]
*  genuine natural questions about that. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=747.6s)]
*  Do you think we'll get any answers? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=749.96s)]
*  I think it's going to be really difficult for them to not provide answers. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=753.2s)]
*  And the question for me is, do the answers they provide [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=756.96s)]
*  continue to sort of look like what yesterday looked like? [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=759.84s)]
*  And I mean that when it comes to JFK, MLK and all of that, [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=762.56s)]
*  because Trump was on Joe Rogan as he was courting young men, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=765.8s)]
*  a very important demographic for him in this last election, [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=770.52s)]
*  talking about how this stuff was all going to come out. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=774.16s)]
*  And so is it just going to be an underwhelming drip, drip, drip, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=776.64s)]
*  as a lot of cynics always predicted, or is there going to be [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=780.64s)]
*  substantial information release? [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=783.76s)]
*  I have a really hard time seeing them politically getting away [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=785.04s)]
*  with not infuriating all of that. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=788.68s)]
*  Like, again, some of the same people that were at the White House yesterday, [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=791.24s)]
*  if all this time goes by and they never produce anything, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=793.6s)]
*  I think the hope is that what they don't keep trying to do [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=798.12s)]
*  is manipulating the public by tossing scraps and acting like it's a really big deal. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=800.76s)]
*  There are potential loopholes in the JFK, EO. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=806.24s)]
*  I actually sent a comment request to the CIA a couple of weeks ago [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=808.88s)]
*  about whether they're planning to use some of those loopholes, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=811.6s)]
*  and they gave me a non-response. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=813.92s)]
*  But this stuff is going to build. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=815.44s)]
*  We're a month into office, so I don't really think they have a choice. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=817.12s)]
*  One thing we know quickly that the FBI has is disks that were confiscated [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=820.72s)]
*  from Jeffrey Epstein's townhouse that have like blank name plus [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=825.36s)]
*  blank name on these disks. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=831.0s)]
*  They said that these are things that they took from the Epstein townhouse in New York. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=832.88s)]
*  So there really are specific, tangible records. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=836.96s)]
*  We know they have. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=840.72s)]
*  And as those questions keep building and building, good luck [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=842.24s)]
*  if you're going to continue ignoring that after promising so much. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=845.76s)]
*  Mm hmm. I mean, it's it's [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=848.96s)]
*  I think it was Elon who tweeted out today like things don't change on a dime. [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=851.5600000000001s)]
*  And I think he was suggesting [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=856.5600000000001s)]
*  Pam Bondi is there, Cash Patel is there. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=858.84s)]
*  But the whole staff hasn't changed at DOJ or FBI and certainly not at SDNY. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=860.6800000000001s)]
*  And so I think he was telegraphing like, give him a minute [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=866.6800000000001s)]
*  to try to get the troops in line. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=870.52s)]
*  I agree with all of that, yes. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=872.16s)]
*  But then don't over promise. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=873.72s)]
*  Don't make a big show of things. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=875.36s)]
*  Don't embarrass your most loyal supporters by pretending [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=876.88s)]
*  you're giving them some big scoop, only to have the Internet say [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=879.72s)]
*  there's absolutely nothing here at all. [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=882.8s)]
*  That's new. Like all of this is just like I say, it's like the procedure [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=885.24s)]
*  around it was so poorly done. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=889.24s)]
*  And then on top of everything we just discussed, for some reason, [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=891.4s)]
*  the House Judiciary Committee, which I gather is run by Jim Jordan, [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=894.48s)]
*  tweeted out like a joke about it. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=900.24s)]
*  People expected like the tease was suggested that they look, it reads up breaking. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=903.2800000000001s)]
*  It's at Judiciary GOP, Epstein files released. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=910.12s)]
*  And you click on this link and it shows you the well, here's what it shows you. [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=913.6800000000001s)]
*  Referred to as being Rick rolled, which is like a punk. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=932.96s)]
*  So they wound up having to delete that tweet because so many Republicans [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=936.76s)]
*  and conservatives did not find it funny and were just generally pissed off [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=942.8000000000001s)]
*  about how the afternoon went yesterday. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=946.48s)]
*  Well, yeah, and it's totally missing the moment. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=949.2800000000001s)]
*  It's completely tone deaf. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=951.32s)]
*  And what they were trying to do, I suspect from that was throw SDNY. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=952.5600000000001s)]
*  They were trying to troll SDNY and say, you know, this is what happens [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=956.8000000000001s)]
*  when you try to get records from the deep state. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=960.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, you're just going to keep getting Rick rolled. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=963.1999999999999s)]
*  So I think it was intended to have that target. [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=964.9599999999999s)]
*  But it was indicative of how indelicately the situation was handled for a [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=968.36s)]
*  very serious matter to many, many people in the whole country, [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=973.56s)]
*  but especially in the Trump base. [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=977.16s)]
*  It was just yesterday was a real disaster for them. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=979.24s)]
*  And they kind of knew it. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=982.4s)]
*  You sense that they knew it as it was happening, that it was a disaster. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=983.4s)]
*  And we're trying to cover their asses. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=986.28s)]
*  Here's the other thing that bothered me about it. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=988.28s)]
*  There are people there like Chaya from Libs of Tik Tok, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=990.0s)]
*  even Jack Psobiak, who with whom I have a very checkered past, [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=994.32s)]
*  like we haven't gotten along well. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=998.0s)]
*  But I have to say he's I've grown to really like him. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=999.96s)]
*  And his Twitter feed is fire. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1003.56s)]
*  And he actually has had a lot of scoops. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1006.48s)]
*  He was one of them. [[00:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1009.32s)]
*  Chad Pranther. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1010.32s)]
*  He's a good guy down in Texas, a podcaster. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1012.08s)]
*  So. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1015.48s)]
*  The dragging these people to the White House and using them in this way, [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1017.0s)]
*  undermine their credibility, to which I object like Libs of Tik Tok has been [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1022.24s)]
*  she's been a hero, a heroine in this whole DEI battle, [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1028.08s)]
*  in the whole gender madness battle. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1033.04s)]
*  Like, truly, this to me almost seems like a Biden Psy op to try to undermine [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1035.48s)]
*  the growing credibility of independent people who have been breaking big news. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1040.0s)]
*  And important voices in our country. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1046.0s)]
*  And it was like, how can we take the legs out from under them? Right. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1049.64s)]
*  So it's like, look, they'll recover. [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1052.12s)]
*  Nobody's blaming them. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1054.6s)]
*  I think, you know, people understand this was done to them, not exactly by them. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1055.8s)]
*  But now you've also put them in a position where they feel like they have to defend [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1060.68s)]
*  the White House because they were given this, quote, scoop and met with the president. [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1063.4s)]
*  You know, it's like all very fraught. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1067.8s)]
*  And some that I don't know. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1070.2s)]
*  I'm not sure if somebody's head needs to roll, but like. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1071.96s)]
*  Something should be done. [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1074.84s)]
*  If I were Pam Bondi, I'd definitely be giving these people the exclusive [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1075.72s)]
*  of the real information so that you can rehabilitate the people you for some reason hurt. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1078.56s)]
*  Yeah. And part of what this looks like to me is they they actually were trying [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1084.2s)]
*  to bring influencers in and give scoops to people who have cared about the issue [[00:18:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1087.1200000000001s)]
*  and have been supportive of the administration. [[00:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1092.16s)]
*  And when they realized that this was going to be like not what they promised, [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1094.52s)]
*  they still tried to go ahead with it. [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1100.8s)]
*  And they laid the spin on extra thick to make up for under delivering, [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1102.36s)]
*  which is a horrible, horrible idea. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1107.3999999999999s)]
*  You can see how when things are happening really quickly, like it's Veep behind closed [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1109.76s)]
*  doors in D.C., you would do something like this. [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1113.9599999999998s)]
*  But it is really, really stupid. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1116.9599999999998s)]
*  I think probably at someone's head should roll because they took a lot of built up [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1118.6799999999998s)]
*  credibility with these online influencers who have been supportive of them, have [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1122.6799999999998s)]
*  stuck their necks out for them. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1127.0s)]
*  And this is a reputation blow. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1129.1999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I agree. [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1130.84s)]
*  I think they'll recover. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1131.52s)]
*  But for some people, they'll probably never have the same level of reputation in [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1132.52s)]
*  us in one way, though. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1137.24s)]
*  I think this could be a good thing, which is my advice to people who start covering [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1138.24s)]
*  Trump world is that they are really friendly if you're supportive. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1141.8799999999999s)]
*  But if you want them to take you seriously, you have to like kind of be serious [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1145.2s)]
*  and be, you know, show that you're willing to be extremely skeptical. [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1151.32s)]
*  The people that they take most seriously are the ones that are willing to like [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1154.96s)]
*  play hardball, too. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1159.36s)]
*  And so I think in a sense, for the influencers, this could be a good lesson [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1160.48s)]
*  that like you can be supportive. [[00:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1164.88s)]
*  Like if you support Donald Trump, great. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1167.2s)]
*  Like go support Donald Trump. [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1168.8000000000002s)]
*  But, you know, there are some people in his orbit that aren't always going to have [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1169.92s)]
*  your best interests in mind. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1173.68s)]
*  So be skeptical and be rigorous when you go into situations like these. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1175.16s)]
*  Well, it is complicated, right? [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1178.8400000000001s)]
*  Because there was a report yesterday that Trump had an event at the White House on [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1180.0800000000002s)]
*  women in sports, boys playing in girls sports and women in sports, and invited a [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1184.76s)]
*  group of outspoken women on this issue to the White House. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1189.76s)]
*  And online, there were there were some complaints that some of the women who had [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1193.32s)]
*  been invited to the first signing of the EO, like Riley Gaines and some of the [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1197.4s)]
*  others who've been in commercials with her and so on, were not invited back. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1201.44s)]
*  Oh, this is because I think because yesterday or the day before is about NCAA. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1205.56s)]
*  The NCAA made a deal of like going along with Trump's EO, like, OK, we're not [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1208.96s)]
*  going to allow boys and women sports. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1215.0s)]
*  And it turned out to be full of loopholes. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1217.0s)]
*  I mean, all of my women who I follow on this issue online have been jumping up [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1219.4s)]
*  and down very pissed off at the NCAA for trying to make it look like they're [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1224.64s)]
*  on board with the Trump EO, but actually creating a policy through which any [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1229.48s)]
*  truck could be driven. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1233.5600000000002s)]
*  And so the NCAA hasn't satisfied team reality when it comes to sex and gender [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1235.0800000000002s)]
*  at all, and they've been outspoken about it. [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1241.5600000000002s)]
*  And that includes Riley and some pointing out that she was not invited back. [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1244.2800000000002s)]
*  The White House saying, well, we just wanted to make room for other athletes. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1248.72s)]
*  But look, let's face it. [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1252.24s)]
*  You know, who among us hasn't been burned by criticizing, it could be the Trump, [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1254.1200000000001s)]
*  but White House could be the Biden, whatever someone in power with whom you [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1259.1200000000001s)]
*  were getting along and then you do something that pisses them off and you [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1262.88s)]
*  get put in the penalty box. [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1266.0s)]
*  I will say my own experience with Trump, and I think I'm a great person to speak [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1267.4s)]
*  to this is you may go into the penalty box for a time, but you will come out of [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1270.8400000000001s)]
*  the penalty box. [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1276.72s)]
*  Trump can get mad at you. [[00:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1277.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm sure his staff can get mad at you, but they're not real grudge holders. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1278.72s)]
*  So my advice to all these people is just hold on to your integrity, you know, [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1282.1599999999999s)]
*  report it as it comes, whatever, whether it makes them look bad or good in both [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1285.72s)]
*  your audience and the man you so admire will get past it. [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1290.1599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1296.6399999999999s)]
*  And, you know, be someone that they respect, not someone I'm not saying they [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1297.04s)]
*  should treat people flippantly. [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1301.6399999999999s)]
*  They shouldn't, especially people who have had their backs, but make them [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1303.28s)]
*  respect you. [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1305.96s)]
*  And this is a good lesson, I think, for people in Trump, in this administration, [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1307.2s)]
*  like respect the people who have been loyal to you. [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1311.4s)]
*  Otherwise you end up looking like jackasses. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1314.72s)]
*  And that's absolutely what happened yesterday. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1318.04s)]
*  So, I mean, it seems like this was just a moving catastrophe because they were [[00:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1320.16s)]
*  rushing to get stuff out. [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1325.44s)]
*  They knew they were under pressure. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1326.6000000000001s)]
*  And there are a million different ways this probably could have been avoided and [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1328.44s)]
*  could have done better. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1330.8400000000001s)]
*  But once the other wheels get turning in DC, things can get messy really quickly. [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1331.6000000000001s)]
*  So maybe it's a lesson, but I also just think this created a problem that's going [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1335.48s)]
*  to follow them. [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1339.56s)]
*  Like this is going to be a hole that they have to dig out of. [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1340.1200000000001s)]
*  It makes the demand on them to produce real records, like to really unseal things, [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1343.52s)]
*  to really declassify things, to really release things. [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1349.1200000000001s)]
*  I think this actually just ratcheted up the pressure on them. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1351.76s)]
*  They're not going to be able to get away as easily with not producing documents. [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1354.48s)]
*  I agree. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1358.6s)]
*  So we've botched round one of the big Epstein file release. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1359.2s)]
*  And at the same time in the news yesterday was the return of the despicable Tate [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1364.12s)]
*  brothers to the United States. [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1369.8s)]
*  Now, I don't know much about the brother Tristan, but I've seen enough about Andrew [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1371.9199999999998s)]
*  Tate to realize he's a disgusting pig misogynist. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1375.9199999999998s)]
*  And that's fine. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1379.76s)]
*  You can be a disgusting pig misogynist and live in the United States of America. [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1380.6799999999998s)]
*  It's really not much of my business. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1384.32s)]
*  His return to the United States. [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1387.6799999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1389.84s)]
*  I don't really care. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1390.2s)]
*  I mean, he's an American citizen. [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1391.08s)]
*  He's got dual citizenship, U.S. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1392.44s)]
*  and UK. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1394.24s)]
*  So I guess he's allowed to come back because supposedly these charges against him for sex [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1395.52s)]
*  trafficking, et cetera, in Romania, some have been dropped due to some prosecutorial [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1400.3200000000002s)]
*  negligence in the case and others are remaining. [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1406.0s)]
*  They're supposed to go back to Romania in the next year or so to go answer more. [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1409.64s)]
*  They're also facing potential charges in the UK. [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1413.72s)]
*  Same type of thing. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1416.52s)]
*  What I care about, because I don't know the legality and I haven't looked into them, so [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1418.04s)]
*  I'm not going to, you know, time up there. [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1421.16s)]
*  What I know is he's a disgusting vile creature with whom I want nothing to do. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1424.1200000000001s)]
*  And the more influence he has over the young men of America, the more my stomach turns. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1428.52s)]
*  And it's because Andrew Tate is not just an alleged criminal. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1433.16s)]
*  Put that to the side. [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1436.8400000000001s)]
*  He's just a very bad man. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1438.0800000000002s)]
*  And I'll give you an example in this butted sod that we've pulled, which will give you [[00:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1439.6000000000001s)]
*  a feel for why I loathe him. [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1443.64s)]
*  They didn't teach you in self-defense. [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1445.92s)]
*  Here's a little move. [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1447.76s)]
*  When I grab you by your neck and you start annoying me, trying to resist, and I just [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1448.68s)]
*  and then I grab you by your neck again. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1453.56s)]
*  Then what the fuck are you going to do when your face is collapsed and your fucking [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1455.04s)]
*  cheekbones broken? [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1457.8s)]
*  You ain't going to do shit but cry. [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1458.8s)]
*  I guarantee I changed the way you look at sex forever. [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1460.12s)]
*  You're going to be fucking crying. [[00:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1463.08s)]
*  I won't cry. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1464.52s)]
*  I bet you cry, bitch. [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1465.28s)]
*  I bet you fucking cry. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1466.72s)]
*  You're saying I wouldn't cry. [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1468.36s)]
*  You're challenging me to a fight. [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1469.56s)]
*  You're saying I can't hurt you. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1472.4s)]
*  You're out of your fucking mind? [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1474.4s)]
*  I don't even have to fuck you. [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1476.36s)]
*  Forget the sex part. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1477.8s)]
*  That's a distraction. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1478.76s)]
*  My dick can stay in my pants. [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1480.32s)]
*  I'll just start beating the shit out of you. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1481.32s)]
*  How about that? [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1482.6s)]
*  We walk in the bedroom. [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1483.04s)]
*  I start kicking your ass. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1484.08s)]
*  No sex. [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1485.72s)]
*  No sex involved. [[00:24:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1486.76s)]
*  But you cry then. [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1488.6799999999998s)]
*  I perfected this in pimp school. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1489.36s)]
*  When I got my PhD, we had to practice. [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1490.8799999999999s)]
*  If a girl comes at you, ah, you're cheating. [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1493.1599999999999s)]
*  You're cheating. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1495.9199999999998s)]
*  It's bang out the machete, boom in her face, and then grip her up by the neck. [[00:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1497.2s)]
*  But shut up, bitch. [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1501.76s)]
*  Her panties get wet. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1502.6s)]
*  Machetes on the floor. [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1504.04s)]
*  Her panties are all wet. [[00:25:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1505.2s)]
*  You go fuck her. [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1506.8s)]
*  That's how it goes. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1507.72s)]
*  Slap, slap, grab, choke, shut up, bitch. [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1508.56s)]
*  Sex is the basic moves of pimp. [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1512.12s)]
*  OK, credit to Milk Bar TV for putting together that montage. [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1517.24s)]
*  We have we have ones we could go through that would take us all day with young [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1521.36s)]
*  women in tears about what they claim he did to them about alleged beatings. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1524.8s)]
*  I mean, videotapes that purport to show that we haven't been [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1529.52s)]
*  independently able to verify this stuff. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1535.28s)]
*  So I'm not going to put it on the air. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1537.3999999999999s)]
*  I'm just saying there's a ton. [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1538.68s)]
*  You could swim in an ocean of that stuff around this guy all day long. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1540.08s)]
*  And for some reason, his status has somewhat divided conservatives. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1545.2s)]
*  Like there's a faction of the right that is celebrating him. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1550.8s)]
*  And I guess his brother, too, their return to the United States. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1555.44s)]
*  There was even a report that Rick Grinnell, who has been getting hostages [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1558.8799999999999s)]
*  out of places like Venezuela, was instrumental in orchestrating their return. [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1564.88s)]
*  He's denied it, but there was it's been admitted that he at least had a [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1570.1200000000001s)]
*  conversation, I think, with the Romanian foreign minister about the Tates. [[00:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1574.92s)]
*  Now he's claiming he didn't insist that they be allowed home, but suddenly [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1578.44s)]
*  they got released to come back home. [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1582.92s)]
*  So I don't know what the truth is there either. [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1585.5600000000002s)]
*  But I'll tell you what I do know. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1587.48s)]
*  And that is that there is a group called the Tampa Bay Young Republicans, [[00:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1588.68s)]
*  which is a young Republican group down in Tampa Bay that has decided to invite [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1594.0800000000002s)]
*  this guy and his brother to come speak to them. [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1600.1200000000001s)]
*  This is what they tweeted out. [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1604.48s)]
*  TBYR formally welcomes these two guys to Florida as free speech absolutists. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1605.88s)]
*  The Tates haven't been formally convicted of any crimes and are [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1610.8400000000001s)]
*  welcome to speak to our group. [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1613.68s)]
*  We're old enough to remember when a convicted felon won the presidency. [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1615.4s)]
*  Like every claim against any Republican is bullshit, Emily. [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1619.76s)]
*  And like all we really need to care about is whether you're facing criminal [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1624.0s)]
*  charges, as opposed to whether you're a piece of human excrement. [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1627.84s)]
*  Which by the way, actually makes, does it no favors to Donald Trump to lump him [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1633.68s)]
*  in to lump the lawfare against Donald Trump in with like extremely serious [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1638.4s)]
*  charges. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1643.76s)]
*  And I also am not like, I haven't gone deep into the weeds on whether or not [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1644.44s)]
*  there's some legitimate lawfare or weaponization happening against the [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1648.28s)]
*  Tate brothers. [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1651.6s)]
*  And they deny all the charges. [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1652.4s)]
*  I should remind people, but keep going. [[00:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1653.76s)]
*  Right. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1656.16s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1656.52s)]
*  And you know, that's what the Tampa Bay Young Republicans statement. [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1657.0s)]
*  I actually thought that was really interesting too, because they are [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1661.64s)]
*  directly drawing this line Trump to Tate, which is I think a pretty bad sign for [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1665.0s)]
*  the right. [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1670.28s)]
*  And when I talked to some young men, especially Bill, I mean, you could roll [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1670.8s)]
*  that montage for them and they would be like, yeah, we know we're not saying [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1675.16s)]
*  he's a good person. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1677.96s)]
*  We're saying he's right about masculinity and femininity. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1678.72s)]
*  And so the argument becomes like, don't throw the baby out with the bathwater. [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1682.68s)]
*  Like we know this guy is awful, but he's doing some good things for young men. [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1685.92s)]
*  He's speaking to us and he's entertaining us and appealing to us for all these [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1691.28s)]
*  reasons, because he's saying something about masculinity that the mainstream [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1695.8s)]
*  doesn't want to hear. [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1700.72s)]
*  Thus the charges against him are because people in the mainstream are just [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1702.6000000000001s)]
*  threatened and they don't believe in the differences between men and women, [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1707.56s)]
*  et cetera, which is true by the way. [[00:28:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1712.6s)]
*  But opposing Andrew Tate is not something that you do just because you are someone [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1715.1599999999999s)]
*  who's gatekeeping and are in the mainstream, which means that it ends up pushing [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1720.6399999999999s)]
*  people to affiliate with him. [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1724.84s)]
*  And so as much as I despise gatekeeping on the right and support free speech as [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1727.04s)]
*  the Tampa Bay young Republicans do, there's such a difference between appreciating [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1733.36s)]
*  the boundaries and understanding that free speech is real and important and actually [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1739.9199999999998s)]
*  then affiliating yourself with this dude. [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1746.2s)]
*  So it's kind of unfortunate that we're just in this situation. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1749.24s)]
*  And for young people, they're lost. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1752.2s)]
*  And it's no wonder that they end up going to gravitating towards someone like Andrew [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1754.52s)]
*  Tate, who, by the way, he is so emotional. [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1759.4399999999998s)]
*  You think he was a woman, Megan. [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1762.1599999999999s)]
*  I mean, the is the least masculine clips that I just saw. [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1763.6s)]
*  He's like running a multi-level marketing scheme like he's selling leggings on [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1768.3999999999999s)]
*  Facebook marketplace and whining about. [[00:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1772.2399999999998s)]
*  Truly such a baby. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1776.28s)]
*  And let's face it, I mean, only a sad little man would be talking about how he's [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1778.6799999999998s)]
*  going to beat the hell out of a woman. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1781.9199999999998s)]
*  He's out. I punch her in the face. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1783.36s)]
*  I punch her. But, oh, all right. [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1784.56s)]
*  Tough guy. OK, right. [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1785.8799999999999s)]
*  And now no real man would actually behave that way, never mind brag about it. [[00:29:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1787.52s)]
*  That's the thing. So it's like I look at the men I know in the conservative [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1791.36s)]
*  movement and they're absolutely lovely. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1795.3999999999999s)]
*  Most of them tend to be married. [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1797.72s)]
*  They have long term marriages. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1799.6799999999998s)]
*  They have families that they love and support. [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1801.32s)]
*  And there's there's absolutely nothing even questionable about their romantic [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1804.1599999999999s)]
*  choices or their love lives. [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1808.52s)]
*  I say nobody's ever made a mistake. [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1809.76s)]
*  I'm just saying that this is not representative at all of the new right. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1811.0s)]
*  And when we talk about what's been done to men and boys on the right, this is not [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1815.8799999999999s)]
*  the antidote. Like this actually is toxic masculinity, people. [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1820.56s)]
*  This is what the real version of it. [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1825.6799999999998s)]
*  And in our push to say stop using that absurd term over anybody who just stands [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1829.32s)]
*  up for himself and and man manliness, masculinity, stop using that term. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1835.36s)]
*  We're right. But then we too need to be able to look at the Andrew Tate's of the [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1840.6799999999998s)]
*  world and say, that's what you're looking for right there. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1844.32s)]
*  And we condemn it, too. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1847.2s)]
*  Yeah, it's so easy. [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1848.48s)]
*  And people like Josh Hawley and Ben Shapiro and you, Megan, have come out and been [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1849.48s)]
*  really clear on this. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1853.32s)]
*  Like you can be all for free speech and you can be against the less ridiculous [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1854.84s)]
*  standards about sex and gender and still say this guy is a piece of garbage. [[00:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1858.84s)]
*  He doesn't need to be listened to. [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1862.28s)]
*  You don't have to pay attention to him. [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1863.6399999999999s)]
*  I think the problem is that there are so many young men that have been poorly [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1865.36s)]
*  served by elites and by media that now they're way more susceptible to people [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1869.52s)]
*  like Andrew Tate who come in and offer something that feels sort of intoxicating [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1875.76s)]
*  and it feels like it's appealing to your masculinity. [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1880.12s)]
*  And it's like the problem. [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1883.28s)]
*  It's really, really dangerous then for anybody in, I think, Trump world, the new [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1885.48s)]
*  right to play footsie at all with with Tate because it validates that there's [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1889.76s)]
*  something going on there. [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1894.76s)]
*  And with him, there really isn't. [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1896.04s)]
*  Like, so I'm sorry that he has like a six pack. [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1897.84s)]
*  I don't think that makes him interesting or compelling as an example. [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1900.68s)]
*  At all. [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1904.68s)]
*  I mean, this guy's so vile. [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1905.28s)]
*  I really hope he doesn't get platformed by any group. [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1907.16s)]
*  Never mind a Republican group. [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1910.04s)]
*  Talk about bad for the brand. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1912.68s)]
*  There is a world of difference between Donald Trump and Andrew Tate. [[00:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1914.32s)]
*  Andrew Tate is what the left thinks Donald Trump is. [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1921.28s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1925.24s)]
*  Try not to lean in young Republicans. [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1926.32s)]
*  I really hope they reverse their notion of the left. [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1930.2s)]
*  I really hope they reverse their decision. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1933.28s)]
*  There's been no formal invitation. [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1934.9199999999998s)]
*  There's been no acceptance from what I've seen, but they're just proudly waving it [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1936.8s)]
*  around out there like they think this is a virtuous course. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1940.9199999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1945.28s)]
*  Shifting gears. [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1945.52s)]
*  Yesterday, I went down to Washington, D.C. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1946.8799999999999s)]
*  after I taped the show yesterday early in the morning, which is why I was a little [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1949.48s)]
*  shorter than normal because I had to catch a flight. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1953.28s)]
*  So I go down because Ben Smith, formerly of the New York Times, formerly of Buzzfeed, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1955.12s)]
*  now runs and founded Semaphore, which is trying to be a less partisan news outlet. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1959.72s)]
*  Like they do more than just politics. [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1964.48s)]
*  And he asked me if I would go down and speak at his like kind of conference. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1966.48s)]
*  And I said, yes, I know him a little bit from the summers. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1971.24s)]
*  He and I go to the same place on the Jersey Shore at times. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1973.36s)]
*  And so I said, yes. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1976.24s)]
*  And while I like Ben, I have to say my own experience was Ben doesn't understand [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1978.3999999999999s)]
*  what we're doing at all, not here at the Megyn Kelly show, not with what you do, [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1984.0s)]
*  Emily online, he's still stuck very much still in legacy media. [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1988.6s)]
*  And I would submit to the audience that his questions to me showed that it also [[00:33:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1992.84s)]
*  showed a lack of familiarity with what we do here on this particular show and what [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=1997.28s)]
*  I sound like in anchoring this show. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2002.1599999999999s)]
*  So I put together some of the questions just so you could see what I'm talking about. [[00:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2004.48s)]
*  Here's that montage of some of the questions. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2008.6799999999998s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2010.3999999999999s)]
*  Was a peer on stage with President Trump on November 4th, my birthday in Pittsburgh [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2011.32s)]
*  and say, President Trump gets it. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2016.16s)]
*  The reasons you're voting and list the reasons you're voting for him. [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2017.8400000000001s)]
*  Lot to do with masculinity, which I want to ask you about later. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2020.8s)]
*  And I wonder how you think about that in terms of, does it compromise you as a [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2023.8s)]
*  journalist? [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2027.88s)]
*  Do you even benefit from this environment in which people are losing trust in, in [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2028.3600000000001s)]
*  everyone else and turning to you? [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2031.8s)]
*  I think you probably, I think your audience probably, I would guess mostly [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2033.52s)]
*  voted for Trump, but I'm sure I know lots of people who watch you and didn't. [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2036.2s)]
*  Do you worry that they can't trust you that as you cover him going forward, that [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2039.0s)]
*  they'll kind of think you're in the tank, but ultimately you depend for information. [[00:34:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2042.3200000000002s)]
*  On the people that you're criticizing. [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2046.0s)]
*  Do you ever feel like it would be better if you had a producer occasionally, like [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2047.44s)]
*  in the old days being like Megan, maybe that's too much. [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2050.2400000000002s)]
*  I was talking to another broadcaster the other night and she said, you know, one [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2052.16s)]
*  thing Megan does that is most of us don't do is go after other people in [[00:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2054.88s)]
*  media really personally. [[00:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2059.36s)]
*  Like there's sort of a gentleman's agreement in a lot of media to not attack [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2060.32s)]
*  each other personally. [[00:34:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2063.8s)]
*  You had a very heated riff on him, forgetting her name, but the mother of [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2065.52s)]
*  Elon Musk's latest child. [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2067.88s)]
*  The bulk of YouTube is always going to be here is like an incredible monologue [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2069.6s)]
*  that went viral. [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2073.56s)]
*  Do you feel like you've been shaped by the medium that you've been pushed into [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2074.84s)]
*  these sort of like more heated monologues, these kind of, you know, these maybe more [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2077.6800000000003s)]
*  confrontation? [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2084.04s)]
*  I don't know that there's something about that kind of monologue that's about [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2084.52s)]
*  trying to go by. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2087.08s)]
*  Wait, wait, wait. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2087.76s)]
*  What I said about Elon's partner and the baby would have been nothing, but she [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2088.08s)]
*  decided to go public and then to play the victim. [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2094.08s)]
*  And my point was, you went after her. [[00:34:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2097.48s)]
*  Okay. [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2101.84s)]
*  So perhaps you've gotten a flavor of what Ben Smith thinks of the Megan Kelly [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2102.8799999999997s)]
*  show. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2107.3199999999997s)]
*  It does not appear that he is a daily watcher. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2108.8799999999997s)]
*  It appeals that he's, it appears he's been consuming his information about us [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2111.12s)]
*  from left-wing blogs, which is I guess not a surprise. [[00:35:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2113.8799999999997s)]
*  But I personally felt that that was a really gross, grossly unfair [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2117.92s)]
*  characterization in those questions. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2122.8799999999997s)]
*  And that's, those are the questions he asked. [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2124.92s)]
*  I think there was like, there were two others that weren't about, you know, my [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2126.3199999999997s)]
*  particular show that I just thought it was very slanted against what we do here. [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2129.0s)]
*  And he obviously, I think has an upturned nose when it comes to digital media in [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2134.92s)]
*  general. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2138.84s)]
*  And I'll give you one other just to kick it off, Emily. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2139.36s)]
*  And that is, you heard him say there that you spoke for president Trump the [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2142.64s)]
*  night before the election and you were very focused on masculinity. [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2146.36s)]
*  Like that's why you were voting for Donald Trump, masculinity, which is also [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2150.2400000000002s)]
*  totally false and not what I said at that rally. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2153.56s)]
*  What I said was he's under fire right now for having said he will protect women. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2157.2s)]
*  And I believe he will protect women. [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2162.44s)]
*  And I welcome that both on behalf of myself, my daughter and other people's [[00:36:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2164.92s)]
*  daughters, because I think he'll close the border and we won't have more Lake [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2169.52s)]
*  and Riley's and I think he'll close women's sports to men and boys. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2173.6s)]
*  And we mo we won't have more Peyton McNabs, the girl who got hurt in North [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2178.16s)]
*  Carolina, thanks to the spiked Bolly volleyball in her face. [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2182.3199999999997s)]
*  That's what I said. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2185.92s)]
*  And I also spoke of the forgotten boys in this country and what's been done to [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2186.76s)]
*  them as we've demonized boys over the past 10 years, not, it wasn't about [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2191.2000000000003s)]
*  fucking masculinity, but that's what a leftist hears when you say that kind of [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2195.84s)]
*  stuff about president Trump. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2200.52s)]
*  Anyway, your thoughts on it. [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2201.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, it would be if he had been peppering those questions to you as like [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2203.92s)]
*  a devil's advocate, that may have been different, but that's, I think you're [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2207.8s)]
*  right to say that's how he was actually characterizing the show. [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2211.7200000000003s)]
*  And it sounds to me like he's not familiar with like what you do regularly [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2214.52s)]
*  on the program at all. [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2219.04s)]
*  I agree because if you had been listening to or watching the show leading up to [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2219.92s)]
*  the election, you would have had all of the context of how seriously you took [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2224.48s)]
*  those issues, how deeply you covered those issues and how much they mattered to you, [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2228.92s)]
*  whether it was sports, immigration, whatever, and all of that would have made [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2232.44s)]
*  way more sense. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2236.36s)]
*  But if you're only getting your information sort of dripped out through, [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2237.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, the coverage from liberal bloggers and people on Twitter, then, yeah, [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2240.72s)]
*  that sort of sounds exactly like my impression of the questions. [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2245.96s)]
*  And by the way, another thing it misunderstands, I mean, I think even to ask [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2250.16s)]
*  the question about whether you wish you had a producer, I thought the implication [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2253.84s)]
*  was that, you know, maybe you're, you know, you're going off the rails too much [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2257.76s)]
*  or whatever. But by the way, the reason people like this medium is because of [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2261.6s)]
*  they get both the level of the quality and analysis and sophistication and [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2267.2s)]
*  political commentary, but they trust it more because they see you with no filter. [[00:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2272.0s)]
*  And that's the whole point. [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2276.68s)]
*  Yeah, exactly right. [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2278.8399999999997s)]
*  I it's so funny to me that, you know, here's this man formerly of the Times, [[00:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2279.8399999999997s)]
*  formerly BuzzFeed looking at me, you know, the lady anchor, like, wouldn't it be [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2284.68s)]
*  better for you if somebody were able to control you so you didn't get, you know, [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2289.2799999999997s)]
*  go off the rails so much? [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2293.2s)]
*  And I, of course, I was like, no, I mean, just the implication of it. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2294.68s)]
*  Like, I'm not responsible for what I say. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2298.92s)]
*  And I wish someone could come into this show and put the bridle on. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2300.7200000000003s)]
*  Poor Steve Krakauer just isn't able to do it. [[00:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2305.96s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2308.68s)]
*  It's ridiculous. [[00:38:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2310.32s)]
*  That's not how it's ever worked, frankly, between me and my producers. [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2311.7200000000003s)]
*  Though at Fox, I understood there were guardrails in terms of how to behave on [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2314.68s)]
*  cable news. So here he pivots from that Trump speech I gave the night before the [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2318.32s)]
*  election into this. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2323.84s)]
*  This is where he takes it. [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2325.48s)]
*  Satu. [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2326.28s)]
*  I mean, I think your audience probably I would guess mostly voted for Trump, but I [[00:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2330.0s)]
*  know lots of people who watch you and didn't. [[00:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2333.6400000000003s)]
*  Do you worry that they can't trust you that as you cover him going forward that [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2335.6400000000003s)]
*  they'll kind of think you're in the tank? [[00:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2338.92s)]
*  No, not at all. [[00:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2340.4s)]
*  I mean, our numbers are huge. [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2341.6000000000004s)]
*  You know, I know you just had CNN on in January last month on their YouTube feed. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2343.2400000000002s)]
*  They got one hundred and fifty five million views and we were one hundred and [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2350.24s)]
*  forty seven million. [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2354.96s)]
*  Just me. [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2356.96s)]
*  Is your cost structure slightly lower? [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2357.56s)]
*  Exactly. Well, I'm just saying that's one show. [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2359.72s)]
*  The Megyn Kelly show. Just me and my six producers versus every single show on [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2361.64s)]
*  CNN, every single thing they put on YouTube. [[00:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2365.52s)]
*  I was within six or seven million of them. [[00:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2367.8799999999997s)]
*  The month of the election, November, I beat them. [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2370.9199999999996s)]
*  I beat all of them. [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2373.3199999999997s)]
*  By the way, I beat NBC. [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2374.48s)]
*  I beat CBS. All of them regularly. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2375.56s)]
*  The Sky News. November. [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2377.04s)]
*  I beat them all. All of them. [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2378.52s)]
*  ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, all of them. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2379.96s)]
*  So I'm not having a trust issue. [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2382.64s)]
*  Right. He's he's suggesting people aren't going to trust you. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2386.88s)]
*  They're going to think you're in the tank. [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2389.28s)]
*  Like, aren't you a hack now because you spoke for Trump? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2391.04s)]
*  And again, this is why I say like he doesn't watch the show. [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2394.16s)]
*  He doesn't understand what we do. [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2396.7200000000003s)]
*  Everybody listening to the show right now knows I do criticize Trump and his [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2398.04s)]
*  administration plenty. [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2403.2s)]
*  I mean, just look at our show yesterday where we opened up this before I sat with [[00:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2404.84s)]
*  him talking about how I I did not agree with what they were doing on the press [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2408.04s)]
*  pool. Right. Like Trump didn't speak to me for the better part of late 23, early [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2412.16s)]
*  24, because he was angry about that interview he gave me or I pressed him on [[00:40:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2417.0s)]
*  some of the lawfare questions. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2421.08s)]
*  It's not pleasant. [[00:40:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2422.72s)]
*  It's not pleasant to be on the wrong side of the president. [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2423.96s)]
*  I like him. So I want him to like me. [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2426.36s)]
*  But my job and my integrity is more important to me. [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2428.56s)]
*  But all these questions were geared toward you've sold your soul. [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2431.36s)]
*  You've become a hack. [[00:40:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2434.44s)]
*  You just do things to get patted on the head by the president and YouTube views. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2435.64s)]
*  Yeah. And that's a that's the other thing I thought was interesting from that [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2441.28s)]
*  question is that, again, like we spent the first part of the show talking about how [[00:40:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2444.36s)]
*  the White House screwed up yesterday. [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2448.08s)]
*  I mean, you don't need to. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2449.56s)]
*  It's not like you have to like miss one episode and then you're out of the loop. [[00:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2450.84s)]
*  Like you do this all the time. [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2454.48s)]
*  That's why people like you and trust you. [[00:40:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2455.68s)]
*  So it's actually part of the trust. [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2457.28s)]
*  Part of the trust is built into you being like, yeah, I think people should vote for [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2459.8s)]
*  Donald Trump. Here is why. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2464.28s)]
*  And then you can assess my coverage of Trump's policies. [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2466.32s)]
*  You can assess my coverage of Kamala Harris's proposals through that lens. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2469.84s)]
*  It's actually like his question is completely missing the point. [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2473.8s)]
*  It's a difference between owning your bias and then proceeding accordingly, trying to [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2477.84s)]
*  do the best you can as a fair commentator and journalist or just pretending it doesn't [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2482.2400000000002s)]
*  exist and then leaning into your bias because you want to express it through the news [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2486.0800000000004s)]
*  coverage, which you are pretending is fair and objective. [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2489.8s)]
*  Right. It's like. [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2493.1200000000003s)]
*  This way, I tell you what I'm rooting for, that I try to give you fair coverage and [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2494.16s)]
*  anything I say that's opinion, you know, is from that perspective. [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2498.4s)]
*  What the mainstream does, so-called, is they don't own any of their bias. [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2501.44s)]
*  They claim they have none and they just manifest it through their alleged fact [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2504.7999999999997s)]
*  reporting, which is just so pernicious. [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2509.16s)]
*  I mean, that's why they're failing. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2511.88s)]
*  Here here was the capper. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2513.88s)]
*  Right. So we get to the question about Tucker Carlson. [[00:41:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2515.68s)]
*  Years ago, Tucker was doxxed. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2520.48s)]
*  These hateful leftist groups showed up at his home in Washington, D.C., where his wife [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2522.28s)]
*  was alone. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2527.56s)]
*  I think one of his children may have been home as well. [[00:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2529.08s)]
*  I can't remember right now, but for sure, Tucker wasn't there and his wife was in [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2531.68s)]
*  there and scared. [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2535.52s)]
*  They were angry and they were chanting and they were getting all in his lawn. [[00:42:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2537.16s)]
*  He was he had been doxxed and now his wife was threatened. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2540.64s)]
*  And Ben Smith actually tried to compare my comments the other day about Rachel [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2544.12s)]
*  Maddow's sanctimony to that. [[00:42:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2549.92s)]
*  Watch this. Years ago, protesters went to Tucker Carlson's home. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2553.08s)]
*  I think you probably both remember vividly. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2557.92s)]
*  You called it at the time stomach turning and said it has to stop. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2560.2000000000003s)]
*  But it's funny, I was talking to another broadcaster the other night and she said, [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2563.2400000000002s)]
*  you know, one thing Megan does that is most of us don't do is go after other people [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2566.6800000000003s)]
*  in media really personally, like there's sort of a gentleman's agreement in a lot [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2571.32s)]
*  of media to not attack each other personally. [[00:42:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2574.36s)]
*  And that I don't know if I don't know if you think that's true as a broadcast. [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2577.36s)]
*  Why don't you do it? [[00:42:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2579.8s)]
*  Do you Google Megan Kelly, NBC and tell me whether the journalists don't go after [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2580.48s)]
*  each other personally. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2586.2400000000002s)]
*  You recently talked about Maddow's public complaints and sort of said, you know, [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2586.8s)]
*  said that she should put up or shut up basically, but also about her expensive real [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2589.6400000000003s)]
*  estate about her homes. [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2593.84s)]
*  And I'm curious, like, do you have any compunction about getting that personal? [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2595.36s)]
*  No, I would never give out her address. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2599.0s)]
*  That would be a bridge too far. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2601.7200000000003s)]
*  And it doesn't compare to what happened to Tucker in any way, shape or form. [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2603.12s)]
*  But Rachel Maddow got out there and tried to act like, oh, I'm, I'm a woman of the [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2606.64s)]
*  working class. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2611.04s)]
*  I'm here to represent the poor staffers who could lose their jobs now as a result [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2611.8399999999997s)]
*  of Joy Reid biting it. [[00:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2615.48s)]
*  And meanwhile, she's collecting $25 million a year. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2617.0s)]
*  She's got multiple homes worth millions. [[00:43:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2619.48s)]
*  You know what? [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2621.56s)]
*  Why don't you take a $2 million pay cut and save 10 of those jobs? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2622.04s)]
*  If you feel that said, you don't even have to pay it out of your pay, out of your [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2624.8399999999997s)]
*  bank account, just tell them, pay me 23 million next year instead of 25. [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2627.3599999999997s)]
*  She won't do it. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2632.92s)]
*  She wants to seem virtuous and sanctimonious, but in fact, she's only the [[00:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2633.88s)]
*  latter because she won't actually put any money on the line. [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2637.28s)]
*  And an example of the exorbitant life she leads while she's trying to remind us, [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2639.36s)]
*  oh, I've worked so many jobs, the jobs I've worked puts to the point her hypocrisy. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2643.8s)]
*  What'd you make of that one, Emily? [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2651.1200000000003s)]
*  Incredible. [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2653.28s)]
*  I mean, the way that Tucker ended up getting all of these insane protests is that [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2654.1600000000003s)]
*  people were actually doxing him and they were encouraging protests outside of his [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2658.76s)]
*  home to make him uncomfortable is the point of the protest. [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2663.16s)]
*  So it was, I mean, that question is grossly, grossly unfair. [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2665.96s)]
*  And also I think baked into it was that hilarious assertion laundered through this [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2669.3599999999997s)]
*  broadcast person that apparently said, you know, it's just very unusual to go [[00:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2673.64s)]
*  after people it's like, no, no, it's unusual for libs to go after other libs. [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2677.64s)]
*  Like, yes, the rich liberals do not go after the rich liberals, but they will [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2682.8399999999997s)]
*  absolutely take shots at people that are not, you know, coot in their book club [[00:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2686.12s)]
*  circles on the upper East side. [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2691.2799999999997s)]
*  Like give me a freaking break. [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2693.2s)]
*  What are you talking about? [[00:44:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2694.48s)]
*  They don't go after each other. [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2695.92s)]
*  If it's another liberal, that's exactly right. [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2696.96s)]
*  But if you're a conservative, you've been fair game for a long time, which again, [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2698.2799999999997s)]
*  Ben Smith does not understand. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2701.52s)]
*  But just as a refresher, my team did put together a few examples of people [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2703.68s)]
*  violating the gentleman's agreement about which we know nothing. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2709.0s)]
*  And I've been in cable news for 20 years. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2713.2s)]
*  Here it is. [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2715.24s)]
*  Black Santa truther, Megan Kelly. [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2716.04s)]
*  There's more from Megan Kelly, who seems to be sometimes the world's angriest [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2718.4s)]
*  multimillionaire. [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2722.04s)]
*  I mean, look, it works for her podcast, you know, magnifying minorities, [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2723.12s)]
*  picking up on fringe issues. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2727.96s)]
*  Megan Kelly, the black face expert, the Jesus and Santa are white lady is not [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2729.68s)]
*  going to crawl her way back to social relevance. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2733.92s)]
*  She owes a bigger apology to folks of color around the country. [[00:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2736.04s)]
*  That's silly. [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2741.8s)]
*  And it's disingenuous. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2742.6s)]
*  And it's, it's, it's just as ignorant and racist as the statement itself. [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2743.6s)]
*  She said something stupid. [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2746.8s)]
*  She said something indefensible. [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2747.92s)]
*  This is Kremlin propagandist Tucker Carlson. [[00:45:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2749.32s)]
*  The image he was portraying on Fox, it's, I would actually argue it's un-American. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2751.6400000000003s)]
*  It's a darkened heart. [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2755.7200000000003s)]
*  That's what it is. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2757.44s)]
*  Comes from a, that comes from a darkened heart. [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2759.0s)]
*  The idea of Tucker Carlson being in that mob that day and not wetting [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2761.4s)]
*  his pants is hard to imagine. [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2766.76s)]
*  I think Tucker Carlson gives a lot of air time to hate for the LGBTQ community. [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2768.6400000000003s)]
*  He is heinous. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2774.6800000000003s)]
*  He is vulgar. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2775.4s)]
*  He's atrocious. [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2776.12s)]
*  The stuff Tucker and Laura Ingraham say every night, it could be [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2776.92s)]
*  written by white supremacists. [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2780.44s)]
*  And there is a section of this manifesto where the shooter starts talking about. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2781.8399999999997s)]
*  People always say diversity is strength. [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2785.3199999999997s)]
*  I can hear it in Tucker's voice. [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2787.0s)]
*  He says this all the time, right? [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2788.8399999999997s)]
*  But the Ben Shapiros of the world say that. [[00:46:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2790.44s)]
*  To our most prominent white nationalists, he arguably has done more on cable [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2792.16s)]
*  television to spread the gospel of hate, fear, and paranoia than anyone since [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2796.6s)]

*  The most racist show in the history of cable news. [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2812.84s)]
*  It's weird how I didn't get the memo on the gentleman's agreement that Ben Smith [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2818.6s)]

*  No, I mean, the time they'll do it when somebody like transgresses the boundaries [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2842.2s)]

*  So I mean, just you're like the worst person to ask that question because it's [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2858.84s)]
*  so obvious that the question is premised on something insane. [[00:47:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2864.84s)]
*  Well, it's funny because he said, you know, she said there's a gentleman's [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2869.48s)]
*  agreement and I laughed and said, why don't you try Googling Megan Kelly, NBC [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2872.5600000000004s)]
*  and say, and he had no interest in following up. [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2875.88s)]
*  And the other thing was he said, I said, the relationship between me and my [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2877.76s)]
*  audience is authentic and it's tight. [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2881.4s)]

*  I will correct myself. [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2888.8s)]
*  And he said, well, have you like what? [[00:48:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2889.8s)]
*  And I said, well, like I was way too believing of the COVID vaccines and the [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2891.5600000000004s)]

*  it. And I was dead wrong. [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2901.6400000000003s)]
*  And I've owned that with my and he moved on. [[00:48:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2903.2400000000002s)]
*  You couldn't have gotten off of that faster. [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2906.6000000000004s)]
*  He was like, oh, shit, that's not what I was hoping you were going to say. [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2909.0800000000004s)]
*  It was like, I was hoping you'd say something that would be pleasing to me and [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2911.76s)]
*  not this in my audience here. [[00:48:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2915.6000000000004s)]
*  Now, that's annoying because like Ben is, I think, one of the smarter people in [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2917.96s)]
*  media and he can be really interesting. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2921.3199999999997s)]

*  Well, I still like Ben Smith, and I believe that if I were to sit with him [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=2928.96s)]

*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3169.92s)]
*  You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3172.88s)]
*  You're gambling with World War Three. [[00:52:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3175.44s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country. [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3178.48s)]
*  OMG. [[00:53:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3186.84s)]
*  Zelensky said this right before those exchanges. [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3188.28s)]
*  We signed a deal with Putin. [[00:53:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3191.76s)]
*  He did not keep it. [[00:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3193.96s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy are you talking about? [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3195.2400000000002s)]
*  Saying that, you know, President Trump's attempts to solve this diplomatically [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3198.4s)]
*  aren't going to work, and you can see that did not go over well with either of [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3201.8s)]
*  the two men he really could use on his side. [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3207.64s)]
*  Just so the audience knows, you were born in Russia. [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3212.4s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3215.88s)]
*  And you're from Belarus. [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3216.2000000000003s)]
*  But it was the Soviet Union. [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3217.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3219.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3219.96s)]
*  So I mean, you understand this region of the world a bit. [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3220.16s)]
*  What did you see there? [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3223.64s)]
*  I feel like a child of divorce. [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3224.6s)]
*  This brings me right back to like my parents feuding in our living room. [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3226.64s)]
*  I don't really get Zelensky. [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3233.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't have a good theory of mind for him outside of him being an actor. [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3234.76s)]
*  And he always acts like he's like in a Liam Neeson or Tom Cruise action film. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3237.96s)]
*  He seems kind of uppity and entitled when people are trying to extend an olive branch. [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3243.2400000000002s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3249.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3249.92s)]
*  I mean, he's been doing his like begging for money tour for years. [[00:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3250.44s)]
*  Oh, no, you're good. [[00:54:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3255.8399999999997s)]
*  You got it. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3258.44s)]
*  So, yeah, he seems frustrated. [[00:54:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3260.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3262.48s)]
*  But it just when I look at that, I'm like, why would you do anything other than be [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3263.3199999999997s)]
*  magnanimous and frankly, like, suck up to President Trump, who's got the deepest [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3268.52s)]
*  pockets of anybody who's helped him and could help him and is very interested in [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3276.52s)]
*  striking a deal to wrap this thing up now, whether he likes the terms or not, that [[00:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3282.44s)]
*  that can all be negotiated. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3285.84s)]
*  But why put him in an angry mood while you're in the oval? [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3286.76s)]
*  He hasn't read the art of the deal. [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3291.76s)]
*  He doesn't know how to strike it. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3293.88s)]
*  Does he think that the money will dry up if he plays nice with Trump because he's so [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3295.92s)]
*  used to receiving large us from like the Biden administration and establishment [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3303.44s)]
*  Democrats like, is that the reasoning there? [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3308.16s)]
*  I have no idea. [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3310.2000000000003s)]
*  I assume so. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3311.08s)]
*  And there's a new sheriff in town. [[00:55:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3311.8s)]
*  Like he's got this is the man right there. [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3313.04s)]
*  That man with the crazy blonde hair needs to like you, needs to believe in you. [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3315.32s)]
*  And we'll play more as we get it. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3320.7200000000003s)]
*  But this is absolutely foolhardy of Zelensky. [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3323.12s)]
*  You get invited to the Oval Office. [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3326.68s)]
*  There's really only one posture you can take. [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3328.08s)]
*  You maintain your dignity. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3329.96s)]
*  Of course. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3331.04s)]
*  Yes, as a foreign leader, you're entitled to do that on behalf of your people. [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3331.56s)]
*  But he shouldn't be groveling as Trump says he's not in a good position. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3335.56s)]
*  He has a very low approval rating. [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3339.16s)]
*  People are not a fan of this war. [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3341.04s)]
*  That I mean, we've been saying is it's obvious, I think, is it proxy war? [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3343.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3347.96s)]
*  And he's saying you're going to get us into World War Three. [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3348.7599999999998s)]
*  You want World War Three. [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3350.68s)]
*  Trump's saying that he's not wrong. [[00:55:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3351.44s)]
*  I mean, Russia has nukes. [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3353.12s)]
*  This is one of the reasons why people over here have been so concerned about the [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3354.7599999999998s)]
*  increasing aid we've been giving, the increasing weaponry we've been giving. [[00:55:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3359.2s)]
*  We do not want a nuclear war with Russia at all, especially over Ukraine and whether [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3363.04s)]
*  it's going to join NATO or have this slice of territory, it's or Russians. [[00:56:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3367.8399999999997s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3372.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3372.3999999999996s)]
*  I mean, I was surprised by how contentious this exchange is. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3372.68s)]
*  It almost feels staged or something. [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3375.48s)]
*  I mean, I assume it's not, but I'm sure you guys are familiar with like the Marco [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3377.16s)]
*  Rubio comments recently. [[00:56:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3380.56s)]
*  He's been doing a pretty good job. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3382.16s)]
*  And he was talking about how historically when they tried to negotiate with Zelensky, [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3383.92s)]
*  he kind of meets them halfway and accepts some of their terms and then goes back and [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3389.7999999999997s)]
*  blabs to the media that like, no, I rejected this decision or this treaty unilaterally. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3394.3599999999997s)]
*  Which is what just happened on this minerals deal where Marco, you know, they never [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3400.3599999999997s)]
*  have the presidents meet directly before they've had the diplomats meet directly. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3404.56s)]
*  And the diplomats are supposed to strike the deal. [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3407.64s)]
*  And only when the deal is struck do you then put the leaders together so they can just [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3409.44s)]
*  look like, yay, we're winners. [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3412.64s)]
*  Look what we did. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3414.04s)]
*  So Rubio said he met with his counterpart in Ukraine and that they reached a deal [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3414.8399999999997s)]
*  on the rare mineral earth materials that they were going to start giving us some [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3418.96s)]
*  portion of them to pay us back for all of our investment there and also to keep us [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3423.96s)]
*  economically invested in the harvesting of those minerals on a go forward basis, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3429.12s)]
*  which Trump sees as a security guarantee for Ukraine. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3432.84s)]
*  If we're over there, our economic interests are over there mining these minerals. [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3435.48s)]
*  Putin, his theory is, will be less likely to invade again or do anything to upset [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3439.48s)]
*  Ukraine. So that's where they got Marco Rubio said it publicly. [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3443.76s)]
*  Zelensky suddenly said there's no deal. [[00:57:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3446.92s)]
*  Rubio comes out and says this guy constantly does this. [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3448.68s)]
*  You know, like we did have a deal. [[00:57:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3451.2400000000002s)]
*  Now he's saying no. [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3453.2400000000002s)]
*  Then the news came. [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3455.16s)]
*  Yes, there is a deal. [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3456.6s)]
*  And Zelensky comes to the Oval and apparently uses it as an opportunity to tell [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3458.32s)]
*  Trump once again, he can't trust Putin. [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3463.08s)]
*  I mean, this is just dumb. [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3466.12s)]
*  This is dumb diplomacy on his part. [[00:57:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3467.12s)]
*  But here's another soundbite we just got. [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3468.88s)]
*  It is Trump telling Zelensky we gave him three hundred and fifty billion dollars of [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3471.44s)]
*  our money. Watch. [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3476.04s)]
*  Your country is in big trouble. [[00:57:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3477.52s)]
*  Can I answer? [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3479.1200000000003s)]
*  No, no, you've done a lot of talking. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3479.84s)]
*  Your country is in big trouble. [[00:58:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3481.6s)]
*  I know. You're not winning. [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3483.48s)]
*  You're not winning this. [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3485.1200000000003s)]
*  I you have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of the president. [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3486.1200000000003s)]
*  We are staying in our country, staying strong from the very beginning of the war. [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3490.6s)]
*  We've been alone and we are thankful. [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3494.6s)]
*  I said thanks. You haven't been in this cabinet. [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3496.6800000000003s)]
*  You haven't been alone. [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3498.8s)]
*  We gave you the stupid president three hundred and fifty billion dollars. [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3499.92s)]
*  You gave me your military equipment. [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3504.36s)]
*  You met a brave, but they had to use our military. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3506.8799999999997s)]
*  What about this? [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3509.56s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment, you invited me. [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3510.3599999999997s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3513.16s)]
*  He's not wrong. [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3520.3599999999997s)]
*  This did not go well, ladies. [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3522.6s)]
*  Listen to this. Here's some reaction. [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3524.56s)]
*  Of course, the New York Times, Peter Baker, who hates Trump with the passion of [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3526.8399999999997s)]
*  ten thousand sons, tweets out, never has an American president lectured the [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3530.44s)]
*  leader of an ally in public like this, much less the leader of a country that is [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3534.92s)]
*  fighting off invaders. Well, what if a leader attacks the president and doesn't [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3539.4s)]
*  appreciate the amount of money that's been invested by his country, Peter? [[00:59:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3543.36s)]
*  The New York Times report, Zelensky flashed a thumbs up as reporters were escorted [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3547.92s)]
*  out of the Oval asking my own team. [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3552.56s)]
*  Do they escort reporters out before the meeting was over? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3555.56s)]
*  Is that what happened? Do we know? [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3557.92s)]
*  All right, that's what we think happened. [[00:59:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3565.64s)]
*  Perhaps they were continuing the meeting in private. [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3567.0s)]
*  Peter's wife, Susan Glasser, of The New Yorker, who is horrid. [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3569.88s)]
*  I can't see enough bad things about this person, tweets out, this is the most [[00:59:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3575.44s)]
*  shocking behavior by Trump and Vance I've ever seen in the Oval. [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3579.52s)]
*  An ambush. [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3583.48s)]
*  Well, we'll have to go back and watch it from the beginning. [[00:59:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3584.96s)]
*  Tommy Victor, who's a former Obama guy and also a troll, one of the co-hosts of [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3586.88s)]
*  Pod Save America. [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3592.44s)]
*  These fucking assholes lecture and condescend to Zelensky and then fluff [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3594.04s)]
*  Putin at every possible opportunity. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3598.84s)]
*  Absolutely disgraceful. [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3600.6s)]
*  This is going to be talked about for a very long time. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3602.12s)]
*  We're witnessing a very important moment right now. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3604.08s)]
*  What do you make? I mean, I think if Peter Baker is against it, we're for it. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3607.6s)]
*  Sure. I mean, I want the war to end. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3610.8s)]
*  That's how I feel. [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3613.32s)]
*  And I don't think it would have started if Trump had been in office. [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3614.08s)]
*  OK, sorry. Say again. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3617.96s)]
*  Say again, Steve. [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3619.96s)]
*  Oh, God. What? [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3622.76s)]
*  There's a press conference that's going to start. [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3624.56s)]
*  Oh, wow. I don't like my chances on how well that's going to go. [[01:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3627.36s)]
*  Yeah. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3630.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't know. I'm distressed by this because we were close to getting this thing done. [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3632.2000000000003s)]
*  Like nobody else was close to getting it. [[01:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3637.28s)]
*  And it's not going to end in a way that Ukrainians are going to like. [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3639.08s)]
*  That's just the truth. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3641.96s)]
*  What happened was we were looking at forever stalemate and escalating war. [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3643.12s)]
*  Or this, where at least we stop the losses. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3647.4s)]
*  We come to some sort of agreement in Ukraine where we're at least there [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3650.6000000000004s)]
*  economically, which I agree with Trump would be somewhat of a deterrent to Putin. [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3653.6800000000003s)]
*  But the other side that wants a better deal is not wrong, that [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3657.92s)]
*  it feels like surrender and that Putin is going to get to keep the territory. [[01:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3662.7200000000003s)]
*  Well, you know, war. [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3666.48s)]
*  Yeah, that's the thing. [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3667.5600000000004s)]
*  It's like the terms. Yeah. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3668.6000000000004s)]
*  Didn't work out. It wasn't winnable. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3670.48s)]
*  Yeah. And Zelensky almost feels like a patsy who was elected to facilitate [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3672.1600000000003s)]
*  a tremendous loss for Ukraine. [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3678.48s)]
*  And he's wildly unpopular. [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3681.0800000000004s)]
*  He doesn't want to lose or he doesn't want to stop the war. [[01:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3682.28s)]
*  No, I feel like. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3685.6000000000004s)]
*  Do you guys talk to, you know, people in the Eastern European community? [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3686.5200000000004s)]
*  Do you have a feel on how people are taking this whole saga? [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3690.84s)]
*  Mm hmm. [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3695.6000000000004s)]
*  I mean, I think in New York City, like the Russians and Ukrainians [[01:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3697.0s)]
*  and Belarusians that you meet tend to be on the liberal side. [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3701.0800000000004s)]
*  So they're pretty vehemently anti-Putin and pro-Ukraine, [[01:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3703.84s)]
*  whether or not they like Zelensky personally. [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3707.32s)]
*  Yeah. So it's not like an exactly unbiased sample of people. [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3710.6400000000003s)]
*  I just don't talk about it. Yeah. [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3715.1600000000003s)]
*  With my parents. [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3716.92s)]
*  Are your parents more pros? Oh, yeah. [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3718.1200000000003s)]
*  And you guys are not that pro Zelensky now [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3721.0400000000004s)]
*  for the same reasons as we've been discussing. [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3724.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3726.48s)]
*  That the war has been to me seemed very corrupt. [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3727.6000000000004s)]
*  But how do you see through it? [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3731.2400000000002s)]
*  How did you manage to like see that as opposed to, you know, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3732.36s)]
*  it's like with that influence around you, with people you love and trust [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3735.52s)]
*  from the region? [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3737.96s)]
*  Mm hmm. I mean, I guess I remember, obviously, [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3739.92s)]
*  like Putin is responsible for his actions when the war started. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3743.84s)]
*  There was a whole narrative about whether or not he was crazy. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3747.88s)]
*  And to me, he didn't it didn't seem crazy to not want NATO on your border [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3751.32s)]
*  and that he was sort of provoked into starting the war. [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3754.72s)]
*  Mm hmm. Which doesn't. [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3758.48s)]
*  Not crazy. I don't think he's crazy. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3759.8s)]
*  And he's a rational actor. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3761.36s)]
*  I've said before, too, and this is controversial, [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3762.64s)]
*  but I actually don't think he's evil either, which I know is also controversial. [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3764.56s)]
*  Yeah. But I just think if. [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3769.2799999999997s)]
*  In Putin's head, this is all very rational that he's got to protect Mother Russia. [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3770.88s)]
*  He can't have NATO on his borders and he will do what he thinks is necessary [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3777.04s)]
*  to protect his country and its long term existence. [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3781.2799999999997s)]
*  And also the hope of restoring Mother Russia to her former glory. [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3784.16s)]
*  Yeah. Now, I guess you could use that same rationale to say, well, [[01:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3787.84s)]
*  Hitler wasn't evil either because he believed he was doing the right thing. [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3790.68s)]
*  But I do think Putin is a rational actor who can be negotiated. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3793.16s)]
*  And that's kind of what Trump has been saying, which is like this war [[01:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3797.12s)]
*  never should have started. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3800.24s)]
*  The whole NATO discussion shouldn't have gone on. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3801.3999999999996s)]
*  And frankly, the US shouldn't have been meddling over there from 2014 forward. [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3804.2799999999997s)]
*  And I don't think NATO wants Ukraine. Yeah. [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3808.08s)]
*  It's they certainly don't want to back them now. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3811.16s)]
*  Yeah. So I guess Zelensky is going to keep forcing the issue. [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3814.44s)]
*  I mean, I think traditionally Russians are who live in the West [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3818.44s)]
*  or like so against the old communist system. [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3822.04s)]
*  And I think maybe they view Putin as an extension of that sort of authoritarianism. [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3825.24s)]
*  And they can't kind of [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3830.8s)]
*  get around that or accept that the world is different now. [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3833.64s)]
*  So that's probably part of their reaction. [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3837.72s)]
*  I would love to go back and we will. [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3840.72s)]
*  You'll see this all weekend and you'll see it here on the show on Monday. [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3842.56s)]
*  To start like what what was the beginning? [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3845.48s)]
*  What set it off? [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3847.96s)]
*  How did things start to unravel? [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3849.64s)]
*  And how did it start to go downhill? [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3852.04s)]
*  This is going to dominate. [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3854.0s)]
*  This feels like a very large news event and more on this as we get it, [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3855.6s)]
*  as we get more soundbites to I'll play them for you. [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3859.84s)]
*  All right. Let's move on to other more lighthearted. [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3862.28s)]
*  Let's get some softball. [[01:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3865.24s)]
*  I know. Actually, you guys were great people to have here. [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3866.52s)]
*  Given everything that's happening, it's not like Israel and Hamas, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3870.6s)]
*  but like you have some connection. Sure. [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3874.0s)]
*  All right. So but it is a Friday. [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3876.8s)]
*  We do like to discuss some lighter cultural fair on Fridays if we can. [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3878.2s)]
*  And that brings me to Ashley St. [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3881.4399999999996s)]
*  Claire. Now, I look that was one of the other things that I had with Ben [[01:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3884.04s)]
*  Smith when I went to his conference in D.C. yesterday. [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3889.04s)]
*  He was upset that I, quote, attacked Ashley St. [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3891.72s)]
*  Claire, that I went after her. That's what he said. Uh huh. [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3895.68s)]
*  And he was acting like I was bullying her in some way. [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3899.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, I never would have mentioned the name of Ashley St. [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3902.24s)]
*  Claire. She was not on my radar. [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3904.7599999999998s)]
*  I I've never attacked Elon's other baby mamas. [[01:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3906.3199999999997s)]
*  I don't care if like these women want to strike that deal with Elon. [[01:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3910.28s)]
*  It's none of my business. [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3912.92s)]
*  I get on if it works for everybody. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3913.88s)]
*  The difference with this woman is she knew completely what she was walking into. [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3916.4s)]
*  And then when the benefit of that bargain came exactly as one could [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3921.6800000000003s)]
*  predict it would come, which is no meaningful relationship with him, [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3926.96s)]
*  no Valentine's Day together, she got upset, sent out a nasty tweet, [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3930.6400000000003s)]
*  claimed a tabloid was doing an in-depth investigation on her, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3936.2400000000002s)]
*  which never broke. [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3939.4s)]
*  The only one who ever reported on this was the New York Post [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3940.36s)]
*  because she gave them a photo shoot inside the lavish apartment [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3943.44s)]
*  with feet pics and incorrectly arranged chessboard. [[01:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3947.84s)]
*  Oh, I didn't notice that. Really? Yeah. [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3951.84s)]
*  Are you a chess player? She is. Oh, my God. [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3953.4s)]
*  People were. Yeah, there it is. [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3957.1600000000003s)]
*  Yeah. Here are the feet, the naked feet with their floor to ceiling windows [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3958.88s)]
*  in an apartment almost certainly funded by him. Yeah. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3961.84s)]
*  I think we'll see. There we go. [[01:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3964.88s)]
*  He kept her in isolation. [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3965.92s)]
*  Yeah, the Knights and the bishops are need to be swapped. [[01:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3969.44s)]
*  But I'm impressed. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3972.44s)]
*  Well, that's a true chess player to see that in the photo. [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3974.08s)]
*  So what do you make of the fact that now she, you know, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3978.4s)]
*  she she wants us to feel sorry for her. That's that's what I believe. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3981.44s)]
*  She's sad about her, the consequences of her own life choices. And [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3984.1600000000003s)]
*  she definitely doesn't want publicity. [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3988.2000000000003s)]
*  Do not believe the pictures of her in the corset in the New York Post. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3989.88s)]
*  Doesn't want it. [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3993.44s)]
*  Yeah, she's wearing like a dark Lauren Sanchez look where it's like [[01:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3994.6800000000003s)]
*  the Lauren Sanchez inauguration fit, but all black. Yeah. [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=3997.88s)]
*  No, I said this on our podcast when we covered this topic. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4002.4s)]
*  Like sometimes I feel personally sort of undignified [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4005.96s)]
*  when we like post selfies or show our meme coin. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4010.12s)]
*  And then there's like these influencers out there on social media [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4013.96s)]
*  doing like Maury Povich paternity stuff. It's crazy. [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4017.8s)]
*  So now she has sued Elon. [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4021.92s)]
*  That's in the news today for paternity. Yeah. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4023.32s)]
*  And accuses him of going dark on her. [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4026.64s)]
*  And Elon tweeted out something to the effect of [[01:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4029.2s)]
*  I have taken care of every child I've ever fathered. [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4032.48s)]
*  And generously, if ever there's been a breakdown, [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4036.2s)]
*  it's because the demands have been exorbitant. [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4039.6s)]
*  So he didn't name her. [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4042.28s)]
*  But it seemed to be a clear reference to trust me. [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4043.84s)]
*  I'm going to take care of every child. I sire. [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4046.28s)]
*  But I'm not going to be made a fool of. [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4049.12s)]
*  Yeah. And start giving out billions to 26 year olds [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4052.04s)]
*  who I slept with once in St. [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4055.7999999999997s)]
*  Bart's, which appears to be what happened here. [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4057.36s)]
*  We were sort of speculating on whether they actually like knocked boots [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4060.16s)]
*  or if it was an IVF baby, because he has a record of that. [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4063.92s)]
*  Not really my business and don't care. [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4066.84s)]
*  But yeah, people have dug up like old correspondences, texts of hers. [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4068.44s)]
*  She and she or she screen capped. [[01:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4073.08s)]
*  Yeah, because they were disappearing. [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4075.84s)]
*  She was ready to bed him. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4078.6s)]
*  I'm not I'm not that scandalized by that, because, you know, we women [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4081.2s)]
*  say all sorts of crazy things when we have our eyes on a guy. [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4084.56s)]
*  Yes, I wish he would knock me up. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4087.6s)]
*  That's not that outrageous. [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4089.2799999999997s)]
*  I've never said that. I have. [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4090.84s)]
*  But I think just her conduct leading up to it, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4095.2s)]
*  that she like leaked this herself on Valentine's Day, [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4098.48s)]
*  that it was kind of like a pre choreographed, [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4103.16s)]
*  almost Instagram like post versus a tweet, that it had the name [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4106.68s)]
*  and email of her publicist who does crisis management and damage control [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4110.32s)]
*  for celebrities. [[01:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4114.759999999999s)]
*  She claims that she was isolated in her home, that she wasn't able to take a walk [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4116.5599999999995s)]
*  with her baby, she that her five month old baby has never been out for a walk. [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4120.719999999999s)]
*  As if someone was recognized as Ashley Sinclair. [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4124.599999999999s)]
*  Exactly. At all. [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4128.16s)]
*  Especially prior. Right. [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4129.799999999999s)]
*  Like she was nobody. Right. [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4131.36s)]
*  Why would anybody care? [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4133.16s)]
*  That's what was bothering her. Exactly. [[01:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4134.799999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's what that was the problem. [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4136.759999999999s)]
*  So the tweets to which you refer, [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4138.32s)]
*  she had an exchange with another online influencer [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4141.24s)]
*  where she was talking about [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4144.639999999999s)]
*  how she really wanted to have Elon's baby. [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4147.32s)]
*  I need his rocket babies. [[01:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4149.2s)]
*  Lol. [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4151.04s)]
*  He 10,000 percent saw my moon landing tweet. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4152.36s)]
*  Then she writes to her friend, look, I'll take one for the team, seduce Elon [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4157.16s)]
*  and get in a rocket to see what's up. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4160.84s)]
*  Then she also said, I need a caption to seduce Elon Musk. [[01:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4163.36s)]
*  Thinking about the dangers of AI laughing emoji. [[01:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4166.879999999999s)]
*  Elon replied to the thread revealing that because it was the person [[01:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4170.679999999999s)]
*  with whom she was texting posted the private DM exchange on Twitter [[01:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4174.12s)]
*  and made it public and Elon responded, whoa, [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4179.08s)]
*  which I don't know what that means, because literally, Elon, I have news for you. [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4182.36s)]
*  Every woman you're sleeping with is doing it for the same reason. [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4184.799999999999s)]
*  Baby trapping. [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4187.959999999999s)]
*  Yeah, that's right. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4189.04s)]
*  Like they're thinking they're going to get a private jet out of it. [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4189.879999999999s)]
*  That's probably a problem for most billionaires in dating newbies. [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4192.64s)]
*  But it sounds like he's on board with that to some like I'm sure the [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4196.84s)]
*  Ashley Sinclair is taking care of. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4200.76s)]
*  Yes. In every regard, besides the amount of attention that she is getting. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4202.68s)]
*  Yeah, which is not really up to him. [[01:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4206.120000000001s)]
*  Right. Kind of her job in life to make her own opportunities for attention. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4207.96s)]
*  She can't count on him for that. [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4212.72s)]
*  Yeah, I I also want to point out that, like when people say, like, well, [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4215.120000000001s)]
*  it's understandable why she entered into this bizarre and unpleasant arrangement [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4219.24s)]
*  because, you know, it's she's set for life and think of the genes and so on. [[01:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4224.32s)]
*  We were talking about this on the podcast. [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4230.2s)]
*  Like, I I don't think that it it doesn't seem that like fun or worthwhile [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4231.92s)]
*  or healthy to be chained to the world's richest man financially, [[01:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4237.16s)]
*  especially when you guys don't get along and he doesn't like you. [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4240.8s)]
*  Right. I will punish you because you overstepped. [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4245.5199999999995s)]
*  And then the genetic argument is bizarre, too, because even if your kid has, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4248.72s)]
*  like the most maximized genes and the highest IQ, he's already kind of screwed [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4252.68s)]
*  because there have been idiots like squabbling on the Internet about him [[01:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4257.72s)]
*  since before he gained sentience. [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4261.56s)]
*  Yeah, I'd much rather have a child with a regular IQ and a father in the picture. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4264.04s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4267.84s)]
*  I I don't know this person, but my strong belief is [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4269.04s)]
*  this wasn't about having a baby with a high IQ. [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4272.16s)]
*  She wanted to be taken care of for the rest of her life. Yeah. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4274.0s)]
*  She already had a baby from another man. [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4276.16s)]
*  Then she hooks up with Elon, which was clearly her goal. [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4278.32s)]
*  OK, fine. Oh, it's fine. [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4281.5199999999995s)]
*  I actually know people who are gold diggers. [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4283.2s)]
*  And it's like, that's a choice. [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4285.36s)]
*  You know, if you're like a beautiful woman [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4287.28s)]
*  and you have a lot of rich men who want to like, I'm so valid. [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4289.16s)]
*  I don't really have a problem with it, to be honest with you. [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4292.32s)]
*  I do have a problem with you then playing the victim. Right. [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4295.2s)]
*  And wanting me to feel sorry for you when he's with somebody else on Valentine's Day. [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4298.28s)]
*  And when you're at your lavish New York City apartment, isn't quite lavish enough. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4303.4s)]
*  Yeah. And I also just feel like I just do desperately want to remind young women, [[01:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4307.44s)]
*  you don't have to go this way. [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4313.5599999999995s)]
*  You can make your own money and still wind up with somebody great. [[01:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4314.919999999999s)]
*  It is a possibility. [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4319.919999999999s)]
*  Mm hmm. Well, I just have to start a podcast. [[01:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4321.12s)]
*  They say in New York, you can have a good relationship, [[01:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4323.36s)]
*  a livable apartment or a good career, but you can only have two of those three. [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4326.48s)]
*  I deny that. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4330.12s)]
*  I know you think, yeah, but you're very we saw your tweet. [[01:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4333.04s)]
*  Yeah. When I started at Fox, I think my first job at Fox was one hundred and fifteen [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4336.48s)]
*  thousand dollars a year. [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4342.44s)]
*  Trying to remember, because we negotiated like a no, no, it was. [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4343.88s)]
*  Yeah. They wanted to pay me under one hundred. [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4347.2s)]
*  And I said, there's no way I'm taking on under one hundred with ten years of law practice under my belt. [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4348.92s)]
*  I refuse just on principle. [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4352.88s)]
*  So I got it right over one hundred cameras, like one hundred and five or one hundred and ten. [[01:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4354.84s)]
*  I can't remember. [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4357.32s)]
*  My point is now that's that's a good salary for sure. [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4358.32s)]
*  But I wasn't rich and I had to live in Manhattan. [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4361.08s)]
*  Right. It was like I had to be at work at five in the morning. [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4364.72s)]
*  First, D.C. and then Manhattan. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4368.280000000001s)]
*  My point is, yeah, I have money now, but I did not always have money. [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4369.56s)]
*  I really didn't. And my first job in TV only paid 17 grand a year. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4372.88s)]
*  But if you love what you do, you put in endless hours. [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4377.04s)]
*  It's a labor of love. [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4380.52s)]
*  And usually, if you're a hard worker, you will do well in the profession of your choice. [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4381.92s)]
*  She was making it. She had a million followers on X. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4387.320000000001s)]
*  Well, now I wonder now you're both making the same face. [[01:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4390.6s)]
*  I do wonder how she got the followers. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4393.72s)]
*  I mean, she's like a influencer. [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4395.48s)]
*  Yeah, right. Sort of already prostitute adjacent. [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4399.32s)]
*  You mean there are influencers who are not prostitutes. [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4404.2s)]
*  She is not one of them. Yeah. [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4406.639999999999s)]
*  You know, she's in the she was in that conservative men's calendar. [[01:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4408.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. Right. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4413.0s)]
*  A couple years ago, she has like a sorted online history as sex laptop. [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4413.92s)]
*  This allegedly. Oh, I don't know. [[01:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4418.96s)]
*  These are things that I like absolutely don't judge her for. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4421.12s)]
*  I don't care. Right. Whatever to each his own. [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4424.24s)]
*  As I said, I wouldn't have known again who she was had she not. [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4426.72s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. So anyway. [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4430.32s)]
*  OK, that's enough of Ashley St. [[01:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4431.8s)]
*  Claire. I think we're done with her. [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4433.16s)]
*  Now, the Oscars are this weekend. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4434.64s)]
*  Are you guys going to watch that? I guess. Yeah. [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4436.64s)]
*  You're an actress. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4439.28s)]
*  I mean, I don't always watch the Oscars, but Conan O'Brien's hosting. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4440.24s)]
*  He's funny. I enjoy him. [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4443.72s)]
*  Our viewers may or may not remember that Dasha is a successful actress [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4446.0s)]
*  who starred in, among other things, succession. [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4450.28s)]
*  Yeah. Everybody's favorite. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4452.599999999999s)]
*  Did you happen to read the profile in New York magazine on the Murdochs? [[01:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4454.28s)]
*  It hit on the paper version this past weekend and hit [[01:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4459.4s)]
*  in the online version a week or so earlier. [[01:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4462.24s)]
*  You might find it interesting. [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4464.88s)]
*  They went back and found all the actual court filings in this hideous fight [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4466.08s)]
*  that's going on between Lachlan and Rupert on the one side and James and Liz [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4470.32s)]
*  and Prudence Rup Murdoch on the other side. [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4475.12s)]
*  And there was this whole big hearing out in Reno, Nevada, [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4479.0s)]
*  on what's going to happen with his trust. [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4482.24s)]
*  And they got all the transcripts. [[01:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4483.599999999999s)]
*  So you're seeing the actual testimony of the actual Murdochs. [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4485.5199999999995s)]
*  And what's how you might find it really starting that series. [[01:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4488.08s)]
*  But OK, so I used to watch the Oscars religiously and I look forward [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4491.919999999999s)]
*  to the fashion and just to see who the winners were. [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4495.32s)]
*  And it was a time when there weren't 15 nominees for best actor and best picture. [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4498.04s)]
*  And when you've seen all the movies. Yeah. [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4503.679999999999s)]
*  Now, I was looking at the list. [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4506.24s)]
*  I think I've seen one like I saw Conclave. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4508.400000000001s)]
*  That's all I've seen. [[01:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4512.2s)]
*  I don't even recognize the names of the others. [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4513.04s)]
*  Yeah. And the ceremony itself has changed and they're wokeified [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4514.92s)]
*  and they're annoying. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4518.2s)]
*  And this Amelia Perez seems to be the favorite to win everything, [[01:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4519.24s)]
*  which is about some very manly tranny. [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4521.76s)]
*  Like I don't know. [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4525.68s)]
*  What are we rooting for? [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4528.4400000000005s)]
*  Has anyone seen Amelia Perez? [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4530.16s)]
*  I'm really curious. [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4531.96s)]
*  No, because I can't tell if it's like a spoof or what. [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4533.68s)]
*  People are mad that it's not like. [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4536.56s)]
*  It doesn't actually offer like a like a [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4539.6s)]
*  and there's not enough woke ideology in it. [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4542.400000000001s)]
*  I guess. OK, that sounds promising. [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4544.8s)]
*  We have a clip. If you haven't seen the clip, you must. [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4546.68s)]
*  I think we may have seen the clip. [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4549.240000000001s)]
*  There's a bit. [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4550.6s)]
*  From penis to vagina. [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4563.88s)]
*  For me? [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4570.240000000001s)]
*  No. [[01:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4571.72s)]
*  Yes. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4593.76s)]
*  What is that? [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4601.12s)]
*  Adam's Apple reduction. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4602.04s)]
*  Yes, yes, yes. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4604.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, is there something in these martinis or did that happen? [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4608.4400000000005s)]
*  That's that's that was that's one of the best picture nominees [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4612.4800000000005s)]
*  and it's the favorite. [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4616.0s)]
*  Well, it's a musical. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4617.160000000001s)]
*  I'm willing to give it, you know, I want to give it a shot. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4618.360000000001s)]
*  I think it could have some merit, you know. [[01:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4621.0s)]
*  Here's why it's not going to win. [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4624.84s)]
*  Mm hmm. Mm hmm. [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4626.76s)]
*  The lead trans trans person. [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4628.04s)]
*  Is controversial, was tweeting out a bunch of stuff [[01:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4632.04s)]
*  that does not make Hollywood happy. No. [[01:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4635.48s)]
*  OK, Carla Sofia Gascon. [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4638.88s)]
*  Who is a man pretending to be a woman [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4642.8s)]
*  has got a bunch of tweets out there that criticize, like, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4647.0s)]
*  George Floyd. [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4650.8s)]
*  Hold on. Let me get it. [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4652.96s)]
*  Yeah, I'm trying to find it. [[01:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4654.52s)]
*  The Oscar ceremony itself. [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4656.04s)]
*  Islam is becoming a hotbed of infection for humanity. [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4657.92s)]
*  And that urgently needs to be cured. [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4661.280000000001s)]
*  Then about Selena Gomez, his costar. [[01:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4663.84s)]
*  She's a rich rat. [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4667.04s)]
*  He's the poor bastard whenever she can and will never stop bothering [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4669.080000000001s)]
*  her ex-boyfriend, Justin Bieber and his wife. [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4672.8s)]
*  OK, there's more. [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4675.120000000001s)]
*  Attached to a photo of a Muslim family, he saw at a restaurant, [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4678.12s)]
*  including a woman in a burka, tweeted, Islam is marvelous without any machismo. [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4681.16s)]
*  Women are respected. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4686.84s)]
*  And when they are so respected, they are left with a little squared hole [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4688.24s)]
*  on their faces for for their eyes to be visible on their mouths. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4691.72s)]
*  But only if she behaves, although they dress this way for their own enjoyment. [[01:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4695.76s)]
*  How deeply disgusting of humanity. [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4699.68s)]
*  And here's the last one. [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4702.48s)]
*  There are more, but the last one I'll read here. [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4704.08s)]
*  I really think that very few people ever cared about George Floyd [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4706.28s)]
*  to a drug addicted swindler, but his death has served to once again [[01:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4709.679999999999s)]
*  demonstrate that there are people who still consider black people to be monkeys [[01:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4714.08s)]
*  without rights and consider policemen to be assassins. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4719.12s)]
*  They're all wrong. [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4723.88s)]
*  And it goes on from there. [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4725.36s)]
*  So what does that do to Amelia Perez's chances? [[01:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4726.28s)]
*  Well, didn't they kind of drop her from the press? [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4730.28s)]
*  The Netflix is going to attend the Oscars. [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4735.599999999999s)]
*  Yeah. But I actually think concrete is going to win [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4738.719999999999s)]
*  because Pope Francis is on his deathbed. [[01:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4741.599999999999s)]
*  Yes. So people become more interested in people on. [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4744.2s)]
*  And they they definitely want to suggest there will be an intersect. [[01:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4747.8s)]
*  Hope. Yes. [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4751.24s)]
*  I'm deaf in the Catholic Church. [[01:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4752.04s)]
*  That's what we're hoping for. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4754.599999999999s)]
*  Like you want to know, so black woman for the papacy. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4755.84s)]
*  It's about time. Sure. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4759.36s)]
*  I kind of low key love the harlis. [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4761.6s)]
*  So for you, I guess they're pretty moderate and pretty on point. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4764.200000000001s)]
*  Welcome to our side. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4768.76s)]
*  I know. [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4770.320000000001s)]
*  No, no disrespect to George Floyd, because we have the same music taste. [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4772.360000000001s)]
*  And I can relate to him not knowing how to boil water. [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4776.04s)]
*  But she's right that this person was kind of sanctified, [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4778.200000000001s)]
*  not for the stated reasons, which is that people were locked down due to Covid [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4784.04s)]
*  and were mourning the loss of their own lives, not his lives. [[01:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4788.080000000001s)]
*  They wanted to get out and protest because they were angry [[01:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4791.24s)]
*  about everything being shut down. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4794.04s)]
*  Well, it is funny because some of those are more incendiary. [[01:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4795.96s)]
*  But the vast majority suggests that this person is really a conservative [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4798.679999999999s)]
*  and doesn't go along with these identity politics, [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4803.32s)]
*  which makes the whole transition even more bizarre. [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4805.8s)]
*  But I mean, we've got Caitlyn Jenner, who's not into identity politics either [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4809.28s)]
*  and has done the so-called transition. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4813.639999999999s)]
*  So I like I do think he's being treated the same way. [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4816.84s)]
*  Anyone who had been outed as a conservative would be treated. [[01:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4820.08s)]
*  Which is with horror. [[01:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4823.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. But it's crazy. [[01:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4824.4400000000005s)]
*  Yeah. But he's nominated for best actress. [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4827.280000000001s)]
*  I know. Yeah. Just think about the sentence I just said. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4829.8s)]
*  I know. I know. I was thinking about this. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4832.24s)]
*  I wonder what your guys' take is on this, because it doesn't seem to be [[01:20:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4834.88s)]
*  the same thing as like [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4839.52s)]
*  men competing in women's sports, where they have a distinct [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4841.72s)]
*  like physical biological advantage. [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4844.2s)]
*  This seems kind of more nebulous, but it is also kind of awkward [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4846.32s)]
*  and weird to have a person who is a biological male compete in the best act. [[01:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4850.0s)]
*  I don't think he's got any advantage. [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4854.04s)]
*  It is kind of funny. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4856.2s)]
*  Like there have been some of the sports where I'm like, where is there [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4857.639999999999s)]
*  a natural male advantage, like pool billiards? [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4860.2s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. That was one where the women were like, no, we don't want the men here. [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4864.48s)]
*  I'm like, is that one where? [[01:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4868.2s)]
*  But I think the things the complaint was they say yes. [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4870.44s)]
*  Chess. Yeah. [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4873.92s)]
*  Why? Well, why? [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4875.76s)]
*  Why is chess separated? [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4877.04s)]
*  Well, men are, you know, smarter. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4878.88s)]
*  What? Not in like, you know, just in terms of strategic thinking, [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4882.08s)]
*  the kind of thinking that chess is, that there's a reason. [[01:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4885.76s)]
*  Is that true? [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4888.08s)]
*  I mean, there's a reason like all the grandmasters are men. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4888.88s)]
*  I mean, one does have. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4892.360000000001s)]
*  There are really good female chess players. [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4893.2s)]
*  Yeah. Like you're not saying net net. [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4895.16s)]
*  They're smarter. [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4896.64s)]
*  You're certain areas of thinking in like the excellent outliers of [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4897.24s)]
*  like competitive sports. [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4901.88s)]
*  And when it comes to directions. [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4903.28s)]
*  I guess, yeah, that's definitely another one. [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4905.679999999999s)]
*  And then we have the advantage over them when it comes to certain other things [[01:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4908.28s)]
*  like how to organize one's life. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4911.32s)]
*  Yes. And discipline. [[01:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4913.48s)]
*  Yes. With a soft hand. [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4915.28s)]
*  Exactly. Yeah. [[01:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4917.76s)]
*  But I think I love this story. [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4919.88s)]
*  I just learned about it today and on the way here in the car. [[01:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4922.2s)]
*  And I just I love when the kind of elites like woke [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4925.599999999999s)]
*  politics come back to bite them in the ass [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4930.28s)]
*  because they'll foreground, like showcase these people with like [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4934.44s)]
*  alternative identities. [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4938.84s)]
*  And then it turns out that they don't always like fall in line or fit the bill. [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4940.44s)]
*  And they claim to like respect identity. [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4944.08s)]
*  But what they really want is to people to they demand conformity, you know. [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4946.08s)]
*  And you can be like gay, black, trans, disabled, whatever. [[01:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4950.88s)]
*  If you err conservative views, [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4955.2s)]
*  you are suddenly exiled from like the progressive stack. [[01:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4958.360000000001s)]
*  Ask Caitlyn Jenner. Yeah. Ask Clarence Thomas. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4962.68s)]
*  Yeah. Carol Swain was on the program last week, professor of all the elite [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4966.84s)]
*  universities. But as soon as she started to think more heterodox [[01:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4971.4400000000005s)]
*  and more heterodox way, especially on race, she was kicked out of the squad. [[01:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4975.12s)]
*  Doesn't matter. Black woman. [[01:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4979.04s)]
*  They loved it. No. [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4981.0s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard. [[01:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4982.360000000001s)]
*  She was like the next rising star on the Democratic Party. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4983.320000000001s)]
*  She's like she's not white. [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4986.08s)]
*  She's like she's got a lot of firsts behind her. [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4989.0s)]
*  Yeah. When it comes to her religion and so on and a woman. [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4992.24s)]
*  But she backed Bernie instead of Hillary. [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4995.0s)]
*  She had to be taken out. [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4998.0s)]
*  Then she said a bunch of stuff about the Democrat Party not being fair. [[01:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=4999.400000000001s)]
*  Her career was over. [[01:23:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5003.04s)]
*  And with the Academy, I mean, a couple of years ago, [[01:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5004.360000000001s)]
*  I think it was after Ellen DeGeneres was canceled. [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5006.6s)]
*  She got mean to. [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5009.4400000000005s)]
*  I enjoyed that one. [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5013.04s)]
*  But they couldn't even find someone to host. [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5014.04s)]
*  It was either the Oscars or the Golden Globes. [[01:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5016.16s)]
*  But like there wasn't anyone that they could even find because they couldn't. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5018.28s)]
*  There wasn't anyone who's never said anything nonproblematic. [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5021.48s)]
*  Right. And who wants someone who's never said anything nonproblematic? [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5024.6s)]
*  In the arts? Come on. [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5028.64s)]
*  Boring. Yeah. [[01:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5030.08s)]
*  And it like it stands to reason that [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5031.32s)]
*  if you're the type of person who would change your entire gender identity, [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5034.0s)]
*  you probably have other problematic things going on in your life. [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5037.92s)]
*  Good point. A simple Google search might have. [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5041.96s)]
*  Yeah. Serve them well prior to that nomination. [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5043.88s)]
*  I don't think that this person is going to win the best actress. [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5047.12s)]
*  And that's a good thing for the other reasons. [[01:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5052.04s)]
*  All right. Now, wait more from the Zelensky meeting. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5054.400000000001s)]
*  Fox just reported that the Zelensky Trump presser is now canceled. [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5056.4400000000005s)]
*  Oh, wow. What a shock. [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5061.12s)]
*  A statement from President Donald J. [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5063.96s)]
*  Trump, quote, We had a very meaningful meeting in the White House today. [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5065.32s)]
*  Much was learned that could never be understood without conversation [[01:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5068.88s)]
*  under such fire and pressure. [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5071.76s)]
*  It's amazing what comes out through emotion. [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5073.36s)]
*  And I have determined that President Zelensky is not ready for peace. [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5075.96s)]
*  If America is involved, oh, God, because he feels our involvement [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5078.96s)]
*  gives him a big advantage in negotiations. [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5083.759999999999s)]
*  I don't want advantage. I want peace. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5088.12s)]
*  He disrespected the United States of America in its cherished Oval Office. [[01:24:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5091.04s)]
*  He can come back when he is ready for peace. [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5095.88s)]
*  Oh, my God. [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5098.44s)]
*  Damn, this did not go well. [[01:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5101.04s)]
*  I can think of another guy who disrespected [[01:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5103.88s)]
*  the United States of America in the cherished Oval Office. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5106.64s)]
*  Bill Clinton. Yeah. Yeah. [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5110.44s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5112.84s)]
*  Well, that's in the news now, too, which is the first word on that Zelensky thing. [[01:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5113.64s)]
*  He will come back. [[01:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5117.44s)]
*  I predict he will come back to the Oval Office and he will come back on bended knee [[01:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5118.24s)]
*  because there's no resolving that war without us. [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5121.76s)]
*  Yes, he will come back and he will grovel. [[01:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5124.04s)]
*  There is no resolving that war without us. [[01:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5126.76s)]
*  No, I mean, we started. We started. [[01:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5129.24s)]
*  We're paying for it. [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5131.32s)]
*  If we just pull all of our support, it's it's over. [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5132.2s)]
*  Russia will take Ukraine. [[01:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5134.8s)]
*  Yeah. Europe can't do it without Russia. [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5136.88s)]
*  Vance said, yeah, they don't even have. [[01:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5138.36s)]
*  I mean, they've lost. [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5139.84s)]
*  They've had so many casualties there, like it. Right. [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5140.84s)]
*  Inscripting people to see what is he's trying to foster a closeness [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5143.599999999999s)]
*  between Putin and Trump and more so like. [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5147.88s)]
*  Yeah. As soon as we pull our support, it's over for him. [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5150.76s)]
*  Yeah. And he can't go in there and play tough guy Zelensky. [[01:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5153.36s)]
*  And of course, this is the all. [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5156.32s)]
*  Yeah. Because then Russia takes it all. [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5159.16s)]
*  But I I almost think it would be funny for America to rage, [[01:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5162.5599999999995s)]

*  Here it is. I've never done the ads after a martini. [[01:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5450.240000000001s)]

*  There's panic with some people willing to say or do anything [[01:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5460.0s)]
*  if they think it will help their side when there's so much uncertainty, [[01:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5463.360000000001s)]
*  which explains why so many people. [[01:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5466.400000000001s)]

*  Yeah. And then ultimately, my husband Doug had to step in [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5507.92s)]
*  because he and I drank an eggnog in Christmas. [[01:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5512.08s)]
*  And when I tried to do the same thing, he had to step in and read the last ad for me. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5515.2s)]
*  So you're not a big drinker. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5522.12s)]
*  I mean, I kind of I guess I'm not. [[01:32:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5524.04s)]
*  I thought I could hold my liquor, but I don't usually have something like this. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5526.28s)]

*  There are too many people who say stuff that you've heard everywhere else. [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5562.16s)]
*  And so, well, like you, you don't deliver it with all sorts of [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5565.96s)]

*  This is more year round. This is better. [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5593.04s)]
*  You should stick to this instead of the Kamala Harris. [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5594.84s)]
*  You did better here. [[01:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5596.76s)]
*  And here is OK, here's she asked her a good question. [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5599.52s)]
*  What is the name of the sex podcaster? [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5605.76s)]
*  Alex Cooper. Thank you. [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5607.72s)]
*  Thank you. Forgive me. [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5609.56s)]
*  She asked Monica a question that I don't think she's gotten asked before. [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5611.72s)]
*  And that's saying something about the Clinton scandal, [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5615.84s)]
*  which was what would you have liked him to do when the whole scandal broke? [[01:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5618.6s)]
*  That is a good question. That is it, right? [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5623.64s)]
*  So I think we have that queued up. Let's watch it. [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5625.28s)]
*  Saw 39. I think that the right way to handle [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5627.56s)]
*  a situation like that would have been to probably say it was, [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5633.2s)]
*  you know, nobody's business and to resign, you know, or to find a way [[01:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5638.32s)]
*  to find a way of staying in office that was not lying and not [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5644.839999999999s)]
*  throwing a young person who was just starting out in the world under the bus. [[01:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5652.32s)]
*  And at the same time, I'm hearing myself say that. [[01:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5657.12s)]
*  And it's like, OK, but we're we're also talking about [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5659.5199999999995s)]
*  the the most powerful office in the world. [[01:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5665.759999999999s)]
*  You know, so I don't I don't want to be naive either. [[01:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5669.839999999999s)]
*  Interesting. [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5675.36s)]
*  Did they fix up the set to look more presidential? [[01:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5676.36s)]
*  I am not sure what was going right. [[01:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5679.719999999999s)]
*  Did it cost one hundred thousand dollars? [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5681.719999999999s)]
*  Didn't look like the common. [[01:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5683.5199999999995s)]
*  Why didn't the budget go into her pants? [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5684.5599999999995s)]
*  I have no issue with those black and white, black and red checkered trousers. [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5687.2s)]
*  And it's an issue. [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5691.92s)]
*  But I don't hate him. I think she looks good. [[01:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5693.08s)]
*  You don't hate him. She looks amazing. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5695.08s)]
*  She looks better than she did as she pointed out when the scandal. [[01:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5696.759999999999s)]
*  I think we all look better than we looked in the night. [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5700.839999999999s)]
*  True. I mean, you know, I have to say she does, too. [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5702.48s)]
*  It's fine. There's zero way a chance a president would ever resign. [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5708.12s)]
*  You know, in the wake of a scandal. [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5712.24s)]
*  But I am of two minds, like I'm really torn about Monica Lewinsky because [[01:35:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5714.32s)]
*  Clinton is a douchebag in many ways. [[01:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5718.4s)]
*  That's clear. Yeah. [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5720.679999999999s)]
*  He definitely metude her, you know, with the power imbalance and all that. Sure. [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5721.959999999999s)]
*  She really took a beating in the public eye, a severe beating in the public eye. [[01:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5727.08s)]
*  And she was very young. [[01:35:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5730.76s)]
*  But on the other hand, she made the choices she made when you're 22. [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5732.8s)]
*  You you have knowledge about the risks of young. [[01:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5735.96s)]
*  She wasn't, you know. [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5739.240000000001s)]
*  Yeah. So what do you how do you see it? [[01:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5740.56s)]
*  He was clearly attracted to his power, [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5741.6s)]
*  and she was flattered by the fact that he took a liking to her [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5745.04s)]
*  as the leader of the free world, like, I guess, who wouldn't be? [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5748.240000000001s)]
*  The one thing I can say that really, I guess, redpilled me against feminism [[01:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5754.76s)]
*  was the reaction of mainstream establishment feminists to Monica Lewinsky. [[01:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5758.8s)]
*  Like Gloria Steinem, all the bigwigs, they kind of got in line and were like, [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5763.88s)]
*  she's a slut, she's a whore. [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5768.2s)]
*  Because they had to protect him. [[01:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5770.52s)]
*  Yeah, because they because they're Democrats before they're feminists. [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5771.4800000000005s)]
*  Exactly. And I remember, you know, being like, wait, this isn't right. [[01:36:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5774.72s)]
*  This doesn't make sense. [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5781.6s)]
*  This isn't consistent with your stated ideology. [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5782.64s)]
*  But now she has like she's on a kind of redemption. [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5786.76s)]
*  She went on to call her daddy to promote her own podcast, which is called Lord. [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5789.56s)]
*  It's called what is it called? It's like, don't worry about it. [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5794.64s)]
*  There's not a single listener who will be tuning in to the show. [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5797.72s)]
*  But it's called. Yeah, I think it's reclaiming and she's reclaiming her narrative. [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5801.72s)]
*  And she did a whole movie about that. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5805.72s)]
*  Yeah, exactly. She's it's been reclaimed. [[01:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5807.6s)]
*  She's an interesting case study in how things have shifted from like now [[01:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5811.2s)]
*  nowadays we would never slut shame someone in her position. [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5815.64s)]
*  I mean, I might I might you might not going to lie. [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5819.96s)]
*  I might do we might. But the the society at large would not. [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5823.08s)]
*  That is what you see. [[01:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5827.160000000001s)]
*  Those leftist feminists, a hallowed victim. Yeah. [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5828.280000000001s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I don't like I have. [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5830.8s)]
*  I really feel like she needs to move on. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5833.320000000001s)]
*  Definitely. That's sad. [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5835.320000000001s)]
*  Sick and tired of hearing about this. [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5837.0s)]
*  If you're going to launch a podcast, go for it. [[01:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5839.240000000001s)]
*  But it's like this is her only thing. [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5840.4800000000005s)]
*  What has she done since then other than she writes for Vanity Fair? [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5841.68s)]
*  Great. OK, that's fine. [[01:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5844.599999999999s)]
*  But then you should be talking about the columns that you write [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5846.08s)]
*  and whatever your accomplishments have been since 1995 when or whatever it was for. [[01:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5848.2s)]
*  When I sat in the Barnes and Noble of the World Trade Center [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5854.32s)]
*  and read the Ken Starr report as a young aspiring lawyer, [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5860.48s)]
*  or I just started practicing law, I can't remember which. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5864.719999999999s)]
*  But I must have just graduated from law school because I was in law school. [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5866.88s)]
*  Whatever. It doesn't matter. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5870.32s)]
*  The point is, that's how long it's been. [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5871.08s)]
*  And she's still out there talking about her blowjobs with Bill Clinton. [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5874.0s)]
*  It's too much. It's sad. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5878.0s)]
*  I mean, but that's the real takeaway from all of these type of me to scandals. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5879.96s)]
*  I mean, she when she was going through, it wasn't me two times yet. [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5884.12s)]
*  But there is like a reluctance and inability to just move on, move past. [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5889.48s)]
*  And their identities are forever tethered to this dramatic episode. [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5893.88s)]
*  And they have to re traumatize themselves over and over. [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5897.8s)]
*  And really, it's like it starts to feel after a while kind of cynical [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5901.320000000001s)]
*  because it's clearly like a ploy to promote their own work, their own content. [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5905.12s)]
*  Yes, it's like she at this point, she should be saying, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5908.88s)]
*  I've said all there is to say on that subject. [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5913.4800000000005s)]
*  Like, we're good. Let's let's talk about something else. [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5915.6s)]
*  Because I'm sure that interview did talk about her new show and whatever. [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5917.72s)]
*  No one cares. [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5921.360000000001s)]
*  The only reason they care about her is because of that scandal, [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5922.12s)]
*  which is why I probably if I were Monica Lewinsky, [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5925.04s)]
*  would have chosen a life in the private sector. [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5927.84s)]
*  Just make doing some good. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5930.04s)]
*  Yeah, you can do some you can achieve other things. [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5931.72s)]
*  She could be like Pamela Anderson. [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5934.32s)]
*  She could stop wearing makeup and do a photo. [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5935.68s)]
*  She's feelings on that one, too. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5938.52s)]
*  Me too. I have overwhelmingly negative feelings as a Pam lover. [[01:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5939.96s)]
*  But how do you feel about the Vakes naked feet in whatever interview he just gave? [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5943.64s)]
*  Don't make me say anything racist on a mainstream. [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5948.4800000000005s)]
*  Well, how is it racist? [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5951.12s)]
*  You have racist thoughts on it. Kind of a guru. [[01:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5952.52s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5954.84s)]
*  Kind of not a skiving, a simulated. [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5956.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, it doesn't look very governory. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5958.56s)]
*  No, it makes him look vulnerable. [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5960.96s)]
*  You should never Achilles heel. [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5963.4800000000005s)]
*  You should never show your feet as a man or your Achilles heel. [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5965.0s)]
*  And as a woman, you should never show them for free. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5967.84s)]
*  Never show my feet for free. [[01:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5972.96s)]
*  Only on OnlyFans. [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5974.6s)]
*  Mm hmm. Or, yeah, you can make a lot of money showing your feet. [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5976.0s)]
*  A lot of money. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5980.12s)]
*  I bet people would love to see the soles of your feet. [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5981.16s)]
*  I mean, they'd be horrified. [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5983.2s)]
*  My toes are like my fingers, super long. [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5984.8s)]
*  It's very weird. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5987.72s)]
*  I got to go. [[01:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5989.8s)]
*  It's a pleasure, ladies. Thank you. [[01:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5991.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jpoXPXOJ8C4&t=5992.72s)]
