Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Jason Calacanis and Chamath Palihapitiya, co-hosts of the All-In Podcast, to discuss the evolution of Donald Trump and the entire political and cultural landscape, why "Trump 2.0" is attracting independents and moderates, why the left abandoned their principles and allowed an opening for Trump, the imminent need for DOGE to get to work, how Pete Hegseth is helping fix the military, how technology supremacy is key to both military and economic dominance, how bureaucratic red tape has stalled innovation, the truth behind Fox Corporation and the Megyn Kelly Show, what the acquisition of Red Seat Ventures by Fox means for the show, why independent media is so important, why independent media is thriving while legacy media is dying, how Big Tech algorithms shape and censor content, VP JD Vance’s warning to Europe about their self-inflicted problems, their decline on the world stage, the recent bizarre meltdown from Kara Swisher and Scott Galloway, their desperate attempts to stay relevant by bashing Elon Musk and DOGE, and more.

# Power of Trump 2.0, Why Elon and DOGE are Working, & Independent Media's Impact, w/ Jason & Chamath
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 14, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Happy Valentine's Day and happy Friday. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=0.0s)]
*  And nothing says love like inviting on your show one of your frenemies. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6.8s)]
*  No, he's not a friend. I'm just kidding. But you guys may remember Jason Calacanis of the All In [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  podcast. And I have a kind of special relationship. It goes all the way back to his first and only [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=17.92s)]
*  appearance on our show. It was about almost, what, three years ago? June of 2022, episode 337, [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=24.08s)]
*  when I ended up calling him a prick. That's not nice. But our relationship has really evolved. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=31.36s)]
*  I actually really like him. And I think we've put our differences in the past, though we'll find out [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=38.24s)]
*  today, including spending some time together at the All In Summit last September. I'll just give [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=44.08s)]
*  you a little memory lane before we bring him on along with his co-host Chamath, because you may [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=51.36s)]
*  remember this funny exchange. It got a lot of attention. Here's the longer one when he was on [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=58.24s)]
*  the show three years ago. What I'm trying to dispute is the attempt to now say we've got to [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=63.28s)]
*  get guns because of all the mass shootings. The mass shootings are what justify our newfound push [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=68.8s)]
*  on quote gun control. And what it is to me is a dodge on the rising crime rates, which have been [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=74.8s)]
*  a drag on the Democratic ticket and are going to take them down come the midterm elections in [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=80.72s)]
*  October. It's gaslighting. So how many people do need to die in a mass shooting for it to be? [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=84.64s)]
*  Why don't you answer my question? Since you're here as the guest. What was the question? Was [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=88.8s)]
*  there a question? Yeah, I thought we were here. I think you're conflating a lot of different issues [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=91.92s)]
*  in a very partisan way to get ratings. That's bullshit. Don't question my motives. This is [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=96.88s)]
*  where you turn into sort of an asshole. You asked me what I think. That's what I said. That's what [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=102.56s)]
*  I think. What you said that there's... I'm giving you my honest analysis. And for you to say that I [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=105.52s)]
*  am misleading the audience for ratings is a prick thing to say. You don't know me. All right. I've [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=109.44s)]
*  made my name and I've made my business based on honest journalism. I realize you may be number [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=114.32s)]
*  26 worldwide, but you've never done real journalism at the level I have. So that's how our first [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=118.72s)]
*  meeting went. That's just good fun. And then he was gracious enough to have me at the All In Summit [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=125.75999999999999s)]
*  along with Chamath and of course, David Sacks, who's the other person in that, if you're watching [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=134.72s)]
*  on YouTube, you'll see who's part of that show as well. And now he's working for the Trump [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=139.76s)]
*  administration. David is. But in any event, those guys all had me out to the All In Summit last [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=143.52s)]
*  September, which was really fun and enlightening. The guests were amazing. I really enjoyed myself. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=148.24s)]
*  And Jason got a lot of guff for the exchange I'm about to show you, but I saw it very differently. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=155.12s)]
*  I did not think he deserved all the guff he got because he knew I was a lawyer. He knew that I [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=160.56s)]
*  knew what I was talking about. I think he was being a generous host. I think he was trying [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=169.84s)]
*  to let me show some of my knowledge on this case. And people were like, he's an idiot. People on [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=174.8s)]
*  the right, they didn't like him. But I think they misunderstood that he was actually being generous [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=180.56s)]
*  to me. Here's the exchange that literally went everywhere. We look at the five cases, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=184.64000000000001s)]
*  six months from now, a year from now. Let's assume all five of them go to trial. He's guilty of three [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=189.76s)]
*  so far. What do you mean he's guilty of three so far? He's been convicted of three. Sorry. What do [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=194.32s)]
*  you mean? No, he hasn't. I love this. No, E. Jean Carroll was guilty. That was not a conviction. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=198.56s)]
*  That was a civil case. Well, yes, that's what I'm talking about. So that one is- Okay, but there's [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=205.35999999999999s)]
*  a big difference. Yeah, and the Trump organization, they're guilty there. Okay, and the CFO. Civil, liable, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=208.64s)]
*  liable. Yes, of course. But these are the cases we're talking about. And then the third one- [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=214.23999999999998s)]
*  You know she's the lawyer, right? Yeah. You said three convictions. Now you're walking it back. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=218.32s)]
*  I'm not walking it back. There's three in which he was- You should walk it back. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=222.4s)]
*  Okay, guys. Of the five, three of them, he's either guilty or- He got a bad result. Yeah, [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=225.51999999999998s)]
*  got a bad result. There are two more. If he is found guilty of those two more, will you chalk [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=231.6s)]
*  all five up in your mind to five different jurisdictions, five different prosecutors, [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  five different juries and or judges, all conspiring to get him? 100%. Okay. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=242.0s)]
*  All right, and then I went on to list why and that went to a lot of places on the internet. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=249.68s)]
*  But here's the interesting thing. My impression is, and we're going to ask him in two seconds, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=254.16s)]
*  that Jason has gone full-on MAGA. I mean, he is like ready to move in with Steve Bannon. They [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=259.52s)]
*  seem very tight. No, he just seems very pro-Trump and it's been an evolution. You know, [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=266.72s)]
*  it's been an evolution for me too. It's been an evolution for a lot of people, but that's perfect [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=272.24s)]
*  because his bestie, David Sacks, is now the crypto czar in the Trump administration. So joining me [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=276.16s)]
*  today for the very first time, well, second time since all of that is Jason. And then also for the [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=282.0s)]
*  first time is Jason's co-host on the hit tech podcast All In, Chamath Palihapatia. First time [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=287.52000000000004s)]
*  here. Chamath is one of those evil billionaires the Democrats are always warning us about, [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=295.6s)]
*  but he's a self-made billionaire having started his career out many years ago at Burger King, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=299.04s)]
*  which we are told is a good thing that you were supposed to celebrate unless you actually do [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=305.44s)]
*  parlay it into true billionaireship, in which case you're bad. In addition to All In, Chamath [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=309.36s)]

*  Oh, thanks for having us, Megan. Look at this. This walk through memory lane and you inviting [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=395.12s)]
*  me on Valentine's Day. Stop. It's too much. I mean, it's so great to be here. Well, the good [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=400.16s)]
*  news is, you know, you said we were 27. Now we're top 10 right up there with you, Megan, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=408.16s)]
*  right up there in the top 10 of the ratings with you. And, you know, I think the Trump, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=412.8s)]
*  just to get right to it, you know, great respect for you as a broadcaster, obviously. And I love [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=419.68s)]
*  having challenging conversations. The Trump lawfare one was a great one. And I think, you know, [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=425.84000000000003s)]
*  if we look at Trump 2.0 versus Trump 1.0, it's pretty clear he's put a different group of people [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=432.96s)]
*  around him. And you evoke the name Steve Bannon, you know, like comparing the team he has now to [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=438.47999999999996s)]
*  that team. Those guys were kind of losers, I'll be totally honest and xenophobic. And I don't agree [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=444.79999999999995s)]
*  with a lot of the Trump 1.0 agenda. But if the Trump 2.0 agenda is let's have less government, [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  balance the budget, free speech and stop wars. I'm here for it. So Trump has evolved massively. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=455.91999999999996s)]
*  His positions are completely different this time around. And I always want to support the president, [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=461.84s)]
*  whoever wins. I'm not a partisan guy. I'm actually an independent. I voted Republican about a third [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=467.28s)]
*  of the time in my life, and Democratic two thirds. And so I am a big fan of supporting our president, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=471.76s)]
*  whoever it is, as best you can. And then assessing what they're actually doing. I don't think we [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=479.28s)]
*  should deport 20 million people. I do think we should deport the 500,000 who are like hardened [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=486.15999999999997s)]
*  criminals. And so there's nuance to all these issues. And I'm really excited to be here, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=490.8s)]
*  especially with Chamath, to discuss the nuance in a lot of these positions. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=494.72s)]
*  Megan, I just wait before I get to you, Chamath, who is a loser in Trump 2.1? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=499.76s)]
*  1.0 or 2.0? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=506.64s)]
*  1.0. Sorry. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=507.68s)]
*  Yeah, I you know, I think the xenophobic people I disagree with a ton. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=509.76s)]
*  Who's that? [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=514.24s)]
*  I see. Steve Miller says stuff like America is for Americans and Americans only. I think that [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=514.56s)]
*  kind of rhetoric. You know, he's back. He's running policy for Trump now. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=521.3599999999999s)]
*  I do. I do. Yeah, he's the one I disagree with. And I know his big thing is the border. And you [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=525.1999999999999s)]
*  know, border crossings are down between 90 and 95%. Sure. So again, like we get into the nuance. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=530.0799999999999s)]
*  I think all Americans, like 80, 90% are in favor of closing the border and having an [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=536.88s)]
*  orderly immigration process. But I think this country was actually built by immigrants for [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=541.84s)]
*  immigrants. And so when Steve Miller says something like xenophobic, like, oh, America's only for [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=548.08s)]
*  Americans, Americans only, he's pulling up the ladder. We should actually, Megan, be recruiting [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=553.6s)]
*  the smartest people in the world to come to this country. And that's really at the heart of this [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=559.52s)]
*  Trump 1.0 MAGA OGs versus the techies. And you saw JD Vance sort of tackling this head on on [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=564.72s)]
*  Twitter this week. I think the soul of MAGA is probably being debated. Should we? Do you believe [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=572.5600000000001s)]
*  we should drag the other 19 million hardworking immigrants in this country out of the country? [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=581.2s)]
*  You think the nannies, the dishwashers, the people who've been here for 20 years and built a life, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=586.48s)]
*  you think all 20 million should be dragged out of the country. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=590.64s)]
*  Yeah. And that has majority support amongst the American people. I mean, I'll say this. Stephen [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=593.76s)]
*  Miller has been so demonized by the left and he is absolutely brilliant. The last thing you can get [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=597.52s)]
*  away with is calling that guy a loser. He's gotten helped get Trump elected twice and he's behind not [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=603.68s)]
*  just the immigration policy, but he was in part behind the brilliant EO on gender and biological [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=609.04s)]
*  sex. Stephen Miller is extremely smart, extremely cunning, and those gifts are being- [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=615.2s)]
*  Yeah. ... unleashed on our behalf right now. So, okay. Sorry to make you wait so long, Jamath. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=620.56s)]
*  You think- Welcome to the program. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=624.56s)]
*  You really think that you really think that- Hold on, stand by. It's not just you and me. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=625.4399999999999s)]
*  Okay. We want to get a friend in here. Take it easy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=627.52s)]
*  Get Jamath in here. Would you just relax, okay? [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=629.68s)]
*  Okay. Sorry, Megan. Take it easy. Go ahead, Megan. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=632.8s)]
*  Jamath, happy Valentine's Day. Thank you. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=634.9599999999999s)]
*  How are you feeling about the show so far? You know, it's incredible because Jason never gets [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=637.8399999999999s)]
*  to talk this much on our own podcast. So I understand now why he's just frothing at the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=643.28s)]
*  mouth, but I was going to tell you a little story, which is I dropped my kids off today, [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=648.0s)]
*  my wife and I, and it reminds me that in grade school, you know how you used to [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=653.44s)]
*  treat the person you had a secret crush on the worst? That's Jason's relationship with DJT. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=657.52s)]
*  So I just think that at some point what's happened is Jason has finally realized that he's actually [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=662.88s)]
*  secretly- he admires him so much and now he doesn't know what to do, so now he's just going for it [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=668.0s)]
*  because now he's got cover where most people with a rational brain have said, oh, give this guy a [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=673.12s)]
*  chance. So that's really- Okay, we have some of that actually, just to make your point. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=677.76s)]
*  I think this is a bit of his evolution that we've captured in the following sound, right? [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=682.96s)]
*  Let's take a listen to- Here we go. [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=687.04s)]
*  Here we go. Everybody, welcome back to the All In Podcast. The number one, [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=689.04s)]
*  Magda. I was a Never Trumper and now I'm rooting for him wholeheartedly to do great work. I will say [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=694.0s)]
*  publicans are fun, fashion was off the hook. And all credit to Trump for winning and running [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=701.2s)]
*  an incredible campaign. I mean, just they crushed us as somebody who was a Never Trumper, [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=705.84s)]
*  as you all know in the audience, and now somebody who is supporting him relentlessly. He's also [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=711.2800000000001s)]
*  done an incredible job with the border. 2025's biggest political winner. I said, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=716.72s)]
*  Gen X and the elder millennials. You got Elon with Doge, you got Sax, obviously, Marco Rubio. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=721.52s)]
*  My God, it just goes down. And then if you look at the elder millennials, JD Vance, Vivek, [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=728.8000000000001s)]
*  Tulsi, just a lot of young people, and this is going to be absolutely fantastic, I think. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=733.1999999999999s)]
*  Chamath, he's been red-pilled. He's spent all this time with you guys. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=740.16s)]
*  Purple. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=744.0799999999999s)]
*  It's full red-pilled. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=744.64s)]
*  Well, you know, you said something really important at the beginning, which is [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=746.3199999999999s)]
*  you used the word MAGA 2.0. And I actually think that that's the right observation. MAGA 2.0 is a [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=750.4s)]
*  very different coalition than MAGA 1.0, which just explains, I think, why they did so well at the [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=758.4s)]
*  polls. And the way that I describe it in my own framework is MAGA 2.0 are the working and middle [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=764.48s)]
*  class people that are asset light. And I think that that is important, meaning there's a lot of [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=773.04s)]
*  people that aren't getting stock options, that don't work at a startup, that don't necessarily [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=778.16s)]
*  own a home and are still renting, that don't have these overflowing 401Ks. And that's a lot of where [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=783.12s)]
*  the tension with the American economy and society comes from, right? So I think MAGA speaks to them. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=788.72s)]
*  I think they now speak to patriotic business owners. And they also were able to get these [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=794.32s)]
*  tech leaders and innovators. That's a really unique coalition. And I think that that is very [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=801.6s)]
*  discombobulating for the Democrats. And I think it explains a little bit why [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=807.76s)]
*  they're on their heels and a little confused and don't exactly know how to react in any moment. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=811.76s)]
*  But that MAGA 2.0 coalition, if it holds, I think is multi-generationally relevant. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=816.0s)]
*  Can I ask you, Jason, what you say purple, not red. So what was the red that was mixed in with [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=823.36s)]
*  your former blue that made you purple now? What specifically was it that made you start migrating [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=829.36s)]
*  a bit? Yeah, I mean, I've always been a moderate. And I voted, like I said, maybe [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=833.92s)]
*  living in New York and in California most of my life. I didn't have the opportunity to vote for [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=840.8s)]
*  a Republican that many times, but about one out of three, I voted Republican. And having lived in New [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=847.1999999999999s)]
*  York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco, you don't have to do too much research to see how far the [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=852.4799999999999s)]
*  woke left and these like radical socialist kind of borderline communists in San Francisco, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=860.24s)]
*  how ineffective they've been at running those cities. Watching New York go from when I grew up [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=866.96s)]
*  in the 70s and 80s being pretty dangerous, then Giuliani and Bloomberg cleaning the place up. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=872.0s)]
*  And then now, gosh, it's just gone back into chaos every time I go to New York. And I left San [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=877.28s)]
*  Francisco. I live now on a horse ranch here in Texas in Austin. And it's a lovely purple combination, [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=882.72s)]
*  I think, of what I loved about New York, LA and San Francisco and this Texas culture, which it feels [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=888.48s)]
*  to me like the pure American culture, which is, it's great to be an entrepreneur. It's great to [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=895.12s)]
*  celebrate entrepreneurship and creation, which is the business I'm in. I invest in 100 new companies [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=901.6s)]
*  per year, as well as doing four podcasts a week. So I'm kind of like a broadcaster and an angel [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=906.72s)]
*  investor. And I really was disheartened by what I saw happen with the Democratic Party and how they [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=912.24s)]
*  related to entrepreneurs specifically, myself, Elon, Joe Rogan, Chamath, we're all Democrats or [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=919.6s)]
*  left leaning, right? We believed in freedom, supporting gay rights, supporting a woman's [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=926.96s)]
*  right to choose these kinds of issues. And then the Democratic Party basically kicked Joe Rogan out, [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=932.4s)]
*  they kicked Elon out, and none of us passed their ridiculous, woke, mind virus test. And I'm for [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=938.88s)]
*  freedom. I'm for freedom of speech. I'm a Second Amendment fan. And that party just went so far [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=946.72s)]
*  left. So I feel like I've always been right here in the middle, physically responsible, [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=954.56s)]
*  kind of Clinton Democrat. And then I feel like the Democratic Party just went off the deep end. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=959.6s)]
*  I'm not down with giving surgery to children who are confused about their gender. That's crazy. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=963.92s)]
*  If you ask 100 parents, 99 would say, are you crazy giving surgery to a child who's confused [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=973.6s)]
*  and has gender dysphoria? That's crazy. And now we're seeing many countries in Europe, and in fact, [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=980.8s)]
*  here in the United States, some states saying, hey, yeah, no more of this. And doctors are being [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=988.48s)]
*  sued and the D transitioning movement is just heartbreaking. Why wouldn't a child wait till [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=992.96s)]
*  they're 18, 19, 20 years old? So those were kind of the issues that pushed me out of the Democratic [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=996.88s)]
*  Party. And with Trump and some of the things he does, I don't agree with. But when he put his [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1002.96s)]
*  agenda out for this term, with the exception, again, we talked about it before, of taking [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1010.24s)]
*  hardworking non-criminal immigrants out of the country, which I think would [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1017.84s)]
*  cause massive inflation and all kinds of problems for us, and it would be cruel and inhumane. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1022.24s)]
*  I'm down with less government. I've always been for less government. I've always been for balancing [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1027.68s)]
*  the budget as an individual, as a company, or as a country. And so when he decided he would bring [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1031.8400000000001s)]
*  Elon, who's a close personal friend of mine, and Sachs, close personal friend of mine, [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1039.1200000000001s)]
*  and other folks in our circle into this administration to do hard work and important [[00:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1045.1200000000001s)]
*  work around supporting entrepreneurs and stopping waste, fraud, and abuse, I mean, [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1050.32s)]
*  that's kind of my wheelhouse. So if Trump's going to evolve and he's going to stop being [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1055.3600000000001s)]
*  Captain Chaos, and he's going to stop putting people like Bannon around him, and he's going to [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1059.68s)]
*  put incredible entrepreneurs and the smartest people I know around him, I have no choice but [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1063.92s)]
*  to support him. I don't like some of the things he does stylistically, but I don't really care [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1070.4s)]
*  about style points when it comes to the fact that I believe the country is on such an unsustainable [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1075.8400000000001s)]
*  path in terms of spending. $36 trillion in debt, adding a trillion or two, and the amount of waste [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1082.88s)]
*  and fraud that's going to come out of Doge, I mean, I've had conversations with Elon. He's [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1089.0400000000002s)]
*  been very public about it. He had a presser with Trump in the Oval Office. The stuff that's going [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1093.0400000000002s)]
*  to come out is going to be mind-boggling. The amount of grift, the amount of criminal behavior, [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1098.48s)]
*  and obviously waste, and waste is just so staggering. And we have to turn this around, [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1104.72s)]
*  Megan. If we don't get this debt under control, it's existential. You know, they have this saying, [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1111.44s)]
*  how did you go bankrupt? Slowly and then all at once. And that's where our country is. We need to [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1116.72s)]
*  stop the waste, fraud, abuse, and spending, and it's going to take collective austerity, [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1122.0s)]
*  but we have no choice. And it's going to take really bold leadership. It's unpopular to cut [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1130.0s)]
*  services. It's unpopular to stop spending. But Trump's on a free roll right now. He is, by [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1135.28s)]
*  definition, lame duck, right? He's not running again. So I'm here for him. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1142.4s)]
*  I want to say one word in defense of Steve Bannon, with whom I've had a very interesting [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1145.28s)]
*  past 10 years. I think Steve Bannon is actually very, very brilliant and was integral to Trump's, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1149.6s)]
*  especially his first victory, but I think the second victory too. And I know you may not like [[00:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1157.6s)]
*  him, but I know that he's had quite a hand in staffing up Trump 2.0. And he's always there [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1162.32s)]
*  behind the scenes. He's a brilliant strategist. He may not be your cup of tea. He's not everybody's, [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1169.04s)]
*  but he is very important to Trump's success and has been, in my opinion. I want to say this. [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1173.12s)]
*  On the subject of the illegals, it is 59% of the American public approved deporting all of them, [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1180.1599999999999s)]
*  not just the criminals. The criminals is way up. That's extremely hard, but just anybody who's here [[00:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1184.8799999999999s)]
*  illegally, 59%. I mean, that's huge to have 60% of the country agreeing on an issue like that. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1189.6s)]
*  So that's why Tom Homan is saying they're all going. Now, realistically, are they all going? [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1195.52s)]
*  No, because it's impossible. We're having a difficult time even finding the ones who have [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1200.08s)]
*  committed felonies on top of being here unlawfully. It's just, that's why it was so egregious for Biden [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1204.32s)]
*  to allow them in in the first place. We're just never going to get all these people, even Homan's [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1211.1999999999998s)]
*  out this week saying, look, we've gotten a bunch of them, but it's not going as quickly as I'd like [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1216.1599999999999s)]
*  it to. And it's very frustrating for all of us. Here's one other thing. Let me ask you about this [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1220.08s)]
*  one, Shamath. I love the guys over at National Review and they sometimes offer a sober reality [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1223.76s)]
*  to the joy that I hear more in the MAGA circles. These are conservative Republicans who are not, [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1229.76s)]
*  they're not anti-Trump, but they're not super pro-Trumpy. They had a great discussion on their [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1236.64s)]
*  editor's podcast this week about what's actually going to happen to the budget. Trump's going to [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1241.44s)]
*  make these cutbacks, even if Elon's allowed to go wild, which as you know, they're filing lawsuits [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1246.24s)]
*  every day to try to stop the cuts that he and Trump are doing. But let's just say they withdraw [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1251.28s)]
*  all the lawfare and all the cuts go forward, USAID, Department of Education and on. Their point was [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1255.28s)]
*  it's, we're still going to run a deficit. The budget's still going to go up this year versus [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1262.8799999999999s)]
*  where it was last year. It just won't be up as much as it otherwise would have been. We're not [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1268.3999999999999s)]
*  going to touch entitlement spending. And I got to be honest, you listen and you're like, ah, [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1273.2s)]
*  you know, to Jason's point, slowly and then all of a sudden we're still going to be on that course. [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1278.48s)]
*  We're in a really difficult spot. So I think it's important for your listeners and viewers to know [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1285.36s)]
*  this. The last couple of years, the Biden administration and specifically Biden and Yellen [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1290.32s)]
*  did one thing that I hope no government afterwards ever does, which is they were [[00:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1298.3999999999999s)]
*  effectively speculating on rates. And what they did was, you know, the Treasury's job is to finance [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1302.8s)]
*  the government, right? Their job is to go into the bond market, sell bonds, use that money. So, [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1309.4399999999998s)]
*  and redirect it to HHS, to social security, to defense, wherever. They financed it with all of [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1315.4399999999998s)]
*  this short term paper. And part of it was they believed that inflation would be in check and [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1323.84s)]
*  interest rates in the future would fall. So whatever happened, we would be able to go back [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1330.32s)]
*  into the markets and borrow later for cheaper. It turned out that was an enormously incorrect [[00:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1334.32s)]
*  assumption and they should not have made that decision. So today what Trump and Besant have to [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1341.04s)]
*  do is extremely difficult. They have about $10 trillion. So call it, you know, 25, 30% of our [[00:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1346.8799999999999s)]
*  total debt. We have to refinance in the next six to nine months. And we're doing it against a [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1353.9199999999998s)]
*  backdrop where now inflation is ticking back up and rates are ticking back up. So why is that [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1360.24s)]
*  important? It's important because now all of a sudden, like, what does this budget bill look [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1365.92s)]
*  like and what can we actually accomplish? There's the Senate version, which is super light. And it [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1370.8s)]
*  says, let's just deal with border security and military. And then there's what sort of Trump has [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1375.52s)]
*  asked for, which is the House version, which is this quote unquote, one big, beautiful bill. [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1379.92s)]
*  The problem is those two things are on a collision course. And the big bill may be a little bit [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1384.64s)]
*  too early in the sense that to exactly your point, we don't know how bad the situation is. [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1390.16s)]
*  And if Besant goes into the market and gets clubbed over the head, and now all of a sudden we have [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1395.2s)]
*  $10 trillion that we have to borrow at five or five and a half percent, I think it's going to be [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1400.64s)]
*  really bad for the U S economy, in which case there will be no choice except to make very deep cuts to, [[00:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1406.72s)]
*  in a broad based way. So we almost need to buy some time and figure out how bad the situation is, [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1413.68s)]
*  which is why we need the air cover to sort of see how much Doge uncovers, because that'll make the [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1418.88s)]
*  problem less at the end of the day, right? Because cutting that stuff will mean that's fewer fixed [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1423.8400000000001s)]
*  programs we have to cut. So that's kind of where we are. So I think it's in a very, we're in a [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1428.72s)]
*  delicate 60 to 90 day period, I think. He's not only trying to find cuts, but he's having some fun [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1432.4s)]
*  with tariffs too, which could be another source of income. I mean, Trump announcing yesterday, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1438.64s)]
*  no one's tariffing us without us tariffing them. I'm using it as a verb, right? Like you slept 10% [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1444.3999999999999s)]
*  tariffs on any goods you sell in the United States, 100% guaranteed. That's what you'll get [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1450.8s)]
*  on your goods coming in here. And that just makes sense to me. I mean, like that, I think as a matter [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1456.24s)]
*  of fairness, most people are like, yeah. And even Trump admitted yesterday, there may be some short [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1461.4399999999998s)]
*  term pain. He said there may not be, but he's like, trust me, long term, this is going to work out [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1466.32s)]
*  well for us. How do you guys view the tariff threat and action? [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1472.6399999999999s)]
*  There is some short term wins already. So, you know, he slapped a tariff, I think on [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1477.6799999999998s)]
*  European car imports or whatnot, and they capitulated and they lowered their import [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1483.28s)]
*  tariff for American cars to match their own. So effectively, it was, he said it was five X [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1487.6799999999998s)]
*  greater, right? So if you tried to take a Ford F-150 into Europe, and now that import tariff is [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1494.24s)]
*  effectively the same as what we charge European cars on the way in. So to your point, there's [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1499.84s)]
*  already been some early wins. And then when you look at like Canada and Mexico, the threat of that [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1504.6399999999999s)]
*  20 or 25% tariff essentially caused them to capitulate. So on the one hand, there's trade [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1509.84s)]
*  normalization. On the other hand, it's a negotiating gambit for other things that are more important in [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1515.4399999999998s)]
*  the moment, specifically border security and drugs and all of that stuff in the case of [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1521.04s)]
*  Mexico and Canada. But the reality is like that revenue source, if you offset it somehow, [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1525.52s)]
*  doesn't really do much to make the problem any better. Meaning, if you get a bunch of money in [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1532.88s)]
*  with tariffs, but then you also cut corporate taxes, or you extend the tax cuts for individuals [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1537.8400000000001s)]
*  and make them permanent. The reality is all you're doing is all you're doing is sort of like, you [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  know, taking from Peter to pay Paul, it doesn't make the structural issue any better. And the [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1549.52s)]
*  structural issue is what Jason said, which is, we have a huge debt wall that we are about to hit. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1555.76s)]
*  And we have to find a permanent way out of it. And I think that's where the president is right, [[00:26:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1561.68s)]
*  that there's going to be some short term pain, because I don't see how all of these things [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1568.56s)]
*  actually get to the core structural issue, which is we're just spending too much. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1575.04s)]
*  Congress is appropriating too much money to things that we can't account for. And the law says once [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1579.36s)]
*  Congress says go, you can't say no. He wants to make the Trump tax cuts permanent, which I think [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1584.96s)]
*  most Americans will support. Even Joe Biden was saying he would keep the Trump tax cuts in place [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1593.44s)]
*  for those making under $400,000 a year. But he wanted to revoke them for those making over, [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1599.12s)]
*  which honestly is just silly, because those are the business owners, those are the employers who, [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1605.28s)]
*  you know, I'm an employer, I'm a small business owner, if you tax me more, I'm probably going [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1609.9199999999998s)]
*  to get rid of somebody. I'm not just going to pay it to the federal government, somebody's probably [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1614.1599999999999s)]
*  going to go. So that's how it works. But so he's going to make the tax cuts permanent. He's also [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1618.2399999999998s)]
*  wanting other tax cuts, as you guys know, no taxes on tips. And, you know, I had a conversation with [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1624.0s)]
*  Senate Majority Leader John Thune earlier this week, I think that's a priority for them to get [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1630.0s)]
*  that no taxes on tips thing. And don't forget on the Trump tax cuts, Trump is calling for a return [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1634.32s)]
*  to the salt deduction that those of us have in, you know, like New York, Connecticut, which they [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1638.8s)]
*  didn't give us the first time when they cut the taxes, because they were like, you're not going [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1643.92s)]
*  to get that too. That's too big a tax cut for you. But then the truth is my taxes went up, my account [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1648.0s)]
*  is like, you're actually doing better without these tax cuts, but it's fine. Anyway, my point is, [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1652.64s)]
*  there's, it sounds good to say tax cuts. And I like it too. But there's a question about whether [[00:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1657.5200000000002s)]
*  we can afford all these tax cuts. And no one, no one will talk about Medicare or Social Security, [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1663.2s)]
*  Jason, especially Trump. He's not dumb politically, he knows that's toxic. That's like, let me play in [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1668.16s)]
*  this nuclear waste dump. So fun. This is exactly correct, Megan, you have two ways to cut this [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1673.44s)]
*  massive deficit we have every year and the national debt. You can either increase the amount of money [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1679.84s)]
*  coming in through taxes, or you can cut spending and you've nailed it. There are some big ticket [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1685.52s)]
*  items and Medicare, Social Security, and of course, military spending are the big three, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1690.48s)]
*  we haven't gotten to those yet. But I think that there will be a moment in time when it will become [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1696.6399999999999s)]
*  tenable to talk about these and, you know, maybe just on the margins rethinking them. If you look [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1702.0s)]
*  at the last 10 years, when Biden came into office, you know, we're at 1617 trillion in debt, [[00:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1708.08s)]
*  and now we've basically doubled it. Both parties are out of control with their spending, and they've [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1713.84s)]
*  added two trillion a year. It's not sustainable. Everybody knows that it's about to break. And so [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1719.9199999999998s)]
*  it's going to take collective across both sides of the aisle, looking at not just Doge, but military [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1725.04s)]
*  spending. And this is where actually Trump does have a superpower. He's very good at talking to [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1732.56s)]
*  Xi Jinping and Putin and other dictators. You can make whatever joke you want to make there [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1737.28s)]
*  about how they vibe. But what he did with North Korea and going and talking to Kim Jong-un was [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1742.3999999999999s)]
*  just spectacular. This idea that you don't talk to dictators is a huge colossal mistake in foreign [[00:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1747.76s)]
*  policy. And if he can get everybody to start rethinking how much we're spending globally [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1755.04s)]
*  on defense and maybe paring that back a little bit, and then we can talk to Americans about maybe [[00:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1760.3999999999999s)]
*  instead of Social Security doing what they do in Australia, which is called super annotation. [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1764.72s)]
*  Annuation. Annuation rather. Superannuation, or they just refer to it as supers in that country, [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1769.92s)]
*  if you've ever been there. Instead of giving your money to the government and then the government [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1775.68s)]
*  giving it back to you when you retire, you're forced to put a little bit of money, 10, 12% [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1779.76s)]
*  every year into essentially a directed 401k, but public equities. And if we started moving [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1785.92s)]
*  the country to that, then we could be like Australia eventually where the government's [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1794.4s)]
*  not in the business of providing retirement funds. You do that. You're forced to put money [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1799.92s)]
*  into the markets and then you get the money back as opposed to the government, which is really not [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1804.88s)]
*  great at capital allocation. And the way did you, did you see what Trump said yesterday, [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1810.96s)]
*  which was incredible on your first point. He said, once we get all of this middle East stuff sorted [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1815.68s)]
*  out, my next order of business is to sit down with Putin and Xi Jinping and yeah, [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1819.76s)]
*  we should figure out, yeah, we should be spending 50% less. He said, I was stunned that he said, [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1825.04s)]
*  10% less would be mind blowing. 50% would be 50% is like, but I love the way he negotiates. [[00:30:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1830.8s)]
*  I mean, that's his best quality. Is there any world in which the Chinese who have been working [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1836.8799999999999s)]
*  so steadily over the past 20 years to build up their military actually do that? I just like, [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1842.08s)]
*  he would deserve the Nobel peace prize if he were to make that happen. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1847.8400000000001s)]
*  They have systematic problems there, Megan, like they got serious problems. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1851.6000000000001s)]
*  They do, but that military is important to them. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1856.0s)]
*  The problem is that we have like two versions of the military. We have the old school neocon [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1860.8s)]
*  version, which is still the dominant version on the ground, which is the projection of power, [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1866.0s)]
*  right? How do you project power? You have, you know, aircraft carriers and you have these F-35 [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1870.16s)]
*  planes and you have these huge frigates and all of this stuff, right? The Navy just announced a, [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1875.68s)]
*  you know, a 30 year program. They're going to spend $1.2 trillion. They'll get 365 boats, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1880.8s)]
*  right? Which is like, okay, but the, but the real version is what Andrew is doing, [[00:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1887.28s)]
*  which is everything is drone warfare. Everything is about AI's. You see it on the ground today in [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1892.88s)]
*  the Ukraine and Russia, which is that's how you fight a modern war. So that costs meaningfully [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1897.68s)]
*  less. And it's not necessarily a projection of power as much as it is a projection of capability [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1904.32s)]
*  and skill. So if you take the latter approach, you could easily spend 50% less. The former approach [[00:31:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1909.6s)]
*  really is about building big iron and big metal. And we all know that's complicated and it takes [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1916.08s)]
*  a long time. So you need a philosophical shift in how people think about geopolitics and the [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1921.12s)]
*  projection of power. This is why- On this front, this is not exactly the same thing, but it's [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1926.32s)]
*  consistent with the new approach that this administration is taking. We have of course, [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1932.16s)]
*  a new defense secretary and it's not a big deal, but he is every morning out there working out with [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1935.52s)]
*  troops. When he was back stateside, he was doing it. Now he's over in Poland. He's doing it. He [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1941.92s)]
*  posted this video today of him running with troops over in Poland saying, you know, fitness [[00:32:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1947.1200000000001s)]
*  readiness starts in the beginning of the day. There's no, you know, do we have a slot? We'll run it. [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1953.1200000000001s)]
*  It's just pictures. Okay. It's just pictures. By the way, he needs pants. It's too cold in Poland [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1958.4s)]
*  to run with just shorts on. Oh, is Pete running in shorts? He's running in shorts. He's running in [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1964.8000000000002s)]
*  shorts. It's snowy and it's Poland. But in any event, I like it too. I have to say, you know, [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1967.92s)]
*  like Lloyd Austin, with all due respect, was overweight, was in the hospital unaccounted for, [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1975.1200000000001s)]
*  for like a week. We didn't know what was wrong with him. Oh right. I remember that. It's great [[00:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1982.96s)]
*  to see a young, robust defense chief and just a juxtaposition in the messaging now where he's [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1987.44s)]
*  saying that we've had a record sign up and increase in troop numbers in December in anticipation of [[00:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=1994.0800000000002s)]
*  Trump taking office and now in January once Trump has, and he points to specifically, [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2000.0800000000002s)]
*  among other things, the difference in recruiting efforts. Like look at the ad [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2005.6000000000001s)]
*  that they just put out for special forces under the Trump DOD. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2010.16s)]
*  The listing audience says US Army. It's this enormous guy lifting enormous weights. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2020.4s)]
*  Stronger people are harder to kill. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2026.16s)]
*  Strong people are harder to kill. That seems right. But just to, just so you have the full picture, [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2029.76s)]
*  stand by. Here's what they were running under Joe Biden. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2034.64s)]
*  And after meeting with an army recruiter, I found it a way to prove my inner strength [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2064.8799999999997s)]
*  and maybe shatter some stereotypes along the way. [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2071.2799999999997s)]
*  Oh my gosh, the difference guys. It's great. I mean, as men, you, you must see the difference [[00:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2075.7599999999998s)]
*  in messaging and why the numbers are going up. Well, look, I think that it's like, there was [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2083.52s)]
*  like this fever and I think it's broken. And the thing is it should be okay to be able to look at [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2088.72s)]
*  certain job categories and basically say, what is it that we need? So what should firefighters be [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2095.4399999999996s)]
*  able to do more than anything else? They should be able to put out fires and everything that that [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2100.9599999999996s)]
*  entails. What should, you know, a spec ops person be able to do? They should be able to kill with [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2104.3999999999996s)]
*  precision. And somehow we lost that where you weren't allowed to say those things anymore. [[00:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2110.3199999999997s)]
*  And now I think we're getting back to just the common sense of it all. And there are other jobs, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2115.36s)]
*  by the way, that should be governed by empathy and compassion and you should optimize for those. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  That's like a well functioning society. And I don't know how we lost that script, but I think [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2124.1600000000003s)]
*  we're slowly getting back to that. This is a big admission, Megan, because I don't know if you've [[00:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2129.28s)]
*  ever seen Chamath's thirst trap that he posted on social media, but he has very thin legs. His legs [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2133.36s)]
*  are not capable of carrying. He would not be a great firefighter. He can't carry anybody. [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2139.0400000000004s)]
*  Is that what you're saying? No, Megan, I'm tall. You know, he's tall, but he's got very thin legs. [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2144.7200000000003s)]
*  No, that's not true. That's what robust legs look like when you're six. Cut the photo in. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2149.52s)]
*  Please go find the photo to my team. We're getting it right now. But the military issue really is [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2155.2000000000003s)]
*  that what's going to happen, you know, on future military excursions, we're going to have to go [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2163.28s)]
*  on and go look like the Ukraine or going to look like Ukraine. Sorry to put the thought in there. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2171.28s)]
*  You are going to have drones and there's a good friend of mine. Palmer Lucky has a company called [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2176.48s)]
*  Andrew that's doing particularly well in this regard. There's another one, Vanton Systems, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2181.6800000000003s)]
*  VATN. I'm not an investor or anything, but I had them on my podcast and they were showing me their [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2185.44s)]
*  underwater drones. You can cut in a video of it. It's really cool. Vanton Systems and you can just [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2190.2400000000002s)]
*  walk us through it here for the audience. Show us what you've built and walk us through. Yeah. So [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2194.8s)]
*  right here, you're seeing our engineers out testing and working through the vehicles [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2199.44s)]
*  themselves. So we are seeing here is a man portable vehicle being carried by our CTO right there. [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2204.88s)]
*  And now it's running through the water. But, you know, our first product we call the Torsk on the [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2210.2400000000002s)]
*  commercial side or the ScaleMir S6 on the defense side. And it's a six inch diameter, really [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2216.4s)]
*  lightweight and a fraction of the cost of existing options with the ultimate goal of really building [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2222.96s)]
*  them at scale, which we're going to start next year and making it easy for one person to deploy [[00:37:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2227.68s)]
*  a whole bunch of these and really control a multitude. They are producing these underwater [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2233.52s)]
*  drones for 75, 85% less than what the military spends now. This is exactly what Elon did for [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2240.48s)]
*  putting people in space and he lowered the cost by 90%. Those opportunities exist. And so if we can [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2248.96s)]
*  reimagine the military, we could have more capability. We could be more competitive and we [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2256.32s)]
*  can do it at literally 50, 60, 70% less if we unleash innovation and entrepreneurship. And this [[00:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2263.28s)]
*  is the thing that pushed me out of the Democratic Party back to the original question you had for me. [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2271.76s)]
*  We have to support founders. It is very hard to start a company. You suffer. You're doing it now, [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2276.48s)]
*  right? You got to exist in Fox and NBC and take the Lincoln Town cars and have all this stuff. [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2281.76s)]
*  Now you're an entrepreneur, right? You got to be scrappy and you got to fight. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2287.44s)]
*  The Democratic Party abandoned and shamed entrepreneurs and they're still doing it. [[00:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2292.0s)]
*  Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders are out there every day attacking Elon for doing [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2297.44s)]
*  something he doesn't need to do right now. He's already incredibly wealthy. He's got Tesla. He's [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2304.0s)]
*  got SpaceX to work on and he's taking a side quest for the American people. [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2308.88s)]
*  No, bro. He's moving into the government. [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2313.28s)]
*  This is costing him billions. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2316.8s)]
*  Yeah, he's moved in. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2317.44s)]
*  I know. And just before I give you the floor on it, Shamath, here's the thing about Elon. [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2318.4s)]
*  He could have gotten the deregulation that he wants for his industries just by all the donations [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2321.76s)]
*  and the blood, sweat and treasure he gave to Trump prior to November 5th. Trump owed him enough [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2325.6800000000003s)]
*  that he would have probably tried to help Elon roll back some of the red tape he once rolled back [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2331.04s)]
*  without Elon doing a single thing post-10-5. Everything he's doing now is because he genuinely [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2336.32s)]
*  wants reform. He wants the government to work differently for all of us, not just for him. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2343.84s)]
*  Go ahead, Shamath. [[00:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2349.2000000000003s)]
*  There is a framework that we talk about. I've talked about it a few times now. I'll just [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2350.88s)]
*  share it with your audience to the extent it's valuable. I think we all want to be [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2357.1200000000003s)]
*  and remain the most important country in the world. That should be not really controversial. [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2361.92s)]
*  But the problem is that we have somehow found a way to debate how to get there. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2368.08s)]
*  And I think how to get there has always been the same and will always be the same, [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2373.6000000000004s)]
*  which is America is the best when it has the most vibrant economy in the world and the most capable [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2376.88s)]
*  and powerful military in the world. That's it. And whenever any country has had those two things, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2383.76s)]
*  if you look back in history, thousands of years, they've always been the most important and the [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2389.68s)]
*  most vibrant place, whether it's Rome or whether it's the British Empire. But underneath that [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2394.72s)]
*  is one thing in this modern iteration, which is you must have technical supremacy. You must. [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2401.68s)]
*  If you make the best clothes, it doesn't mean much. You could have a vibrant fashion industry, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2408.24s)]
*  but it's not going to give you economic vibrancy or military supremacy. If you have great buildings, [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2412.7999999999997s)]
*  it doesn't do anything. If you have you need technology supremacy. And this is why [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2419.44s)]
*  what Jason said is so critical. So why is Elon in there? I think part of what he's in there to do [[00:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2424.2400000000002s)]
*  is to make sure that by helping to bat back some of these regulations, it's not just him, [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2430.48s)]
*  but there's so many others that hit this air pocket now that can actually do stuff on behalf [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2435.44s)]
*  of Team America. And if you're technically supreme, your economy will be the best. [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2440.32s)]
*  Your military will be the best. By the way, like, look at like two days ago, there's a $24 billion [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2446.08s)]
*  program to arm the army with this incredible next generation vision system. Initially, it was given [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2452.08s)]
*  to Microsoft. Microsoft realized they couldn't do it. What did they do? They gave it to a startup, [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2458.7999999999997s)]
*  Andrew. Now what happens that technical supremacy filters in through the economy gets into our [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2463.84s)]
*  military, our military will be that much better than everybody else. And that cycle for whatever [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2470.0s)]
*  reason was frozen in time for literally 15 years. And this is what we need to undo. And in that 15 [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2475.52s)]
*  years, the biggest mistake we made was we allowed China to catch up. And now they have a level of [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2482.32s)]
*  technical supremacy that rivals ours, and in some cases exceeds us. And that was a mistake that we [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2487.6s)]
*  allowed to happen. And we need to battle with them on many fronts, including AI, though not so much [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2494.88s)]
*  the Europeans. One of the things that happened this week was JD Vance went over to Europe. And [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2501.44s)]
*  at a conference that was dedicated to discussing slowing the AI march, he thumbed the middle finger [[00:41:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2507.68s)]
*  essentially and said, we're not slowing anything. We're the United States of America. We're leaders [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2514.08s)]
*  on this. And we intend to stay leaders on this. And then he made some other news, which I want to [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2518.56s)]
*  get to with you. But I just want to make one point on the drones. These things can be very threatening, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2523.68s)]
*  potentially used by us and potentially used against us. And there was a report out earlier [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2528.0s)]
*  this week on how the Iranian threat against Trump's life was more serious than we knew. [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2532.88s)]
*  And it was to the point where they were deploying decoy Trump planes when not Air Force One, but [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2539.76s)]
*  Trump Force One, as they used to call his private plane when he was campaigning, to where like they [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2547.28s)]
*  just have staff on the one plane. And some of these staff would later say like, Whoa, what like [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2551.6s)]
*  we were on the decoy plane trying to like say, Hey, Iran, Trump's here. When he wasn't really [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2557.36s)]
*  there, like uncool. But they were reporting that. I'm trying to remember who broke this. It was a [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2561.12s)]
*  very good report, but it was talking about, it was Axios. Okay. And it was talking about how at one [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2567.28s)]
*  point there was a drone hovering over Trump's vehicle as he was traveling. And the security [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2571.12s)]
*  secret service opened up the sunroof and shot it, shot it down right then and there. But that's [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2578.56s)]
*  like the, these drones are effective. It's, it's incredible that you say this. Do you know what the [[00:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2584.8s)]
*  largest military company in the world is now? It's DJI. This was a Chinese drone company that people [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2589.6000000000004s)]
*  relied on just for drones when drones were this, you know, a consumer pastime, [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2598.0800000000004s)]
*  a toy, but, but when it turned the corner, especially in this Ukraine, Russia war, [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2603.1200000000003s)]
*  where it became the de facto method of effective attack, they sell parts every which way. Now, [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2607.84s)]
*  I'm not saying DJI is doing anything bad. I don't think they are. They're selling drones. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2614.24s)]
*  Somehow it gets redirected and finds itself in all these places, but it's an attack vector. [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2618.64s)]
*  And in as much as it's an attack vector, that is now the largest military company in the world. [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2623.04s)]
*  It's China. It's based in China. It's an incredible thing. It's not Lockheed Martin. It's not anybody [[00:43:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2626.7999999999997s)]
*  else. And you know what? There's a lot of scrappy people, Megan, working on this. I read a story in [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2634.0s)]
*  the Wall Street Journal about some University of Toronto students who made a dish that uses [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2639.44s)]
*  acoustics to interfere with the components specifically of DJI drones. It's called Prantle [[00:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2647.04s)]
*  Dynamics, P-R-A-N-D-T-L Dynamics. So I had them on my podcast. I talked to them a whole bunch about [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2652.96s)]
*  how the technology works and they were just students. And I said, Hey, terrible name, by the [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2659.76s)]
*  way, to get funded. Terrible name. Anyway, point is, P-R-A-N-D-T-L. You can just talk. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2664.24s)]
*  Basically, they knock drones out of the sky. So I talked to them. I check out the technology. [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2671.2s)]
*  It actually works. So I actually gave them the angel investing money to start this company. [[00:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2675.12s)]
*  Tell them to call it Drone Strike. Drone Strike. That would be the new name. Yeah. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2679.2799999999997s)]
*  So there's all this technology that is coming out. And you know, venture capitalists, Megan, [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2684.56s)]
*  it was very interesting when I started, I don't know, I started angel investing 12, 13 years ago. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2690.32s)]
*  It's just a side thing to support my friends. And at that time, venture capitalists wouldn't [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2695.92s)]
*  invest in military technology. And in fact, at Google, you know, the kind of resistance inside [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2701.52s)]
*  of Google was protesting them even providing things like Google Docs, like Gmail to the military. [[00:45:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2708.1600000000003s)]
*  And now that's totally turned around. Silicon Valley is enamored. And investors like myself, [[00:45:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2715.84s)]
*  Chamath and others, Sachs too, you know, we're looking and saying, hey, this is actually the [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2722.48s)]
*  patriotic thing to do. On Trump 2.0. By the way, sorry, just on that, let me tell you a quick story. [[00:45:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2726.6400000000003s)]
*  So I seeded this company about eight or nine years ago to make drones for the sea. It's called [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2734.56s)]
*  sail drone. Yeah, great company. And you know, sail drone now has contracts with the Coast Guard and [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2741.68s)]
*  the Navy and all of this stuff. But these are, as you can imagine, autonomous drones that you can [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2746.7999999999997s)]
*  deploy literally from the United States, and it can get to any conflict hotspot. And it has all [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2750.64s)]
*  of the sensor arrays it needs to collect information, send it back, etc. But to your point, Jason, [[00:45:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2756.72s)]
*  the obvious thing five years ago, would have been to add some kind of kinetic ability to those drones, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2761.8399999999997s)]
*  right? Meaning those drones, by the way, one of our drones was famously intercepted by the [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2767.84s)]
*  Iranian Navy. Okay. I think in the Strait of Hormuz or someplace. But the reason we weren't [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2773.28s)]
*  able to add that, you know, kinetic ability five years ago, is because sort of internally, [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2779.92s)]
*  when you're building these things in, you know, Berkeley, California, people, people have an [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2786.08s)]
*  opinion on that this is not cool, or this is the patriotic thing is to actually not make these [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2791.12s)]
*  things happen. And somewhere along the way now, I think we've had a couple of examples, Andrew being [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2797.92s)]
*  the best where no, the patriotic thing is to actually make sure Pax America wins. And, [[00:46:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2802.72s)]
*  and it's incredible that we it took all this time for us to be able to say that without sounding [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2808.3199999999997s)]
*  like some, you know, right wing loon. And now we have to play catch up, which I think is the thing [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2812.64s)]
*  that frustrates me a little bit. It makes me concerned, quite honestly. But if we can, if we [[00:46:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2818.8s)]
*  can get it done, then I think we'll be in a bunch better place. It's happening. All I can think of [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2823.2000000000003s)]
*  is my husband's book, The Mysterious Case of Rudolf diesel, which is about the Elon Musk of [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2827.52s)]
*  the early 20th century, Rudolf diesel, who was German born, spent his childhood in France, [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2832.48s)]
*  and was this genius who designed the diesel engine, he, you know, it was his engine and diesel should [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2840.0800000000004s)]
*  be spelled with a capital D to this day, when you go to the gas station, it's diesel capital D [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2845.12s)]
*  fuel for diesel engine after this guy, but he was a peacenik. He was definitely a peacenik and did [[00:47:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2849.7599999999998s)]
*  not want this, this engine to be used in war machines. His, his idea, his goal was for it to [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2855.52s)]
*  be used on like small farms who could put just vegetable oil in it and he can run off vegetable [[00:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2861.2799999999997s)]
*  oil. Willie Nelson powered his diesel powered, I don't know, van or camper with corn oil. And [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2865.6s)]
*  that's really what diesel thought it would be, but it wound up becoming so important to war [[00:47:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2872.88s)]
*  vehicles to have war, war boats in particular, both in England and Germany and then around the [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2878.4s)]
*  world. And there's really not a massive boat on the water. That's not powered by diesel now. [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2884.08s)]
*  And Doug has talked many times about how, like, what would diesel think if he could see how his [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2888.8s)]
*  engine wound up getting used as like the main machine of war. And I think he, he believes diesel [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2892.7200000000003s)]
*  would be against it because he never had the evolution, the final stage of the evolution. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2898.08s)]
*  You just talked about your mouth, you know, it's a lot of these inventors start off feeling more [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2902.08s)]
*  altruistic and, you know, they think their products are going to go a different way, [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2906.16s)]
*  but then it takes a while for you to evolve to the, to realizing even if in a machine of war, [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2909.92s)]
*  it can be an instrument of peace in a way. Yeah, it is the worst. [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2914.4s)]
*  Look at the sorry, go ahead. No, I was going to say is like, I mean, look at what happened [[00:48:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2919.6s)]
*  through the Manhattan project that started out as a complete project of war. But if you look at the [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2924.72s)]
*  downstream positive impacts of nuclear energy, the body of knowledge that we were able to accumulate, [[00:48:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2929.6s)]
*  essentially because it was directed through a war effort, whether you agree with that issue or not, [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2936.64s)]
*  take that off the table, but it is undisputable how productive and useful nuclear energy is all [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2941.2s)]
*  around the world, how impactful it can be to actually give people a better life. But it would [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2946.72s)]
*  not have advanced as quickly and as safely had we not gone through those phases of the Manhattan [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2953.52s)]
*  project. A different example is the Apollo program. You know, we spent in today's dollars, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2958.56s)]
*  a quarter of a trillion dollars getting to the moon in the late 1960s and early 70s. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2963.68s)]
*  That is the basis of everything we touch and feel today. When you look at a computer, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2970.08s)]
*  all of these incredible inventions came out of a government program that was about [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2975.7599999999998s)]
*  excellence in part motivated by beating a competitor of ours in Russia or the Soviet [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2980.64s)]
*  Union at the time. So to your point, sometimes you have to be able to take these inventions and [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2986.0s)]
*  just have a grain of humility and say, you know what, like these things take a meandering path. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2991.36s)]
*  And as long as you can eventually direct them constructively, you got a responsibility to do [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=2996.56s)]
*  it. But when you get caught up in all of the virtue signaling and this other stuff, I think you can [[00:50:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3000.8s)]
*  really slow things down and have impacts. I got to give the floor to J Cal when we come back from [[00:50:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3005.84s)]
*  this quick break. But before we go, we found the picture. We're going to, we report, you decide. [[00:50:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3010.4s)]

*  the first hour, passing reference to this show and your show and my status and yours as well as [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3117.84s)]
*  an independent broadcaster. And that brought something up that I've been meaning to mention [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3127.04s)]
*  this whole week and now is as good a time as any. So over the weekend, it was announced that [[00:52:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3131.28s)]
*  Fox News had acquired, has acquired the company called Red Seat Ventures, which sells our ads. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3137.04s)]
*  They sell the ads for the Megyn Kelly show, Red Sea Corporation. And Fox acquired this company [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3145.44s)]
*  because they sell ads not just for the Megyn Kelly show, but for the Tucker Carlson show, [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3151.68s)]
*  for Bill O'Reilly show, for now Piers Morgan, who's got a YouTube show and so on. And that's [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3155.6s)]
*  one of the challenges when you get into the space as an independent, you kind of have to partner [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3162.16s)]
*  with some sort of somebody who's got relationships with the ad companies. It's very, very difficult [[00:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3166.64s)]
*  to do it yourself. You can't just start calling up Jenny Sell and saying, hey, will you advertise [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3171.2s)]
*  on the MK show? So Red Seat and this guy who runs it named Chris Balf, they've been great partners [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3176.24s)]
*  to us and I love Chris and he's been absolutely wonderful and his whole team to work with. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3180.7999999999997s)]
*  So they help us out. They sell our ads. He's been an advisor to me in my professional life as well. [[00:53:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3185.8399999999997s)]
*  So the media decides to take this story and announce, or at least spin it such that [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3192.3999999999996s)]
*  I have been acquired by Fox News, that the Megyn Kelly show is now owned by Fox, that the Tucker [[00:53:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3199.2s)]
*  Carlson show is now owned by Fox. They spun it as we're going home. There was one article from [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3206.24s)]
*  Reuters. The deal brings O'Reilly, Kelly and Carlson back into the Murdoch fold through Red [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3213.36s)]
*  Seat Ventures, though Red Seat Ventures will operate independently within Fox's 2B media group. [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3218.56s)]
*  No, it doesn't. It does not bring any of us back into the Murdoch fold. Nothing against the Murdochs, [[00:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3224.32s)]
*  nothing against Fox. Very happy for Chris and Red Seat and for Fox, but this has almost nothing to [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3229.44s)]
*  do with us other than, I guess, Fox and 2B are now eventually going to, well, they own the company, [[00:53:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3234.88s)]
*  or most of it. That's selling our ads. That's it. But it was so annoying, you guys, because I know [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3241.1200000000003s)]
*  you've worked for every ounce of that success and for every notch you've moved up on the podcast [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3247.76s)]
*  ranking. And maybe it would have been helpful. I never offered it and I never wanted it, but [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3252.64s)]
*  probably would have been helpful to have the backing of a company like Fox News pushing me. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3258.16s)]
*  But I didn't have it and you didn't have it. We earned all those ranks ourselves. For once in [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3262.64s)]
*  my professional life, Fox News had nothing to do with one single viewer I have. Right? [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3268.08s)]
*  And now they're taking credit. [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3273.68s)]
*  So it was annoying. Yeah, it was annoying to see this spun everywhere as some sort of an acquisition [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3274.48s)]
*  or a sellout by yours truly or Tucker, who I'm sure would never be selling to Fox. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3281.28s)]
*  But it makes Fox look good to make it look like they acquired us, which they didn't and whatever. [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3287.76s)]
*  So it's kind of annoying. Anyway, Chris Balfe went on the Semaphore podcast with Ben Smith, [[00:54:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3292.4s)]
*  formerly of the New York Times and Buzzfeed. And they talked about this. And here's a bit of the [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3297.6800000000003s)]
*  exchange that just hit today. One of the most fascinating things, the deal is that you are the [[00:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3302.2400000000002s)]
*  platform for three of the biggest stars Fox has ever had. Megan Kelly, Tucker Carlson, Bill O'Reilly. [[00:55:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3306.32s)]
*  And Piers had a relationship with Fox, but a little different. And you have this radically [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3312.0800000000004s)]
*  different relationship with them, which was when Fox News, when you work for Fox News, [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3316.32s)]
*  you really work for Fox News. You do whatever they say. You do not do things they don't say. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3320.56s)]
*  They have total control over everything you do. When you work for Red Seat, like Red Seat sort of [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3324.96s)]
*  works for you. It's an inverted relationship in which the talent has a lot of power. You [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3330.48s)]
*  get to work for them to the degree that you're providing great service for them and [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3336.8s)]
*  great money for them. But it's an inverse relationship where you, as the media company, [[00:55:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3341.12s)]
*  just have so much less control. You're kind of an agency for talent. [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3346.56s)]
*  Chris Balfe You're exactly right about the [[00:55:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3350.08s)]
*  characterization of the relationship. We work for them, they don't work for us. And we operate [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3352.08s)]
*  with pleasure of these hosts. And the minute that they see someone who's doing better for them, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3356.8s)]
*  who can help them monetize better or grow their show better or whatever it may be that we're [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3362.1600000000003s)]
*  doing in each individual case, then they can move. This is the way that this business works. And so [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3365.6000000000004s)]
*  if you want to be part of the creator economy, you have to realize that creators are in charge. [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3372.7200000000003s)]
*  And it's our job to do as good of a job for them as we possibly can to make sure that they do want [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3377.92s)]
*  to be with us and not somebody else. I can like faintly hear like shrieks coming from [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3383.68s)]
*  Fox News World and you say creators are in charge. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3387.6s)]
*  It's pretty funny, right? So anyway, just to set the record clear, what he said is exactly right. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3394.16s)]
*  Red Seat's not a platform for us. You know, SiriusXM is a platform. Apple, Spotify, those are [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3398.56s)]
*  YouTube. That's a platform. Red Seat's a partner that sells our ads and gives us some information [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3403.44s)]
*  on the podcasting industry. And Balfe personally has been a great friend to my husband. [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3408.24s)]
*  The reason why the tradition of media writes that article is that they are hoping that some [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3414.0s)]
*  of these viewers may get turned off by it and stop watching or listening to you. That's the point. [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3419.52s)]
*  They're jealous. They're jealous and diminishing you. You know, that's what's really happening here [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3424.24s)]
*  is I think independent. It's very rare for somebody to come out of the Fox World and be able to actually [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3429.6s)]
*  start a business. I've been in publishing my whole life and really publishing is three things. You [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3436.4s)]
*  got to have talent, which you clearly have. You have to have distribution, which has now been [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3440.32s)]
*  democratized. You've just given RSS feed to Spotify and to Apple and you're good to go. [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3445.2000000000003s)]
*  And then you need to have ad sales. I'm actually shocked that you haven't brought that in-house [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3450.6400000000003s)]
*  yet because there's a hundred ad sales people who will send their resume to you right now. [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3454.56s)]
*  And your cost of ad sales should be 10% or lower if you had an in-house team based on, you know, [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3459.52s)]
*  my knowledge of what you're doing. A whole new future. You're laying out for me here, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3466.4s)]
*  J Cal. Keep going. Well, the rep firms tend to take 25 to 40% and that's fine to start out. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3469.52s)]
*  But for you to be a truly independent media company, you need to control that piece of the puzzle [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3476.0s)]
*  and you can very easily and you will. I guarantee you by next year and I make millions of dollars [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3480.64s)]
*  a year off this week in startups. All in doesn't have advertising. We probably leave 25, 50 million [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3486.08s)]
*  on the table every year because my co-hosts refuse to let me read the ads. I keep asking them, [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3491.44s)]
*  let me read the ads. You know why, Megan? Private aviation. Private aviation. I could be in a [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3497.76s)]
*  phenom 300. I could be in a Pilatus PC 24 if chun moth would let me read one goddamn ad on the [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3504.0800000000004s)]
*  shelf. Eat the rich. And this is what I can make you crazy. Private aviation. But we make our money [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3510.96s)]
*  through the events we host and that's a great business. And you were there. Thank you for [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3518.32s)]
*  coming. It was awesome. And our new tequila and we're going to do all in tequila. And you know, [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3522.6400000000003s)]
*  I got to spend some time with Ben Shapiro when I went to the inauguration who I have great respect [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3526.56s)]
*  for and his team and what he's going to do. Are you going to make a point? Are you trying to make a point? [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3531.92s)]
*  I am. And you know, the other thing that's very interesting is what he's doing with cigars, razors, [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3534.56s)]
*  etc. They made their own brands. I think Megan Kelly, you need, I don't know what you drink. [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3540.16s)]
*  You drink a Sauvignon Blanc. What are you, what is Megan Kelly doing on the leases? What's going on [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3545.7599999999998s)]
*  tonight on a Friday? I've actually become a big fan of gin, to tell you the truth. I'm a big fan of gin these days. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3550.48s)]
*  A little G and T? Yeah. Or like just gin and club soda with a lemon. I actually really like that. [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3553.92s)]
*  I call it the gin haven. All right, listen, make MK's gin haven right now. Let's get a gin company [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3561.6s)]
*  on here. You brand it, you put it in cans, bottles, whatever. It's going to make a billion dollars. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3568.8s)]
*  Let's get Megan Kelly paid. That's what I'm talking about. We're doing all in. I love where this is going. [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3573.52s)]
*  All in. But I love what you guys just said because that's what was so annoying to me. Like, Yahoo! [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3578.32s)]
*  Their headline, Yahoo Finance, was that they've acquired, that I've gone home, that they've [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3583.84s)]
*  acquired my home. Like Red Seat, with all due respect, is not my home. My home is my show, [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3590.96s)]
*  my editorial, and I put my home out to a various degree of platforms, right? Like to YouTube. [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3596.8s)]
*  They hate you because they ain't you, Megan. That's it. They hate you because they ain't you. [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3604.0s)]
*  Just keep doing you. Well, I didn't want people to be confused. I didn't want, like if Fox News, [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3608.56s)]
*  if I did sell out to Fox News, if Fox News owned the Megan Kelly show, it would change. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3611.76s)]
*  What they were getting at there with Ben Smith and Chris Balf was exactly right. Fox does control [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3616.2400000000002s)]
*  everybody who works there. Trust me, I know. That's why it's so amazing to be in the independent lane, [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3622.1600000000003s)]
*  right? It's like, you guys say, you can say whatever the hell you want. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3628.48s)]
*  The thing that's changed is that the news has become totally commoditized, right? You can [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3632.88s)]
*  basically get the same facts everywhere. I think what people have sniffed out is that it's people's [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3638.72s)]
*  opinions, especially smart people, who are consistent. That's what matters. Your one, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3644.16s)]
*  Tucker's one, on the left, Ezra Klein is one. There's people on both sides, but my point is that [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3650.24s)]
*  what people don't care about is if you, for example, wrote an article and the byline said [[01:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3656.3199999999997s)]
*  the New York Times, you just wouldn't care as much as you used to. In five years, they'll care even [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3661.9199999999996s)]
*  less. And it's the same with Fox. Now, those people, for a moment, they had the right to have [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3666.72s)]
*  the business model that they did because, you know, let's take Fox as an example. They literally [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3673.4399999999996s)]
*  spent billions of dollars to build the broadcast infrastructure to get in front of people, but [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3677.9199999999996s)]
*  that's been undone. And so now I think the next 20 or 30 years will be about people who can be [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3683.3599999999997s)]
*  articulate, consistent, interesting. You know, some people will want partisan, some people will [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3689.3599999999997s)]
*  want independent, but that sorting function is going on right now. And I think that's why the [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3695.2s)]
*  media, I don't want to say that they lie, but I think that they can be, their insecurity around [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3699.8399999999997s)]
*  this one thing comes through in so many articles. You see it in the Doge articles. You see it in this [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3706.0s)]
*  article about the red seat. You see it everywhere if you're paying attention for it, which is what [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3711.7599999999998s)]
*  they're really expressing is we're not nearly as important as we used to be. And so they have to go [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3717.04s)]
*  to more and more extremes because the relaying of the news doesn't really add that much value. [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3722.32s)]
*  You can go on X and get that in eight seconds. And control, Megan, this is about control. You know, [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3727.68s)]
*  you and Tucker, supremely talented. They controlled you because they gave you these giant multi-year [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3733.52s)]
*  deals. You guys were at the top of your game. Eight-figure deals is extraordinary. You guys [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3739.44s)]
*  top-ticked it, as we say in the business, you hit the peak. And it's scary to be talent and then [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3744.4s)]
*  start from zero again. But you did it. And now you control it. And now Tucker controls it. But, [[01:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3750.56s)]
*  you know, you can see their top-down control ruins the editorial. You can see it in that dominion [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3756.24s)]
*  case that Fox had to settle. It matters. They start, yeah, and they start messing with you. And [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3761.44s)]
*  they try to steer you in one direction or the other. It's even more so. The audience gets it. [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3768.16s)]
*  The audience understands it now. Yeah. And it's more subtle than that. You don't need a $750 million [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3772.48s)]
*  lawsuit to go against you. Now what you have are things like the CBS clip of 60 Minutes. Yes. All [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3778.72s)]
*  of that just subtly chips away at people's trust, right? Now, I used to watch 60 Minutes religiously [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3786.16s)]
*  on Sundays. When I was growing up as a kid, I thought, okay, this is where I, you know, [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3792.16s)]
*  watch for an hour and I'm a little bit smarter for it. And now when you see these kinds of things, [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3796.8s)]
*  you think to yourself, what is the point of even watching these clips? And then when you see the [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3802.64s)]
*  clip being distributed, you think to yourself, well, is this yet another moment where CBS cherry [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3806.4s)]
*  picks the editing of something to portray a message? I don't want the cognitive load of having to deal [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3811.12s)]
*  with that and figure it out. I got, you know, I have kids, I have a business, I have a family. [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3817.6800000000003s)]
*  I am trying to live my life. Just give it to me straight. And if you're giving me an opinion, [[01:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3822.96s)]
*  I want to know upfront that it's your opinion. But what I don't want is the manipulation. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3826.7200000000003s)]
*  It really is. Over time, you realize who you can trust and who you cannot. And for, you know, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3831.44s)]
*  for me, it's like, that's it's fine. You know, I'm happy for Chris, I'm happy for Fox, but it [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3835.2s)]
*  matters who controls this show. And it's somewhere suggesting like they have an ownership. I own [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3841.6s)]
*  100% of the Megyn Kelly show. I don't have investors. I have nobody. I have me. And, [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3846.48s)]
*  and that's the other thing. Like, they're not wrong. When I worked at Fox, you couldn't say [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3851.7599999999998s)]
*  any, if you said anything like to the press, Irina Briganti, that snake would be all over you. They'd [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3855.9199999999996s)]
*  be dropping hip pieces on you to try to control you. And I'm delighted to have nothing to do with [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3862.64s)]
*  this person. She I don't know, you know what, I don't think Fox has any delusions that they [[01:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3868.48s)]
*  would control me because they sell ads for me in this new context. But it's delightful to be able [[01:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3873.36s)]
*  to not worry about people like that, you know, and, and you guys know, maybe you don't know, [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3879.44s)]
*  because I know you had lean years, we talked about Chamath worked at Burger King when he was a kid. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3883.12s)]
*  But, you know, after Fox and NBC, both of those organizations tried to destroy me, 100% tried to [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3887.52s)]
*  destroy me. And you have those nights in your bed where you're kind of like sad and your career's [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3894.0s)]
*  blown up and you're like, Jesus, and bit by bit, then you build it back. And the last thing you [[01:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3898.72s)]
*  want is for somebody to come in and be like, oh, she sold out. She sold out to one of them. Like, [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3905.2s)]
*  in the end, she bent the knee and went back. That's not at all what happened. I had nothing [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3909.36s)]
*  to do with this. It wasn't my decision. And when I tweeted that out, again, not trying to antagonize [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3912.96s)]
*  Fox, I see why they're smart to have made this move, just setting the record straight. But that's, [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3918.56s)]
*  when I tweeted it out, you guys won't be surprised to learn everybody, every one of the people who [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3923.68s)]
*  follows me on Twitter was like, we got your back. We get it. We knew it. We don't worry. [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3928.8s)]
*  It was just a brand new world. Can I, can I make a prediction? Just three legs of the stool, Megan, [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3934.48s)]
*  you have two of them and you got half a one. You got to make that last leg of the stool [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3940.64s)]
*  very strong. I agree with that. We, Chamath and I, we brainstormed and we built this infrastructure [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3945.44s)]
*  inside of All In so that we never have to bend the knee and we have the FU money and the FU platform. [[01:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3950.88s)]
*  There's, there's a picture, I don't know if Allison, you can find it, but there's a picture [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3957.04s)]
*  of SpaceX's engines. They're, they're the Raptor engines and they're, they're sitting side by each. [[01:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3961.2799999999997s)]
*  Okay. Raptor one, then Raptor version two, then Raptor version three. And I think what's happening [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3968.4s)]
*  in the creator economy is very akin to that picture, which is that if you're going to build [[01:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3975.36s)]
*  something real, and I think the creator economy is real because mainstream media is decaying. [[01:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3981.28s)]
*  To build something real takes at least 15 years. There's no shortcuts. There's nothing you can do [[01:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3987.2000000000003s)]
*  about it. And what happens is the first version, all it has to do is just kind of work and hang [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3991.84s)]
*  together. And a lot of people will dunk on you. And a lot of people will think that you're still [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=3998.32s)]
*  kind of, you know, wasting your time or you're working on a pet project or whatever, but you're [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4004.0s)]
*  not. Because the minute you get that version one working and you've gotten version one working, [[01:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4008.56s)]
*  Tucker has, Ezra Kelly has kind of, but he should really leave the New York Times and do it on his [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4013.84s)]
*  own or Ezra Klein, sorry. What you are then allowed to do is work on version two and version [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4018.56s)]
*  two is the first version of it that's like a real thing that can stand alone. And then four or five [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4025.92s)]
*  years later, you get to this version three and that is just excellence. And that's when everybody [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4032.32s)]
*  else goes out of business. And I see this pattern in so many businesses. It's going to happen in [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4036.8s)]
*  this creator economy. So you, Mr. Beast, us, Tucker, you know, we're on version one. It's very rough [[01:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4043.12s)]
*  around the edges. People are figuring it out. We're all going to make mistakes. But that version [[01:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4051.92s)]
*  two is when there's going to be this meaningful downtick in the New York Times, in the Washington [[01:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4056.48s)]
*  Post, in the Wall Street Journal. By the way, like, you know, I said this, I had probably 15 [[01:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4062.0s)]
*  media subscriptions. I'm down to one, which is the Wall Street Journal. And I'm looking for every [[01:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4067.36s)]
*  reason to just dump it. And for me, it's the anxiety of there's probably some financial news [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4072.88s)]
*  that I will miss and I won't really get on X or with the with the other places. But the minute [[01:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4079.68s)]
*  I feel like I can, I will now version two has to solve a much bigger problem, though, which is in [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4084.24s)]
*  once we're all out there making opinions. The other problem that it will highlight is that the [[01:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4089.2799999999997s)]
*  algorithms are brittle. And we're going to have to figure out how well how is our information getting [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4095.44s)]
*  in front of the right people? And how do we make sure that it's not just a bunch of million echo [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4103.5199999999995s)]
*  chambers so that we are we become fragmented? That's not solved, because right now we go into [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4108.4s)]
*  a centralized algorithm, right? Everything goes into one version inside of meta or inside of X or [[01:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4113.36s)]
*  inside of Google. And we're going to adjacent stocked about this before, which is this idea [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4119.839999999999s)]
*  like there should be a marketplace and a competition for these algorithms as well. That's the next part [[01:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4124.0s)]
*  of fixing the media cycle, you know, because some people may literally want to just stay in a [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4130.08s)]
*  partisan bubble. But some people want the media diet to be balanced. How do you get that today? [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4135.2s)]
*  It's impossible. It's funny, because I was speaking with a very smart person about YouTube [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4140.0s)]
*  algorithms. And this person doesn't work for YouTube. But I was saying, Well, how do you know, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4144.4s)]
*  how can the Megan Kelly show go from three and a half million subscribers to 20 million subscribers, [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4150.24s)]
*  and it later became clear to me this person was of the left. And of course, his answer was, [[01:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4155.12s)]
*  you have to be more moderate, put on more Democrats, you know, like, reach across the aisle. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4160.72s)]
*  I'm like, Okay, how can we do it without me changing my business model, because I must be [[01:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4167.84s)]
*  honest. And I don't think the secret to my next level success is to populate the show with a bunch [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4173.04s)]
*  of leftists. But I do I do have a lot of Democrats on the show. But the answer is not to change [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4179.68s)]
*  anything about my content. It's to make sure the algorithm picks up the most important thing in [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4185.36s)]
*  media. And I told this to my to my squad on all in, when I was, you know, in the early days, [[01:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4192.5599999999995s)]
*  it was just hard to get these guys to show up every week. And I just sat them all down. I said, [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4198.08s)]
*  guys, the number one way to be successful in media is to show up every day, consistency. [[01:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4202.32s)]
*  And that's what you have. You are a juggernaut, you show up every day, you're consistent. And I [[01:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4208.639999999999s)]
*  subscribe to you. Congratulations on breaking 3 million. That's extraordinary in a short period [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4215.44s)]
*  of time. Consistency is the key. And when we started out, you know, some free bird can't make [[01:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4219.04s)]
*  this day, Chamath can't make this day, whatever. Now, nobody misses every Thursday, it's locked in. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4225.839999999999s)]
*  Nobody misses whether I'm in Japan scheme, Italy, we're all in. And that's the way to do it. And [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4232.32s)]
*  hey, when are we going to get this Megyn Kelly con? That's what you need to do. MK con with the [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4238.48s)]
*  G and T's. Sell 1000 tickets, get all your fans there. I would come to MK con. [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4243.28s)]
*  This is where Jason just embarrasses himself. He just starts off so strong. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4248.719999999999s)]
*  I have ideas. I have ideas for Megan. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4252.639999999999s)]
*  If you have to grab your performance on the show, it starts off and then it just crashes. [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4254.719999999999s)]
*  I'm feeling really good about our relationship though. I feel like my relationship with Jay [[01:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4261.12s)]
*  Cal has come full circle. Look at us now. It really is about time. [[01:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4264.639999999999s)]
*  Guys, there's a just just to clean up on this. There's an incredible paper [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4268.88s)]
*  published by TikTok, the engineers at TikTok about how they do personalization and their algorithm. [[01:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4275.5199999999995s)]
*  And this is what made me think about this, which is why don't I have the choice to opt into it? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4282.24s)]
*  Now, the interesting thing that they do that nobody else does is no matter what your content [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4286.96s)]
*  preferences are, they will always see you with something that's a little bit off topic slash [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4292.48s)]
*  off brand slash off interest, because they're always trying to get this, you know, this more [[01:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4299.839999999999s)]
*  visceral reaction to do you engage in it or not. And it's just an insight to me that even if you are [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4305.599999999999s)]
*  one way, the most valuable algorithms that we all need to make content on top of need to get that [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4312.5599999999995s)]
*  right, which is how do you expose it, even if you're exposing it to someone that just viscerally [[01:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4319.36s)]
*  disagrees, but it just makes the content more valuable and it makes the service better. And [[01:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4324.5599999999995s)]
*  I think that that's that's like the next big turn. That's the version two of that Raptor engine [[01:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4329.44s)]
*  that we all need to get right. That makes a lot of sense. I mean, [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4334.24s)]
*  it's been interesting the past couple of years on Facebook, D emphasized news, you know, it used to [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4336.88s)]
*  be such an important platform for people who are in news really kind of before we all came into this [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4342.5599999999995s)]
*  space. It was very important. Like for Ben, I know when he was building his show, it was extremely [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4347.6s)]
*  important to Facebook. And then they just decided in the wake of all their wokeism and their annoying [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4352.4800000000005s)]
*  politics, that they were going to stop platforming news. And people kind of lost their newsfeed. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4356.8s)]
*  A lot of people who use Facebook for news lost their newsfeed. And for us, we just started using [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4362.240000000001s)]
*  Facebook to promote our more cultural content. We do a lot of cultural segments on the show. [[01:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4367.6s)]
*  And that wound up working out fine for us because that works very well on Facebook. [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4371.84s)]
*  Facebook likes those segments. They'll recirculate them a lot. It is it you know, [[01:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4376.8s)]
*  it's alternative content in the way you just described. My wife and I went down the rabbit [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4381.6s)]
*  hole of the Blake Lively Justin Baldoni thing. And you're saying your rabbit hole. Yeah, you got [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4386.0s)]
*  like we lived inside of your clips for a while. Those were living rent free in our head. [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4391.52s)]
*  Just I like Brian, Brian Friedman all the time. And I predict it's not going to end well for Blake [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4397.4400000000005s)]
*  Lively. I don't think I think this will not go to trial. It's been set for trial March of 26. [[01:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4403.44s)]
*  There's no way they're going to let this she's going to let this go to trial because she really [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4409.04s)]
*  will turn into Amber Heard, who had to leave the United States after that trial against Johnny [[01:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4411.839999999999s)]
*  Depp. Did you guys watch? Did you guys watch the movie? Did you guys like the movie? [[01:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4416.32s)]
*  I did not watch the movie nor do I have any desire. I hate is just you know why it's so [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4420.639999999999s)]
*  contentious, Megan, because there's so little at stake. There's so little at stake in this [[01:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4425.28s)]
*  Blake Lively. I mean, this is like who cares? It's a bunch of like, you know, [[01:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4430.96s)]
*  Hollywood people fighting. It's a curtain. That's why it is so interesting. Oh, like, [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4435.84s)]
*  I guess the PR stuff she truly I know this gets overused now, but she did FAFO like she thought [[01:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4441.44s)]
*  she could blame all of her negative press on him. He's a weakling. She's Blake Lively with [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4447.2s)]
*  Ryan Reynolds, her dragon. And she decided I can't take one month worth of negative press, [[01:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4451.52s)]
*  which she got, you know, generated, she says by him, he says by you and your badness. And she's [[01:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4460.0s)]
*  so thin skinned, you know, like, look, look, what happens to look what happened to poor J Cali even [[01:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4466.16s)]
*  on this show, people get picked on when they're in the public eye. Right? Like, look at Google, [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4470.0s)]
*  Megan Kelly, you'll see terrible articles about me. It's part of being in the public eye. She's [[01:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4475.92s)]
*  just used to being Hollywood's golden girl. And she had such thin skin that after being having a [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4480.88s)]
*  couple of negative things happen to her for a month, she had to blame him. She decided to blame [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4486.32s)]
*  him. And boy, does she open up a hornet's nest and learn you be careful what you wish for because [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4490.0s)]
*  now you've got the fight you asked for and you're not winning it. I love I love my jaders that my [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4496.24s)]
*  jaders make me greater. I love them. That's that's Raiders. The jaders. I love it. You branded the [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4502.48s)]
*  people that that Oh, absolutely. I mean, how do you think I have so many followers? How all these [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4508.719999999999s)]
*  people who hate me, they all follow me. That's the thing. You know, David, it's so funny, I was [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4514.16s)]
*  never into politics. David inserted politics into the all in pockets because it's his passion. And [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4524.0s)]
*  I've actually enjoyed, you know, sparring with him over it, refining my positions on it, maybe [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4530.0s)]
*  think about it in a much deeper way, because I just never liked it. And, you know, we have these like [[01:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4536.0s)]
*  grand debates on Putin in Ukraine. And, you know, who's first heard Shumat's name early on, you were [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4542.32s)]
*  early to say, I just I'm sorry, but I don't care. Like, it's, you know, you know, my line very [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4549.679999999999s)]
*  plainly. But frankly, most of the country landed where you were then, like, it's not that we don't [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4554.5599999999995s)]
*  care at all about what happened to Ukrainian people. But it's like, we have our own problems. [[01:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4561.5199999999995s)]
*  We can't keep throwing good money after bad on that conflict. And don't you think that's what [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4566.24s)]
*  Trump's really been saying these past couple of days? And Hegsteth has been saying like, look, [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4570.8s)]
*  it's got to end. It's we of course, Russia is going to have territory. They're not getting [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4575.04s)]
*  Ukraine's not getting back its entire borders. And obviously, Ukraine's not joining NATO peep [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4581.68s)]
*  Hegsteth got a hard time from the press for actually saying that. But we all know that it's [[01:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4587.52s)]
*  like, is it really give up the farm when we all know that? No, I think he said the quiet part out [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4591.6s)]
*  loud and you weren't allowed to say it because it was, you know, almost like some it was like a [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4598.08s)]
*  virtue signaling test, you know, you have to maintain this line, even though everybody behind [[01:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4603.84s)]
*  the scenes already knew to your point, the answer. I mean, the the crazy thing about Russia, Ukraine [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4609.76s)]
*  is a couple things. One is, you know, it pulled us in to a situation where the Europeans really [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4614.72s)]
*  should have been taking the lead. And instead, you know, we had to have the opinion then we became [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4623.92s)]
*  the major funder. It turns out we sent, you know, 200 plus billion dollars of which at least 100 [[01:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4628.400000000001s)]
*  billion has gotten completely misplaced, which is unbelievable. And it just goes to show you that [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4633.76s)]
*  you can't even have a conversation about what's right or wrong. And so now, you know, do we need [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4640.64s)]
*  to audit what happened over there? Probably. Do we need a resolution? Yeah, instantly. And I would [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4644.88s)]
*  rather us be able to take our mental energy and focus it internally. And I think that we weren't [[01:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4651.52s)]
*  allowed to say that to your point. When I said that it was really more in the context of China and, [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4657.360000000001s)]
*  you know, some of the things that are going on in China, but it also applied to Ukraine and [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4662.160000000001s)]
*  applied to many things. And, you know, people tried to cancel me. And I thought, wow, this is crazy. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4666.72s)]
*  And now it looks like, you know, most Americans, I think, to your point, [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4673.76s)]
*  believe that the right thing to do is just to focus internally and get our house in order. [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4677.68s)]
*  Yeah. The great thing about Trump. Trump said yesterday, he had direct talks with Putin [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4682.08s)]
*  that he thinks that he's ready to make a deal. He did it without Zelensky. [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4686.08s)]
*  Zelensky, people said, how could you do it without Zelensky? He said, I got to find out first whether [[01:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4690.08s)]
*  Putin wants to make a deal. Now I know he does want to make a deal. And then I talked to Zelensky, [[01:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4694.400000000001s)]
*  who also wants to make a deal. He doesn't think that Zelensky doesn't think that Putin genuinely [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4698.64s)]
*  wants to make a deal. But Trump's like, we're going to make a deal. All right. [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4703.6s)]
*  And no one's going to walk away thrilled, but we're not going to keep funding this thing. [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4706.64s)]
*  And Hegseth said, we're definitely not going to have American boots on the ground over there [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4712.0s)]
*  maintaining security. That's going to have to be Europe. And the Europeans are like, why [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4715.360000000001s)]
*  weren't we on the call? It's like, there's only one person who can get this done. [[01:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4719.200000000001s)]
*  And he happens to be in the White House Oval. And he'll get it done. The Europeans will provide [[01:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4723.68s)]
*  the security for it. He secured all that money that Ukraine took from us with Earth materials [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4728.16s)]
*  that we need that are in Ukraine. It's the one thing they can give to us. Right? He finally got [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4735.28s)]
*  us something for all this money. Here's the thing, Biden, and I brought this up countless times with [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4739.84s)]
*  Sachs, and we had this very vibrant debate on it where I said, listen, this is a loan lease. Like, [[01:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4744.32s)]
*  they are buying these weapons on loan and they have to pay it back. And Sachs was like, you know, [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4749.84s)]
*  to his credit, like, that's never going to happen. Biden's never going to ask for the money back. [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4754.16s)]
*  It's going to be a donation. We all know that. You know, Trump comes in, he cares about money. [[01:19:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4757.52s)]
*  He cares about the balance sheet. He knows we have issues around our solvency. And he said, [[01:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4761.92s)]
*  you know what? I want the money back. It's a loan lease, which is what we did during World War II. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4766.96s)]
*  And Ukraine's going to pay every dollar back. If Ukraine pays every dollar back, [[01:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4772.080000000001s)]
*  we do a 10, 20 year, you know, Ukraine can't join NATO for 10 years, no big deal. We could outlast [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4776.400000000001s)]
*  Putin. And that's the thing you have to realize about these dictators. You know, they have a [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4783.040000000001s)]
*  certain lifespan. They typically implode. They cause their own problems as Putin and Xi and [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4786.88s)]
*  North Korea have done. The best thing is to contain them. And you know who's great at [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4792.08s)]
*  containing them and managing them? Trump. They respect him. He's a strong man. He's crazy. [[01:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4796.0s)]
*  He's Captain Chaos. He's saber rattles. He threatens them. They respect him. And they're a little [[01:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4801.92s)]
*  scared of him, I think. And if he gets all that money back from Ukraine, we will have protected [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4806.96s)]
*  democracy. We will have contained Putin and you know, all's well that ends well. So I really hope [[01:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4811.76s)]
*  and I actually think Trump's going to pull it off and I would give him a lot of credit when he does. [[01:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4818.08s)]
*  I think we have a lot of good news. I mean, as good as we could ask for [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4822.16s)]
*  when it comes to wrapping up that conflict, because it's just it's got to it's got to end. [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4826.0s)]
*  It's just at this point, the long give us our money back. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4829.76s)]
*  Long tail of that conflict, though, guys, is going to play out over many decades in Europe. [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4832.8s)]
*  I think that, you know, the question is, well, can Europe change the playbook, meaning, [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4837.04s)]
*  you know, in the middle of that conflict to basically just torpedo their ability to actually [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4841.92s)]
*  import energy to then still continue down the path of turning off domestic nuclear. [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4846.64s)]
*  France was the only one that basically said this is crazy. I'm not going to do it. [[01:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4852.0s)]
*  And then have to import all this energy from all over the world at all these exorbitant prices. [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4856.24s)]
*  At the same time, the economy is sort of very fragile, like the European continent is in [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4861.36s)]
*  a lot of trouble. And these last three or four years have actually added a lot of fuel to the [[01:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4865.84s)]
*  fire. So I think like, you know, smart people need to have a better opportunity to just like, [[01:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4871.6s)]
*  be smart and public and then have the public be able to absorb that and actually make decisions. [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4878.56s)]
*  That's why these things are nuts. Like what's happened is crazy. [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4884.72s)]
*  That's a good transition smart people saying smart things to JD Vance back in Munich. [[01:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4888.24s)]
*  Oh, yeah. [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4892.88s)]
*  With a truth bomb in front of the Europeans who were reportedly just stunned in their seats, [[01:21:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4893.44s)]
*  uncomfortable shuffling when it comes to free speech, which is, I mean, Europe has just been [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4901.04s)]
*  absolutely abysmal on and immigration, which to take what I said about free speech times 10. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4906.719999999999s)]
*  So the sitting vice president of the United States goes over there. These are allies. Yes. [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4914.0s)]
*  But man, he did not mince words. Here's a little of JD Vance in Munich yesterday. [[01:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4918.0s)]
*  I've heard a lot about what you need to defend yourselves from. And of course, that's important. [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4924.4800000000005s)]
*  But what has seemed a little bit less clear to me, and certainly I think to many of the citizens [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4930.16s)]
*  of Europe, is what exactly it is that you're defending yourselves for. What is the positive [[01:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4935.52s)]
*  vision that animates this shared security compact that we all believe is so important? [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4941.6s)]
*  And I believe deeply that there is no security if you are afraid of the voices, the opinions, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4948.08s)]
*  and the conscience that guide your very own people. Europe faces many challenges, [[01:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4956.4s)]
*  but the crisis this continent faces right now, the crisis I believe we all face together, [[01:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4963.2s)]
*  is one of our own making. If you're running in fear of your own voters, there is nothing [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4968.8s)]
*  America can do for you. Nor for that matter, is there anything that you can do for the American [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4976.24s)]
*  people who elected me and elected President Trump? Sorry, that was earlier today, but it's amazing to [[01:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4981.679999999999s)]
*  hear him say it, no? I think so. I think he has to basically set this agenda very, very clearly. [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4990.16s)]
*  Europeans are going to be at the forefront of like this next phase of very difficult [[01:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=4997.12s)]
*  decision making. I'll give you one example. The amount of rules and regulations that they make [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5001.52s)]
*  around climate change and the impact that it has economically all over the world, including [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5007.040000000001s)]
*  domestically in their own countries. How are they going to deal with that now that we have to [[01:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5012.8s)]
*  recognize nothing the Europeans do actually has a meaningful impact on climate. Whether you agree [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5017.76s)]
*  with it or not agree with it, it's irrelevant. You need to look at China and India. That's where the [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5023.6s)]
*  whole game is played. So if you can't say that inside of Europe, inside of the borders of Europe, [[01:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5028.56s)]
*  how will you ever change the rules? That's an example. A second example, there is not a single [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5034.240000000001s)]
*  company that's getting started today that has a desire to locate an office directly inside of the [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5039.280000000001s)]
*  UK or Europe. Why? Because the regulatory framework will now come and really go after you if they [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5044.64s)]
*  don't like a single thing that you're doing. So what now happens to the European economy, [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5050.56s)]
*  they get deprived of their chance of having some small modicum of technological supremacy. [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5054.72s)]
*  What do you think happens to those economies? So if you add all of these things up, it all goes [[01:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5060.56s)]
*  back to the root cause that JD is identifying. If you can't say it, you can't fix it. And so they [[01:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5065.12s)]
*  have to decide what page they're on. And it's even worse than that, Jamath, if you think about [[01:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5071.68s)]
*  the fact that they're not content to just have this regulation impact their citizens and to make [[01:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5076.320000000001s)]
*  unbelievably stupid decisions like the Germans turning off three of their remaining nuclear [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5082.0s)]
*  reactors and then building a pipeline from a dictator to buy oil directly from Russia. [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5088.0s)]
*  The French figured it out. They were 90% at the peak nuclear. Now they're about 60 and about 20% [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5093.84s)]
*  renewables. They're totally energy independent. The European Union wants to regulate American [[01:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5099.280000000001s)]
*  companies. We have companies like Adobe wanted to buy a tiny company called Figma for 10, 20 [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5106.96s)]
*  billion dollars. You know who stopped it? It was the Europeans. It was the UK. It was the UK. [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5112.88s)]
*  Yeah, they're going after our companies and what we're doing. My advice to those companies were, [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5120.32s)]
*  you know what, if you're Adobe or Figma, stop selling your product in the UK. Block the UK. [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5125.36s)]
*  It's a meaningless market. They're so deranged with the regulations. They want to have them apply [[01:25:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5130.56s)]
*  to the rest of the world and to Trimont's point. Elon was battling this when it comes to free speech [[01:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5136.64s)]
*  and X in Europe. And the free speech battle, I mean, it's a reminder of why we left England, [[01:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5142.56s)]
*  why we, as Americans said, you know what? The most important thing to us, amendment number one, [[01:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5149.04s)]
*  is free speech and they don't have it anymore. It's all but dead in Europe. There was a great [[01:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5155.76s)]
*  tablet magazine piece. I actually just pulled it in advance of today. And it's written by a guy [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5160.4s)]
*  named Paul de Quinoa and he goes on about what just happened in Germany with this compact magazine [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5167.839999999999s)]
*  and how there's a rule in Germany. There's a law that says that they can shut you down. They can [[01:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5175.04s)]
*  shut your speech down if they think that it is inconsistent with their constitutional order, [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5181.92s)]
*  the constitutional order of their country. And so they went in, they think this is a quote, [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5188.64s)]
*  far right magazine because it supports this ADL party, sorry, AFD party that is very anti-illegal [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5192.96s)]
*  immigration. And they went in, they seized, they have like 40,000 subscribers. They seized the [[01:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5200.96s)]
*  offices. They basically took over control of the whole thing and shut it down from publishing. [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5207.6s)]
*  The thought of that happening in the United States, I mean, there would be a full revolt, [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5212.96s)]
*  I'd like to think. So he's speaking to the right audience there. They do need to hear it. And I'll [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5220.08s)]
*  just give you one more sound bite before I give it back to you. You mentioned their insane green [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5225.2s)]
*  energy commitment at the expense of their own people. JD tied that and the free speech together [[01:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5230.72s)]
*  in South 30 and expressing opinions. Isn't election interference. Even when people express [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5237.28s)]
*  views outside your own country, and even when those people are very influential and trust me, [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5244.0s)]
*  I say this with all humor. If American democracy can survive 10 years of Greta Thunberg scolding, [[01:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5250.72s)]
*  you guys can survive a few months of Elon Musk. What no democracy American, German or European [[01:27:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5257.679999999999s)]
*  will survive is telling millions of voters that their thoughts and concerns their aspirations, [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5263.52s)]
*  their pleas for relief are invalid or unworthy of even being considered. [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5269.280000000001s)]
*  This is he's completely right. I'll give you an example of this. You know, I've I've been to 10 [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5277.120000000001s)]
*  downing a couple of times in the last four or five years, with all of the relationships that I've [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5282.64s)]
*  tried to build in Europe and in the UK. I think Greta Thunberg has met with more of the leaders [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5289.84s)]
*  there than I have multiplied by like 10. Now, that's fine and good for Greta Thunberg. But [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5297.68s)]
*  I think the point is that there there was just this incredible animated energy to wrap yourself [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5303.84s)]
*  around these moral ideals without questioning whether they were legitimate. And I don't exactly [[01:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5311.04s)]
*  know why it happened or where it came from. But JD is right, if you you need at some point, [[01:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5315.68s)]
*  you just kind of rip the bandaid off and course, correct. And I think Europe's at that moment, [[01:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5321.76s)]
*  America is at that moment. Yes, we're clearly doing it. And you can tell that they are just [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5326.400000000001s)]
*  so viscerally concerned. And it just it really pushes against the grain of 20 or 30 years of [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5332.56s)]
*  embedded behavior. But I think Europeans are capable of it. They just need to figure out that [[01:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5339.12s)]
*  it's existential as well for them. I think they're starting to feel it though, in the same way we [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5343.92s)]
*  reached our boiling point and reelected Trump. You know, the the woman JD mentioned a different [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5347.92s)]
*  man who was arrested for praying outside of an abortion clinic. I remember this video. It's a [[01:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5353.92s)]
*  woman. Her name was Isabel von Spruce. She was silently praying guys in her head. She's sitting [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5358.88s)]
*  there silently praying they can't come over and say, What are you praying in your head? What are [[01:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5367.12s)]
*  you doing? She's like, I'm silently praying in my head outside of an abortion clinic, you have to [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5372.08s)]
*  go. They arrested her. That's what it's come to across the pond. And you know, a distant relative [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5376.72s)]
*  now of the United States, we don't I don't think we can really even understand this. Although, [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5384.32s)]
*  we're getting a little dangerously close in incident after incident in throwing the book [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5389.5199999999995s)]
*  at people who are praying outside of abortion clinics here, to the point where Trump had to [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5395.12s)]
*  pardon some of them. You know, it's not nearly as bad as it is overseas. But I think you're right. [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5399.68s)]
*  What do you think, Jay Cal, that they're reaching their breaking point? The the citizenry [[01:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5404.320000000001s)]
*  has had enough of this. I don't know where America, you know, or how we got onto this like weird [[01:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5408.64s)]
*  side quest that we had to police speech when I grew up, UCLA was out there saying, we're going [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5414.96s)]
*  to let the Ku Klux Klan march down, you know, Main Street, because that's better to defend [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5420.240000000001s)]
*  uncomfortable speech than lose freedom of speech. It's a reason why we believe that 100%. That was [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5426.32s)]
*  a democratic position, in fact, and by the way, the border, it was the Republicans position. But [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5433.84s)]
*  1520 years ago that we should have an open border, because they wanted to reap the benefits of NAFTA [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5440.48s)]
*  and free trade. So these parties have just flip flopped their positions. And the idea that [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5445.759999999999s)]
*  Americans can't say what they want, even if it's unpopular is crazy. You look at you brought up [[01:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5452.24s)]
*  Zuckerberg before he was more than willing under Biden, Kamala, everybody to ban speech on his [[01:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5456.32s)]
*  platform. YouTube would put warnings on the all in podcasts when we talked about the science behind [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5464.0s)]
*  COVID. Like, yeah, you really need to give people a warning. Like, Friedberg's a scientist, like, [[01:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5470.96s)]
*  we're gonna you're warning people blocking content, it makes no sense. If Kanye West as [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5477.44s)]
*  but one recent example is a racist mentally ill, whatever he is, and he posts crazy stuff, [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5483.36s)]
*  we can all see it. Now we know. Kanye is mentally ill and or he's a huge fan of Hitler's. Great. [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5488.639999999999s)]
*  Now we know we don't have to do business with him. I always love the fact that these idiot, [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5495.04s)]
*  racist lunatics without themselves. That's good. And it's good for our kids and everybody else to [[01:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5500.799999999999s)]
*  see, hey, here's racist people, they here's racist, evil people, they exist in the world, [[01:31:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5506.16s)]
*  they're nuts. There they are. And you can ignore them, you can change the channel. If you don't [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5510.8s)]
*  like what somebody's saying, you can listen or you can create your own media today and counter it, [[01:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5516.24s)]
*  you could write an essay, you could do your own monologue on your own podcast. And, you know, [[01:32:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5520.96s)]
*  why why silence people? I don't I don't understand what the point is. It basically says to me, [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5527.12s)]
*  you can't win the argument, or you're not willing to engage the argument. You're too scared. [[01:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5531.76s)]
*  I agree with you on Kanye. I think he's or yea, he's now in the middle of another mental health [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5536.16s)]
*  episode. I think that's what this bizarre latest behavior is. It is sad. I've said along, I don't [[01:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5541.28s)]
*  understand. People should stop platforming him like this. Like, you know, like he during his last [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5546.4s)]
*  meltdown, he was on News Nation. And it was like, don't don't try to monetize his mental break, [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5553.04s)]
*  which is very clear. He's in the midst of we all know he's got this issue. [[01:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5558.639999999999s)]
*  It's so interesting you bring this point up as a broadcaster, broadcasted broadcaster. I had a [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5562.320000000001s)]
*  conversation with Lex, and I was talking to Lex, he's like, should I have Kanye on? I'm going to [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5566.56s)]
*  try to get through to him. I said, Lex, you're a great interviewer. We're friends. He's mentally [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5569.92s)]
*  ill. And you're going to platform, I guarantee you, in the first hour or two, he's going to say [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5577.200000000001s)]
*  something so crazy, and then you're going to be responsible for propagating it. [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5581.68s)]
*  Guys, where's the balance between free speech and platforming and de platforming then? [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5584.96s)]
*  If you know the person's got mental illness, I mean, how do you know, Jason? Have you watched [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5589.2s)]
*  him? And have you heard his family say he's having an episode? Kim Kardashian says he's bipolar, [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5595.12s)]
*  and she was married to him for what, 10 years? Like, I take her at a word on that. [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5600.24s)]
*  And I know he's denied it. I should say that. But it does seem he goes through these bouts of very [[01:33:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5604.72s)]
*  bizarre behavior that don't necessarily match up with how he is the rest of the time. Maybe it's [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5610.0s)]
*  just him. If there's any doubt about the mental wellness of the person, I wouldn't put him on. [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5615.12s)]
*  I would be too worried about exploiting a weak moment, like a low moment for the person mentally. [[01:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5620.16s)]
*  In the same way that you can't, I don't know if you guys have ever had somebody that you know, [[01:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5626.4s)]
*  a friend or family who's actually dealing with mental illness, you can't get through to them. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5629.92s)]
*  You can't say, you're having a mental episode. Please stop saying that. They're not reachable. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5635.04s)]
*  So it's kind of like the whole thing is pointless other than for just like a voyeurism sake. [[01:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5640.88s)]
*  All right, stand by. I've got to take an ad break. And I'll be right back because there's [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5645.84s)]
*  something I cannot let you go without asking you. We continue to face uncertainty when it comes to [[01:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5649.84s)]
*  the economy with a perfect storm brewing as Social Security and Medicare hit a breaking point, [[01:34:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5654.88s)]
*  as the largest generation is hitting retirement. A smaller workforce means a smaller tax base. [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5659.92s)]
*  You pair that with our growing national debt and rising cost of living, and we could have a very [[01:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5664.72s)]
*  big problem on our hands. So what are you doing now to protect your family for the future? [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5668.48s)]

*  So there's another podcast with the very annoying Kara Swisher and her partner Scott Galloway. [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5778.8s)]
*  I know that decided it would be a great idea to arrest the Doge workers under Elon. I mean, [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5786.320000000001s)]
*  Scott Galloway openly called for them to be arrested. And Elon responded on X saying Swisher [[01:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5792.88s)]
*  and Galloway are threatening talented young software engineers who gave up high compensation [[01:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5798.64s)]
*  for death threats in order to help the American people. Shame on them. Swisher and Galloway, [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5802.88s)]
*  cruel, mean and deceitful human beings that they are. Then those two went back on their podcast [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5808.0s)]
*  and said the following in Sat 10. Like they traded it because this is what they want to do. And they [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5813.44s)]
*  were enthusiastically doing it. And we don't have to like them. And just by not liking them, [[01:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5819.36s)]
*  we're not threatening them. So that's fucking nonsense. And neither you didn't threaten them [[01:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5824.4s)]
*  in any way. And it's a larger part of the strategy of intimidating journalists. They're trying, he's [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5828.16s)]
*  trying to shut us up. He's going to strong me of overreach. Yeah, then come after me, bitch. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5833.52s)]
*  To go after the woman. Yeah, it shows one or two things either you're weak, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5841.040000000001s)]
*  or you're having incredible bias. I misogynist. Let's just get to the source here. It's just so [[01:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5845.76s)]
*  clear the guy wants to fuck me. I mean, that's what I said. The sexual tension is I get it. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5851.68s)]
*  And he's rich. So there is a shot here. What is that? I mean, it's irrelevant. [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5858.08s)]
*  You explain to me. That's Kara Swisher. She says she's the tech journalist. She's the one who [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5865.599999999999s)]
*  covers your industry better than anyone. You know, she was, I was friendly with her for a long time [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5871.2s)]
*  with Karen Swisher. I'm sorry, Karen. Same. And you know, she kind of when she was with [[01:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5877.5199999999995s)]
*  Walt Mossberg, you know, she really focused on the tech, the business. She was a little spicy [[01:38:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5883.68s)]
*  on the margins as a broadcaster. But when she partnered with Scott Galloway, the whole thing [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5887.84s)]
*  went really dark. And, you know, he I have some sympathy for him. He's talked about mental illness, [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5892.240000000001s)]
*  depression, whatever, very publicly on his podcast. And, you know, I think he's so desperate to, [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5897.360000000001s)]
*  you know, get ratings. And they're making, you know, decent money, I think, from their podcast, [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5903.92s)]
*  they've been talking about, you know, they're making eight figures with their new deal or whatever. [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5908.56s)]
*  They just do Elon for clicks, right? In the NBA, I'm a Nick fan, we have an expression, [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5912.64s)]
*  Nick's for clicks. You get a lot of clicks if you talk about the Knicks, because it's a big market, [[01:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5917.68s)]
*  you get a lot of views if you trash Elon. But, you know, I do think, you know, they're saying [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5921.4400000000005s)]
*  some things that are truly offensive, and then which is fine. But he also was like making jokes [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5927.2s)]
*  about Trump being assassinated. I thought that was incredibly poor taste, like you really shouldn't [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5933.12s)]
*  make jokes about the, you know, potential assassination of the president. [[01:38:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5938.8s)]
*  Actually, this president. [[01:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5942.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's like happened twice. And, you know, I think he's off the deep end, you know, people [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5944.639999999999s)]
*  send me clips and they go viral and stuff like that. She's making a cottage industry out of being [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5950.8s)]
*  this alleged Elon expert because she's interviewed him. I mean, so has Don Lemon, doesn't make him an [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5956.32s)]
*  Elon expert. [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5962.24s)]
*  I was with Elon, like the two or three times she interviewed him, like, because we're friends and [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5963.92s)]
*  we hang and it's irrelevant. And, you know, like trading on other people's brand, like, just go [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5968.24s)]
*  build something in the world, go do something yourself. And I think these commenters are [[01:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5975.28s)]
*  not actually in the arena, as my friend Chamath likes to say, they're not building something. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5980.16s)]
*  So they just want to tear people down. And it's good for ratings or whatever. But it just seems [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5984.08s)]
*  super illogical because to what we're just talking about with Germany and Europe, they're [[01:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5988.24s)]
*  just out of sync with how people think. We have bigger problems. They're super out of sync. And [[01:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5994.08s)]
*  they're not objective. You know, I can come on here and I can talk about, hey, here's where we [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=5999.12s)]
*  differ in the border. And you can have an intelligent conversation about it. I think they're [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6003.28s)]
*  just off the deep end with Elon derangement syndrome, Trump derangement syndrome. I think [[01:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6006.8s)]
*  they're just really scared of what's going to happen during this presidency. I can tell you [[01:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6011.04s)]
*  what's going to happen during this presidency. Exactly what happened the last time. It's going [[01:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6016.0s)]
*  to be a bit chaotic. Stock market's going to go up. We're going to balance the budget a bit. [[01:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6018.8s)]
*  He'll stop the wars. He's good at not starting wars and he's good at stopping them. And I think [[01:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6023.68s)]
*  it will be a relatively successful presidency and then somebody else will win and life will go on. [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6027.84s)]
*  This idea that Trump's going to destroy the world is crazy. He destroyed the world last time. [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6033.6s)]
*  They're calling JD 48, which I like and fully support. I got to run. I'm up against the clock, [[01:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6039.52s)]
*  you guys. What a pleasure. Thanks so much for coming on together. This was fun. [[01:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6045.04s)]

*  Absolutely. You're booked. Consider yourselves booked. See you next year. See you next year. [[01:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V0MUmK9wQfA&t=6054.88s)]
