Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Andrew Klavan, host of The Daily Wire's "Andrew Klavan Show,” to discuss President Trump delivering on his promise to protect womens' and girls' sports, his monumental executive order banning biological males from female sports, why it marks a cultural turning point for protecting women, the false divide between men and women, how Trump’s unmatched resilience changed the Republican party, his "fight, fight, fight" mentality after the first assassination attempt, what we learned from the FCC publishing the transcript and raw footage from Kamala Harris' "60 Minutes" interview, the painful moments for Kamala that CBS News edited out, how legacy media lost the trust of the public, and more. Then U.S. Senator Ron Johnson joins to discuss Robert F. Kennedy Jr.'s upcoming senate confirmation vote for HHS Secretary, whether any GOP senators might vote against him and any Democratic senators will vote for him, why he’s the right person to take on corporate interests, the absurdity of RFK's confirmation hearings, and more. Then Chuck Zito, actor and stuntman, joins to discuss his experience in the Hell's Angels infamous motorcycle club, growing up and getting introduced to martial arts, the infamous altercation with Jean-Claude Van Damme, his unique experiences as a celebrity bodyguard, his decades-long friendship with President Trump, Trump's loyalty and resilience, and more.

# Trump's Momentous Girls' Sports Exec Order, and CBS Reveals Kamala Edits, w/ Klavan, Johnson & Zito
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 06, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=0.0s)]
*  Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. [[00:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1.44s)]
*  President Trump remains an offense and the results have been incredible. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3.3200000000000003s)]
*  I just, it's, I can't get over it. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=10.36s)]
*  Like I said, the days keep passing. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=13.6s)]
*  He keeps doing more incredible things. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=15.6s)]
*  Amazing things, gifts to us, just writing the deep immoral wrongs that [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=19.92s)]
*  were done to us during the Biden administration. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=27.44s)]
*  And we knew he was going to, he promised that he would, but aren't you so used [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=30.0s)]
*  to being disappointed by politicians? [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=35.2s)]
*  Everything's too hard. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=37.68s)]
*  It didn't work out. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=39.36s)]
*  The Democrats wouldn't cooperate. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=40.76s)]
*  We get used to like, well, I guess, you know, we tried and what's happening. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=43.04s)]
*  Yes, it's via executive order. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=48.72s)]
*  Yes, it can be undone by the next president, but it's something, it's progress. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=50.32s)]
*  He's doing what he said he would do. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=56.0s)]
*  He's fulfilling the promises he made to us. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=58.6s)]
*  And then he will also push, push for the legislation. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=61.440000000000005s)]
*  He is doing that too. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=64.2s)]
*  But at least we have a four year fix. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=66.28s)]
*  At least we have a four year restoration to sanity and morality in some [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=68.04s)]
*  departments, like the one I'm about to talk about, such that Americans can live [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=74.08s)]
*  again in a way that makes sense, in a way that is safe, in a way that is normal. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=79.4s)]
*  And if another president comes in after Trump and tries to undo it, they will feel [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=87.32s)]
*  the acute shift in a way that will be profound and will, I think, stop the [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=91.6s)]
*  next president from doing it. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  So there is real value in these executive orders. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=97.96s)]
*  Forget, you know, that, that's a valid point, the one I just made, but think of [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=101.55999999999999s)]
*  all, for example, with respect to the girls in sports issue, think of how many [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=105.35999999999999s)]
*  girls are going to be protected. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=110.08s)]
*  Think of how many girls are not going to have to undress in front of a boy [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=111.88s)]
*  pretending to be one of them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=114.56s)]
*  You are not going to have their teeth knocked out on the field hockey field [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=116.8s)]
*  because Trump used his pen to fulfill a campaign promise. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=121.08s)]
*  It was a thing of beauty yesterday. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=127.6s)]
*  He signed, it truly was beautiful. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=129.32s)]
*  He signed an executive order banning men and boys from women's and girls sports. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=131.76s)]
*  And the NCAA has already said it will comply. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=140.51999999999998s)]
*  It was a complete victory in the war to protect our girls. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=145.88s)]
*  Just unbelievable. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=152.88s)]
*  The video. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=154.95999999999998s)]
*  Let's watch it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=159.2s)]
*  Let's watch it because it was, it's actually kind of emotional. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=159.64s)]
*  Uh, and then I'm going to bring in our first guest. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=163.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, if you'd like to gather around me, I think I'm going to be okay. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=167.32s)]
*  Secret services worried about them. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=175.2s)]
*  Do we have to worry about them? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=184.0s)]
*  We have big problems. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=185.39999999999998s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=187.28s)]
*  Do you want to have it? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=187.6s)]
*  Do you want to do this? [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=188.72s)]
*  Watch, watch what I do. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=190.23999999999998s)]
*  And then I'm going to give you some pens. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=191.2s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=192.44s)]
*  You ready? [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=193.72s)]
*  What a nice picture this is, huh? [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=194.39999999999998s)]
*  Governor, you're ready. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=196.23999999999998s)]
*  We'll do a good job. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=198.48s)]
*  Wait, let me press that. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=199.32s)]
*  I want to make this a really good signature because this is, you know, this is a big one, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=200.44s)]
*  Oh, I think we have a 10. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=215.76s)]
*  We have a 10. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=218.0s)]
*  God bless you. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=219.44s)]
*  Surrounded by young, innocent, fresh faced girls who just want to play their [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=227.12s)]
*  sports against other girls. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=232.68s)]
*  That's all they're asking. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=234.6s)]
*  Just for fairness and safety in sport. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Something that for many decades has been a foregone conclusion in the wake of title [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=239.39999999999998s)]
*  nine, but wasn't recently. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=242.72s)]
*  Thanks to Joe Biden, that villain and his sidekick, Kamala Harris, who actually tried [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=244.56s)]
*  to convince us she could do this job. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=250.04s)]
*  You know, we've talked about this, but the night before the election, I went to [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=252.0s)]
*  Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and did something I've never done before in my life. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=255.6s)]
*  Certainly not as a journalist, but not even as a private citizen. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=259.15999999999997s)]
*  And that was, I endorsed a candidate and spoke on his behalf and urged [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=262.03999999999996s)]
*  other people to vote for him. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=266.08s)]
*  And I was there specifically. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=268.68s)]
*  This was my task. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=271.2s)]
*  I wasn't asked specifically to do this, but my choice to explain my vote was to [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=272.2s)]
*  tell people that those who are mocking president Trump's, president Trump's [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=277.0s)]
*  promise to protect women did not understand what he was actually going to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=282.28s)]
*  do when he took the office, that I was voting for him specifically because I [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=286.12s)]
*  believed that promise. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=290.0s)]
*  We spoke about that night, Lake and Riley. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=292.12s)]
*  I mentioned her by name. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=294.96s)]
*  What was his first order of business? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=296.36s)]
*  The very first piece of legislation he signed into law. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=298.96s)]
*  The Lake and Riley act to protect other young American women and men from the [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=302.0s)]
*  crimes committed by illegals who are here, who repeatedly offend. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=308.76s)]
*  And then in these sanctuary cities get turned right back out onto the street, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=313.48s)]
*  which is what happened in Lake and Riley's case. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=317.0s)]
*  And now what we've had three executive orders, one declaring that sex is binary. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=319.92s)]
*  There are no trans anythings. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=327.12s)]
*  You cannot transition from being male to female or female to male. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=330.16s)]
*  You can pretend you can call yourself that do your thing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=333.68s)]
*  The rest of us do not have to participate in your delusion. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=337.6s)]
*  And we will not be saying your pronouns or pretending that your delusion is [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=340.76s)]
*  anything other than unwellness. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=344.48s)]
*  Then one declaring that the federal government would not be participating in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=348.12s)]
*  any gender transitions because that's fake too. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=353.04s)]
*  You cannot use Medicare funds or Medicaid funds to chop off the healthy [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=356.76s)]
*  genitals of children in the name of this sick ideology, nor can any institution [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=360.44s)]
*  taking government funds in any way, perform these procedures and continue [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=366.12s)]
*  to accept those funds. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=370.52s)]
*  And now we get this one, this one that has 79% support of the American people. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=372.40000000000003s)]
*  67% of the democratic party is on the same page as Donald Trump on whether we [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=379.56s)]
*  should have boys who pretend to be girls playing in girls sports, men who pretend [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=388.96s)]
*  to be women playing in women's sports. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=393.48s)]
*  The answer is no. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=395.96s)]
*  This was immoral. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=398.88s)]
*  It was evil and it's coming to an end. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=400.12s)]
*  Joining me now to discuss this historic executive order and all today's news, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=403.52s)]
*  Andrew Claven. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=408.12s)]
*  He's the host of the Andrew Claven show at the daily wire and author of the [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=409.24s)]
*  forthcoming book, the kingdom of Kane, finding God in the literature of [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=412.52s)]
*  darkness, which will be released in May. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=417.52s)]
*  I cannot imagine life without them. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=433.59999999999997s)]
*  They've got a great life, but some dogs are not so lucky. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=435.35999999999996s)]
*  And that's why I'm so glad to tell you about Delta rescue, the largest, no kill [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=438.64s)]

*  I mean, this is the complete destruction of a way of thinking that has been [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=511.4s)]
*  imposed on us, not just through the Biden administration. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=515.88s)]

*  This is 30, 40 years of a way of thinking that is absolutely, it absolutely makes [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=521.1999999999999s)]
*  sense. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=526.4799999999999s)]
*  And what Trump is doing is he's doing exactly what the left has so expertly [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=526.9599999999999s)]
*  done to us. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=531.64s)]
*  The left knows how to basically, you know, what Scott Adams, the Dilbert guy [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=532.56s)]
*  calls talk past the sale, talk past the important point. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=537.68s)]
*  So they get us into an argument about whether a transgender person can use a [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=541.3599999999999s)]
*  girl's bathroom or play in a girl's sport. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=545.9200000000001s)]
*  And while we're fighting about that, we've already lost the argument because we've [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=548.48s)]
*  already accepted that there is such a thing as a person who can transition from [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=551.76s)]
*  one sex to another, which there's not. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=555.6s)]
*  And because Trump is such an expert at the culture, you know, he's not an expert [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=557.8000000000001s)]
*  in politics, he's an expert at the culture. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=561.6800000000001s)]
*  He understood that just by gathering those little girls and young ladies around [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=563.64s)]
*  him, he was showing us a picture of what we have been told to forget that these [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=569.64s)]
*  are our women, these are our future mothers of a generation that I won't even get to [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=574.16s)]
*  see be born. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=578.64s)]
*  These are wives of people who haven't even met them yet. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=579.84s)]
*  These are the people that we cherish as women. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=582.72s)]
*  And for years, we've been taught that we can only that women can only feel that [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=585.16s)]
*  they've accomplished something if they accomplish something as men. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=589.28s)]
*  And that means that somebody who is a man who dresses up like them is essentially [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=592.6s)]
*  can replace them. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=597.1999999999999s)]
*  They've taken away these children's identities. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=598.36s)]
*  They've taken away their achievements. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=600.88s)]
*  They've taken away their feminine modesty. [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=602.96s)]
*  They've taken away their spaces and their safety. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=604.9200000000001s)]
*  And it is when you see those girls gathered around him, you know, you really you [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=607.12s)]
*  tear up, as you say, that God is present in that moment because we remember what we [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=611.48s)]
*  always knew that these are people that we cherish and we cherish them in their [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=615.8000000000001s)]
*  girlhood, in their femininity, in their womanhood. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=619.6800000000001s)]
*  All this stuff that has grown up recently, they kind of that these Andrew Tate clowns [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=622.32s)]
*  and Pearl Davis who tell us we hate each other, these are all distortions forced on [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=627.4000000000001s)]
*  us by leftist feminism, by this idea that women are not valuable as women. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=632.16s)]
*  They're only valuable as make believe men. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=637.4399999999999s)]
*  And and so we've kind of been taught we've got this anger in us, especially younger [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=639.92s)]
*  men. I think they have this anger and this idea that we are at war with one another. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  That's never been true. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=649.4s)]
*  That has never been true in any human civilization, in any successful human [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=650.64s)]
*  civilization. Men and women cherish each other. [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=654.8399999999999s)]
*  They actually respect each other. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=657.12s)]
*  They understand that they're different and have different roles and different [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=658.6s)]
*  strengths, and they they understand that they're complementary. [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=661.44s)]
*  And all of that was wiped away until finally we found ourselves, you know, actually [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=664.5600000000001s)]
*  allowing people with penises to walk in to girls locker rooms and bathrooms. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=669.6s)]
*  I mean, it was a kind of insanity. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=674.84s)]
*  Fifteen percent of the so-called women in women's prisons are men. [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=676.8800000000001s)]
*  And I mean, this is this is the kind of madness that we've been talked into instead [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=681.6s)]
*  of basically living on our common sense, our ability to know what we know. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=686.0s)]
*  I mean, it's it's really interesting when my friend, you know, Matt Walsh at the [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=691.04s)]
*  Daily Wire made that film. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=695.32s)]
*  What is a woman? [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=696.76s)]
*  The answer was not as easy to come up with as you might think, because a woman is a [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=697.88s)]
*  whole thing. You know, a woman is not just a body. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=702.0s)]
*  It's not just a genetic code. [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=704.96s)]
*  It's not just a shape. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=706.64s)]
*  It is actually an entire thing that we all understand in our hearts, but can't [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=708.12s)]
*  always express. And the left has cleverly used its cultural expertise to talk us [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=712.08s)]
*  out of of that knowledge. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=718.12s)]
*  And Trump is using his equal cultural expertise backed up by a new media that [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=720.68s)]
*  supports him to to remind us who we are, to remind us that we're men and women. [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=725.68s)]
*  We're glad we're men and women. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=730.52s)]
*  We think it's a beautiful part of creation. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=731.72s)]
*  It's the source of all human life. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=733.76s)]
*  And when you see them gathered around him like that, you just think, what have we [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=735.88s)]
*  done? What were we even talking about? [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=739.72s)]
*  What kind of nightmare have we been in that we have to wake up from it like this [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=741.48s)]
*  and tell people pass orders saying you can't castrate little boys and cut off [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=745.56s)]
*  the breasts of little girls and you can't steal their spaces in their sports? [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=749.64s)]
*  It's an amazing moment and a genuine transition. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=753.0799999999999s)]
*  And I think it will last far longer than the usual executive orders. [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=755.8s)]
*  I I love everything you said. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=760.28s)]
*  I'm feeling like I I feel euphoric about it. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=762.4799999999999s)]
*  I feel emotional about it. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=765.76s)]
*  I feel a lot for the girls who have been hurt over the past four years, who, you [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=766.88s)]
*  know, all these trans lobbyists are like trans people exist, you know, don't erase [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=771.24s)]
*  our existence. They erase the pain of girls just like that. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=776.12s)]
*  They just pretend it didn't happen. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=780.24s)]
*  You know, I referenced that night in Pittsburgh and it was. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=781.72s)]
*  For me, it was a big deal to go and do that. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=785.96s)]
*  I've never done that before, and it was really important to me to do it. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=788.08s)]
*  If I could convince any of my fellow women, because I know that there are a lot of [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=792.76s)]
*  Democrat women who were kind of open minded to Trump because of issues like this, [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=797.32s)]
*  who were still being told he was Hitler, who were still being told he hated women. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=802.5200000000001s)]
*  And I felt in my heart that if I could speak to them, if I could reassure them [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=806.4000000000001s)]
*  that even that was standing my weird past with Trump, I was fully on board [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=810.5200000000001s)]
*  and supporting him and that they needed to see him through this different lens. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=815.1600000000001s)]
*  They needed to understand he really would protect us. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=818.12s)]
*  He really would. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=821.6400000000001s)]
*  And that absolute cretin Chris Cuomo then [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  mocked me for saying I needed to be protected by Donald Trump. [[00:13:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=825.64s)]
*  I do want Donald Trump to protect me with laws that enforce, for example, [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=829.76s)]
*  our immigration policies, and I do want him to protect my 13 year old daughter, [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=833.6s)]
*  Chris Cuomo, so go fuck yourself if you don't understand that. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=838.1999999999999s)]
*  But this is what I said that night, and it's why I'm so emotional today. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=841.84s)]
*  The boys should not be in the girls sports. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=846.6s)]

*  Peyton McNabb, North Carolina sophomore in high school, slammed so hard in the face [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=860.5600000000001s)]

*  He stepped in there. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=895.3199999999999s)]
*  He's been in office two weeks and two days and he signed this executive order. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=896.36s)]
*  Therefore, it is the policy of the United States to rescind all funds from educational [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=901.4s)]
*  programs that deprive women and girls of fair athletic opportunities. [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=907.12s)]
*  I'm feeling emotional about it, which results in the endangerment, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=911.24s)]
*  humiliation and silencing of women and girls and deprives them of privacy. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=915.08s)]
*  It shall also be the policy of the United States to oppose male competitive [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=919.12s)]
*  participation in women's sports more broadly as a matter of safety, fairness, [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=923.16s)]
*  dignity and truth, directing that the Secretary of Education take all [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=928.2s)]
*  appropriate action to affirmatively protect all female athletic opportunities [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=933.1999999999999s)]
*  and all female locker rooms and to prioritize Title IX enforcement actions [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=937.52s)]
*  against any educational institution that denies female students an equal [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=942.8399999999999s)]
*  opportunity to participate in sports or athletic events by requiring them to [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=948.28s)]
*  compete against or appear unclothed before males. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=952.88s)]
*  What a day, Andrew. [[00:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=958.1999999999999s)]
*  What a day. He did it. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=959.9599999999999s)]
*  It's an amazing thing. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=961.6s)]
*  You know, when you really think about it, [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=963.12s)]
*  especially after the advent of Christianity, every Western civilization has been built [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=964.84s)]
*  upon the protection of women, the idea that women don't need special [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=969.56s)]
*  protections is simply a nonsense. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=973.1999999999999s)]
*  It's not insulting to say when you have people who are stronger than you, [[00:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=975.36s)]
*  who want what you've got, when you have the fact that you can conceive and [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=979.0799999999999s)]
*  deliver children who need to be protected and make you more vulnerable because you're [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=983.76s)]
*  the one who has to protect them. [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=988.28s)]
*  Entire societies all throughout the West, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=990.04s)]
*  since Christianity, have been built upon protecting women and making sure they have [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=992.76s)]
*  lives. The marriage laws that feminists fall on the fainting couch over were [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=997.5600000000001s)]
*  invented by churchmen to basically say, no, you can't just kidnap a woman and carry [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1002.88s)]
*  her off and impregnate her. You have to actually commit. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1007.72s)]
*  If she's going to be faithful to you, you've got to be faithful to her. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1011.04s)]
*  Entire networks of philosophy and society are all based on that. [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1014.52s)]
*  And the left just thought, we'll turn that off now and it'll be fine. [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1019.52s)]
*  And what, of course, happens, you know, of course, women are victimized. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1022.52s)]
*  And it's kind of it's kind of bizarre that a guy like Trump, who has been a playboy [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1026.28s)]
*  and all that and has said, you know, insensitive things should be the guy to fix it. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1031.52s)]
*  But it's also kind of appropriate because one of the things that has happened is [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1035.16s)]
*  among the intelligentsia, the commentariat, is that they make fun of Trump for the way [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1039.56s)]
*  he talks, the kind of bluntness that he has. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1044.12s)]
*  He's not an intellectual. He has no philosophy. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1046.6799999999998s)]
*  And one friend of mine once called him the guy at the end of the bar. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1049.08s)]
*  And I said, you know, when you plunged into a time of madness, the guy at the end [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1052.28s)]
*  of the bar has a lot to say because all he's doing is talking common sense. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1056.7199999999998s)]
*  And when and when Trump promised during his inaugural speech and he promised we're [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1060.7199999999998s)]
*  going to have a golden age of common sense, that's what we're looking for. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1064.32s)]
*  Because again, Megan, we do know these things. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1067.9199999999998s)]
*  We do know what women are. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1070.36s)]
*  We do know basically what they need in order to live a full, healthy, normal life. [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1071.76s)]
*  We built our civilization around that protection. [[00:17:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1076.32s)]
*  It's been the wonder of the world. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1079.76s)]
*  I mean, it is the wonder of the world. [[00:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1081.52s)]
*  The way women have been treated in modern Western society. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1083.28s)]
*  When you compare society before that, of course, there were flaws and of course, [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1086.1200000000001s)]
*  there were things that had to be staggered forward toward and grasp. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1090.0s)]
*  But it is an amazing thing that has happened not just in America, but in Europe [[00:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1093.04s)]
*  in the 19th century, the rights that women have secured, the protection that they have [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1098.76s)]
*  and the entire civilizational network built to protect them. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1104.1200000000001s)]
*  And the left just wanted to sweep it away like it was nothing. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1108.2s)]
*  And when you see Trump with those girls around them and I have a daughter and you [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1111.1200000000001s)]
*  do and you understand that this is urgently important. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1116.32s)]
*  This is the whole all of us should be. [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1120.44s)]
*  This is not a male female idea. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1122.48s)]
*  This is something that all of us as [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1124.72s)]
*  civilized Western Christian based people should care about down to our toes. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1126.52s)]
*  And it is it was a tremendously moving moment and only part of this cultural [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1131.76s)]
*  revolution that Trump is overseeing. [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1137.24s)]
*  It's a it's a beautiful, beautiful thing [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1139.3600000000001s)]
*  that he's overseeing and that ushered him into office. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1141.6000000000001s)]
*  Here he is just a bit more from the man [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1144.68s)]
*  himself as he declared the EO, not one. [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1146.8400000000001s)]
*  This is one of the big reasons that we [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1152.3600000000001s)]
*  all want and one of the big reasons that we had a record, a landslide like they [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1154.3600000000001s)]
*  haven't seen before very often anyway. [[00:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1158.96s)]
*  And who could forget last year's Paris [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1162.88s)]
*  Olympics where a male boxer stole the woman's gold medal after brutalizing his [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1165.48s)]
*  female opponent so viciously that she had to forfeit just after 46 seconds. [[00:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1169.76s)]
*  And she was a championship fighter. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1175.28s)]
*  And actually, they had two women or two [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1177.24s)]
*  people that transitioned and both of them won gold medals and they won them very [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1179.36s)]
*  convincingly. But all of that ends today because with [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1185.4399999999998s)]
*  this executive order, the war on women's sports is over. [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1188.9199999999998s)]
*  It's amazing. It's huge progress. [[00:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1197.08s)]
*  It does not it's not going to apply to [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1199.6s)]
*  private schools that don't take federal money or to independent sports. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1202.04s)]
*  You know, it doesn't it doesn't govern the Olympics. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1206.8799999999999s)]
*  It doesn't govern, you know, whatever. [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1209.08s)]
*  Pick your sport that men are invading. [[00:20:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1211.8799999999999s)]
*  That's that's another battle. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1213.6799999999998s)]
*  And it's an executive order. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1215.1599999999999s)]
*  And we still need to sign the law, the law that we just had Senator [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1216.76s)]
*  Tuberville on the other day who introduced this legislation. [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1220.6399999999999s)]
*  And it keeps getting kicked out, keeps getting buried even by Republican [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1224.24s)]
*  leadership right now in the Senate, which we're trying to pressure them into having [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1228.6799999999998s)]
*  a vote on this thing to it's the call to protect women and girls in Sports Act. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1232.24s)]
*  So we need a law with the Republicans control the House, the Senate and the [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1236.12s)]
*  White House. There's no reason we can't have a law. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1238.84s)]
*  This this issue has 79 percent support of the American people, 67 percent of Democrats. [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1240.84s)]
*  Here's CNN's Harry Enton laying out the numbers yesterday. [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1248.76s)]
*  I think these numbers are really illuminating on this topic because I just [[00:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1253.0s)]
*  think there's such a clear trend among the American public. [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1256.6399999999999s)]
*  So transgender female athletes in women's sports, only 18 percent of the country [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1260.52s)]
*  says that they should be, in fact, allowed to participate in women's sports. [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1265.96s)]
*  Compare this to the opposition. [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1270.2s)]
*  I mean, my goodness gracious, 79 percent. [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1271.92s)]
*  You rarely get 79 percent of the country to agree on anything, but they do, in fact, [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1274.48s)]
*  agree on the idea of opposing transgender female athletes in women's sports. [[00:21:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1279.44s)]
*  And as he points out, what does this country agree on named name another issue [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1285.44s)]
*  that we're 79 percent in agreement on? [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1290.5600000000002s)]
*  I don't I don't think you can find one really. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1294.48s)]
*  Maybe like how we felt about Betty White, right? [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1296.72s)]
*  Like it has to be something that generic and non-controversial. [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1300.0800000000002s)]
*  This is extremely controversial. [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1304.76s)]
*  The other way to do this is extremely controversial. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1306.72s)]
*  And it's amazing to me we're actually going to be joined by Senator Ron Johnson [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1310.64s)]
*  in after you because he's on our side on this. [[00:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1314.68s)]
*  And I'm going to ask him what he thinks. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1318.0800000000002s)]
*  But this is the fact that Republican leadership won't let this come out for a [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1319.2s)]
*  vote in a Republican controlled Senate. Why not? [[00:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1323.0400000000002s)]
*  What Republican would ever vote against it? [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1326.68s)]
*  And why are we afraid of making the Democrats go on record with their no votes [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1328.52s)]
*  when almost 70 percent of their own caucus, their own voters agree with you [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1332.64s)]
*  and me and Ron Johnson on it? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1337.92s)]
*  Because the Republicans haven't caught on yet to the fact that the media is no [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1340.1200000000001s)]
*  longer controlling the narrative, the mainstream or legacy media is no longer [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1343.76s)]
*  controlling the narrative. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1347.92s)]
*  They're so used to being cowed and frightened and whipped by this circle of [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1349.12s)]
*  media that surrounds Washington, D.C., that they don't understand that nobody [[00:22:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1354.72s)]
*  cares what they think anymore. [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1357.76s)]
*  Nobody cares what the New York Times opinion is anymore. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1358.92s)]
*  It literally does not matter. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1361.36s)]
*  And when you say that 79 percent, that's changed like 15 or 16 percent just in the [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1363.16s)]
*  last few months. [[00:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1368.4s)]
*  And the reason it has changed is because Trump has given people permission to think [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1369.8s)]
*  what they already thought. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1374.2s)]
*  No one ever, ever has believed that people could change sex. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1375.4399999999998s)]
*  I don't believe even the people who think they believe it believed it. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1378.52s)]
*  But it took a guy, you know, the same guy who could take a bullet in the ear and [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1381.6399999999999s)]
*  spit the bullet back at the guy and say, fight, fight, fight. [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1385.3999999999999s)]
*  The same that that was the kind of attitude it took simply to say that the emperor [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1388.48s)]
*  wasn't wearing any clothes, simply to say that all these leftist propositions were [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1392.6799999999998s)]
*  not just wrong, they were immiserating, you know, they were immoral. [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1396.8s)]
*  And so when if the Republicans as a group do not wake up to the fact [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1400.08s)]
*  that they are no longer constrained by this empire of lies, that the empire of lies [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1405.3999999999999s)]
*  has fallen, it is gone, if they don't catch on to that, they're going to be replaced. [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1410.24s)]
*  You know, they're going to be pushed out in primaries. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1414.48s)]
*  They're going to absolutely disappear. [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1416.72s)]
*  This is a different party. [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1419.04s)]
*  It's a different Republican Party. [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1420.4399999999998s)]
*  There may be parts of that Republican Party I don't like as a kind of mainstream [[00:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1421.8799999999999s)]
*  conservative, but that's that's fine. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1425.4399999999998s)]
*  This is a picking up. [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1427.28s)]
*  It's a populist movement in the sense that it is following the will of the people. [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1428.84s)]
*  And in this case, the will of the people awakened by Donald Trump and other people [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1433.72s)]
*  who have had the courage to speak their minds like you, [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1438.5600000000002s)]
*  they're actually saying what simple, basic truth that's right in front of them. [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1442.1200000000001s)]
*  And I think if the Republicans cannot bring this into law, they're out of their [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1445.72s)]
*  minds, because I think if they actually bring it forward, even some of the [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1450.0800000000002s)]

*  I want to pick up on your comment about the assassination attempt in one second. [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1456.24s)]
*  But you're a screenwriter, a Hollywood screenwriter, in addition to being a very [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1459.2s)]
*  successful podcaster and book writer. [[00:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1462.88s)]
*  Your comment reminded me back when I was much younger, I loved this movie. [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1466.04s)]
*  I actually still love this movie. [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1470.1200000000001s)]
*  I've seen it so many times now. [[00:24:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1471.2s)]
*  I don't pull it up very often, but it's Far and Away by Ron Howard. [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1472.3600000000001s)]
*  It stars Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1475.52s)]
*  And they're Irish and she's sort of upper crust and he's more working class. [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1478.3200000000002s)]
*  And he shows up in her hometown to kill her father, who's the wealthy landowner [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1483.44s)]
*  who he who had his dad, well, not killed, but like was disrespectful to their family [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1488.3999999999999s)]
*  and burned their house after his father died. [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1494.1599999999999s)]
*  So he shows up there to try to kill her father and shoots but misses. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1496.04s)]
*  And it's a debacle. [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1500.12s)]
*  Well, so she shows up and rescues him from the makeshift prison her mother has made [[00:25:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1501.28s)]
*  for this Tom Cruise character and asks him to come with her as she goes to America. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1507.2s)]
*  She's fleeing to America to live a more independent life. [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1511.9199999999998s)]
*  And but he's just tried to kill her father. [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1514.32s)]
*  So why would she do this? [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1515.96s)]
*  And there's a great line where she's up [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1517.3200000000002s)]
*  on this ladder trying to rescue him from this second floor bedroom saying, boy, [[00:25:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1518.76s)]
*  come with me. And he's looking like you're out of your mind. [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1523.2s)]
*  And she says, what I saw you do out there. [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1526.24s)]
*  You spat on that guy's face. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1529.6000000000001s)]
*  You stepped on his neck. [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1531.5600000000002s)]
*  That could be very useful to me. [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1532.8000000000002s)]
*  Boy, you said you wanted land. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1535.0s)]
*  If that's what you want, then come with me. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1537.96s)]
*  Great ship sail out of Dublin and Liverpool. [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1542.72s)]
*  But a woman dare not travel alone. [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1545.8400000000001s)]
*  No, you're brave. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1547.44s)]
*  You shoot men. You step on their necks. [[00:25:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1549.4s)]
*  When I saw that, I realized you could be very useful to me. [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1551.96s)]
*  And that's how you have to look at Trump, even if you hate him, which I don't. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1556.6000000000001s)]

*  He is the guy who spat out the bullet all [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1565.4s)]
*  but and said, fight, fight, fight. He's the guy who was who was told by everybody [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1568.24s)]
*  that Brett Kavanaugh was a gang rapist. [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1572.84s)]
*  And he said, no, he's going on the US Supreme Court. [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1576.16s)]
*  He's the one who after January 6, when the whole nation was like, you're gross [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1579.52s)]
*  and we never want to see or hear from you or your entire family again, was like, [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1584.32s)]
*  no, you will. And actually, I will be your next president. [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1587.8s)]
*  And I will never concede anything about January 6. [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1590.72s)]
*  I did win. Never, never budge. [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1593.8799999999999s)]
*  That could be very useful to us in fighting the vicious, [[00:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1597.72s)]
*  deranged far left that wants to erase what it means to be human. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1602.4s)]
*  They want to erase, like, truly humanity. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1608.8000000000002s)]
*  The difference between [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1612.0400000000002s)]

*  not particularly well group of people who happens to be extremely vocal and [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1624.24s)]
*  politically active. [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1629.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, this is the exact reason I voted for Trump the first time, [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1630.96s)]
*  the first time he ran, even though when I first saw him, I was shocked. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1634.56s)]
*  I made an extremely viral video attacking Trump the first time he ran because of his [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1638.4s)]
*  attitude and his his ill manners and the cruelty of calling people names and all [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1644.0s)]
*  this stuff. But as I watched him, I began to realize that we were wrapped so thick [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1648.12s)]
*  in a network of lies that it actually was going to take a man like that to speak the [[00:27:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1652.96s)]
*  simple truth. You know, I believe in being polite. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1658.24s)]
*  I love being polite. [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1661.56s)]
*  I think it is a wonderful way to to treat other people. [[00:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1662.68s)]
*  But in being polite, I've always said exactly what I thought. [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1665.28s)]
*  And I've always talked told the truth. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1668.0800000000002s)]
*  I think for most people, it takes a certain amount of just [[00:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1670.04s)]
*  belligerence before you can break through this network. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1673.28s)]

*  And you'll say, you know, they're cutting up the bodies of young people. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1683.52s)]
*  That's something out of Nazi Nazi Germany. [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1687.6000000000001s)]
*  They always talk about Nazi Germany. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1689.88s)]
*  That's actually something they did in Nazi Germany. [[00:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1691.44s)]
*  That is Joseph Mengele level evil. [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1694.24s)]

*  bowl them over and knock them down. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1709.68s)]
*  And it has been, you know, they threatened to put him in jail. [[00:28:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1711.2s)]
*  They convicted him of a felony. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1714.0800000000002s)]
*  I was watching him during that bogus trial in New York, perhaps one of the worst [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1715.76s)]
*  miscarriages of justice I've ever seen in an American courtroom where they were [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1721.24s)]
*  accusing of something nobody knew what it was. [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1725.0s)]
*  I was watching him and thinking, you know, I consider myself a fairly hard character, [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1726.84s)]
*  but I do not know if I could just spit in their eyes like this day after day. [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1731.04s)]
*  Well, they're threatening to put me in jail for a crime they can't even name. [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1734.76s)]
*  And it didn't even stop him when he saw his mug shot. [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1739.16s)]
*  He looked at him and said, that would look good on a T-shirt. [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1741.96s)]
*  Yes. And then his presidential portrait is almost the identical image of it. [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1744.8s)]
*  He totally leaned in. [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1749.96s)]
*  Somebody probably said, you know, it looks a little like the mug shot. [[00:29:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1752.0800000000002s)]
*  And he was like, great. [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1754.04s)]
*  Then that's the one. [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1755.24s)]

*  And, you know, there's just strength of this man. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1781.64s)]
*  He was at the National Prayer Breakfast this morning and said the following. [[00:29:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1783.8000000000002s)]
*  Listen, a study. It didn't affect my hair. [[00:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1788.5600000000002s)]
*  Can you believe it? [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1791.16s)]
*  Might have touched it, but not where it counts. [[00:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1795.72s)]
*  Not not the skin part. [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1798.3200000000002s)]
*  But it's no, honestly, it's a very changed. [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1799.92s)]
*  It changed something in me. [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1802.6s)]
*  I feel I feel even stronger. [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1803.84s)]
*  I believed in God, but I feel I feel much more strongly about it. [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1806.28s)]
*  Something happened. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1811.0s)]
*  So thank you. [[00:30:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1811.84s)]
*  So first of all, just love his sense of humor. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1815.56s)]
*  And when it's at his own expense, so much the better. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1818.08s)]
*  But second of all, Andrew, I think you appreciate the second sound, because he went on. [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1821.36s)]
*  And I think, you know, it doesn't seem to me that Trump is a particularly religious [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1824.72s)]
*  man, but I know he did grow up going to church on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1827.72s)]
*  We know the church that he used to go to. [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1833.84s)]
*  And he mentioned God and the role of God in our nation this morning, appropriate place to do it. [[00:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1836.1200000000001s)]
*  But take a listen to the messaging on it. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1844.3600000000001s)]
*  America is and will always be one nation under God. [[00:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1846.56s)]
*  At every stage of the American story, our country has drawn hope and courage and inspiration [[00:30:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1850.68s)]
*  from our trust in the Almighty. [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1856.96s)]
*  Deep in the soul of every patriot is the knowledge that God has a special plan and a glorious mission for America. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1861.28s)]
*  And that plan is going to happen. [[00:31:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1870.3600000000001s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1872.88s)]
*  I hope it happens sooner rather than later. [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1873.88s)]
*  It's going to happen. [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1876.24s)]
*  And it's his hand that guides us every single step of the way. [[00:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1877.28s)]
*  How about that? [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1885.04s)]
*  I mean, of course, we've heard that many times in church and so on. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1886.04s)]
*  But he it's his hand that guides us every step of the way. [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1889.1200000000001s)]
*  I feel like Trump is the one being guided. [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1892.92s)]
*  You know, Trump is the one being guided by that hand on a daily basis, setting an example [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1894.88s)]
*  for us all and improving lives for us all. [[00:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1899.84s)]
*  It was just to me, it was like very medical. [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1902.76s)]
*  It was just to me, it was like very meta, you know, that he was saying those things, [[00:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1905.48s)]
*  given all that he's doing. [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1908.72s)]
*  You know, I was at the first two Trump prayer breakfasts and on the first one, he really [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1910.76s)]
*  didn't know what he was doing. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1916.8s)]
*  It was kind of embarrassing. [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1918.08s)]
*  He was talking more about himself and his success. [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1919.3999999999999s)]
*  I once called him back in those days and I think I was right. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1922.6s)]
*  I once called him the first post-Christian president in the sense that he wasn't even [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1925.36s)]
*  pretending to believe in the Christian verities. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1929.04s)]
*  He would make fun of people for being poor, which is the opposite of Christ. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1933.0s)]
*  When he was asked if he needed God's forgiveness, he said, no, I just try to live so I don't [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1936.3600000000001s)]
*  need to be forgiven. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1940.2s)]
*  He really didn't know what he was doing. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1941.8s)]
*  And when he would start to pick up the evangelical language of some of his supporters, I didn't [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1944.0s)]
*  believe him. [[00:32:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1949.96s)]
*  Since that assassination attempt, his tone has changed. [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1950.96s)]
*  I can tell that he's, you know, as you say, I don't think he's a tremendously religious [[00:32:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1954.72s)]
*  person. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1958.6000000000001s)]
*  I don't think he's studying theology or reading the Bible every night. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1959.6000000000001s)]
*  But I think he suddenly does get the fact that these people who talk about God, like [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1962.84s)]
*  me, you know, are not talking about empty space. [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1966.72s)]
*  They're talking about something that is really there. [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1969.3999999999999s)]
*  And his tone has definitely changed. [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1971.12s)]
*  And the things he's saying are things that he has learned from hard-won experience. [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1973.6s)]
*  And I think it really is different and it doesn't make a difference because that too, [[00:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1978.8799999999999s)]
*  as I know I've said to you too many times, that too is something that we have to learn [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1983.52s)]
*  to talk about with courage and boldness and not be talked out of the things that we know [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1987.56s)]
*  are there. [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1991.84s)]
*  It's great to see him think about it and lean into it. [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1993.2s)]
*  I agree with you. [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1996.84s)]
*  There's a difference. [[00:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1997.84s)]
*  Trump hasn't changed his basic nature, which is good because that could be very useful [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=1998.84s)]
*  to us. [[00:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2002.1200000000001s)]
*  But there's definitely been a softening, I think, of him as a human in that he seems [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2003.1200000000001s)]
*  a bit more loving. [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2008.96s)]
*  He seems a bit more serene. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2010.32s)]
*  He's still a fighter, all the things, but he has this other side now that we never saw [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2012.48s)]
*  much of publicly, even if we were trying to cover him fairly and not as part of that [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2017.2s)]
*  fake news hating media. [[00:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2021.8400000000001s)]
*  He's more generous with showing that side of himself at a minimum. [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2023.8400000000001s)]
*  I agree. [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2026.8s)]
*  I want to shift gears because it was just a wonderful 24 hours and worth the first half [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2027.8s)]
*  hour of our show. [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2033.32s)]
*  Okay, but something else significant happened yesterday with respect to CBS News. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2034.32s)]
*  So the audience may remember that CBS interviewed Kamala Harris right before 60 minutes. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2038.88s)]
*  Right before the election. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2047.68s)]
*  And they put out this interview, which they sliced and diced. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2049.72s)]
*  And you weren't quite sure what was, you know, was this the natural, like, was this a full [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2055.16s)]
*  interview or wasn't it? [[00:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2060.46s)]
*  And then somebody online on Twitter was smart and pointed out that the tease that they had [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2061.82s)]
*  aired the day before on Face the Nation showed the interviewer's question, something like [[00:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2067.0s)]
*  Netanyahu doesn't appear to be listening and Kamala's answer. [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2072.48s)]
*  And then the next night when they aired the full thing or that, whatever, the Monday night, [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2076.6s)]
*  it was the same question with a different answer. [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2081.7999999999997s)]
*  And that led to this whole thing where Trump wound up suing CBS News for $10 billion for [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2083.64s)]
*  fraud, consumer fraud, defrauding consumers to win an election. [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2091.48s)]
*  And the FCC demanded a transcript of the interview, which for some reason, CBS would just would [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2096.44s)]
*  not release. [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2102.54s)]
*  It became a big public firestorm. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2103.54s)]
*  People said, just release the transcript. [[00:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2104.72s)]
*  They said no. [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2106.2s)]
*  Well, now they've had to. [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2107.2s)]
*  They were forced to hand over the full raw video and transcript to the FCC this week. [[00:35:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2109.68s)]
*  So it turns out now we know the full sit down with Trump, with Kamala was just over 50 minutes. [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2116.6s)]
*  And what they ultimately aired was a cut down version that was about 20 minutes in length. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2122.12s)]
*  Now that is typical for 60 minutes. [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2126.04s)]
*  They don't normally air their full interviews and they don't typically release the raw videos [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2128.9199999999996s)]
*  anywhere. [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2134.2799999999997s)]
*  But having said that, they've done it before. [[00:35:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2135.36s)]
*  They released the full transcript, I think, or video of JD Vance. [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2137.96s)]
*  Catherine Harridge was pointing that out. [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2141.8s)]
*  They've done it before. [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2143.52s)]
*  So once it became a controversy, why wouldn't they have done it? [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2144.8s)]
*  Right. [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2148.36s)]
*  The preview clip hit Face the Nation. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2149.36s)]
*  It didn't match the version we saw the next night on 60. [[00:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2150.7200000000003s)]
*  And watch, you can see that discrepancy in this clip here. [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2154.0s)]
*  But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2157.0800000000004s)]
*  Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2161.8s)]
*  region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2171.4s)]
*  advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2180.76s)]
*  But it seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. [[00:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2183.0800000000004s)]
*  We're not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2187.56s)]
*  about where we stand on the need for this war to end. [[00:36:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2192.2799999999997s)]
*  Not much better, but slightly more clear. [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2197.4s)]
*  With the release of the full video, now we know how that whole thing actually took place. [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2200.12s)]
*  First, the question from Bill Whitaker was actually edited down and the part taken out [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2204.12s)]
*  was more pointed than the way it aired in either version. [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2210.96s)]
*  And you can see the full Kamala answer too. [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2215.32s)]
*  It seems that Prime Minister Netanyahu is not listening. [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2217.48s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal said that he that your administration has repeatedly been blindsided [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2223.0s)]
*  by Netanyahu. [[00:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2230.2400000000002s)]
*  And, in fact, he has rebuffed just about all of your administrations and treaties. [[00:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2231.2400000000002s)]
*  Well, Bill, the work that we have done has resulted in a number of movements in that [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2239.68s)]
*  region by Israel that were very much prompted by or a result of many things, including our [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2248.2799999999997s)]
*  advocacy for what needs to happen in the region. [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2257.6s)]
*  And we're not going to stop doing that. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2260.44s)]
*  We're not going to stop pursuing what is necessary for the United States to be clear about where [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2262.44s)]
*  we stand on the need for this war to end. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2267.64s)]
*  OK, so what we learned is that the first half of that inane answer was aired on Face the [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2271.88s)]
*  Nation as a Tease and on actual 60 Minutes, which aired the next night. [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2277.16s)]
*  They used the second half of the answer, which was more succinct, though I don't know that [[00:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2282.36s)]
*  it was more clear. [[00:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2289.08s)]
*  I'm going to have to say 60 might have just been shooting for something that was a little closer [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2290.6s)]
*  to comprehensible. [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2297.24s)]
*  If you want to give them the benefit of the doubt, neither answer was good. [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2298.9199999999996s)]
*  They both sucked. [[00:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2301.72s)]
*  But now we do know that there wasn't more inanity stuck inside the answer. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2302.8399999999997s)]
*  There were just those two bits of inanity, and they chose one for Face the Nation and [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2307.72s)]
*  one for 60. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2312.2799999999997s)]
*  OK, but there's more because now we've seen the raw footage of the interview and we learned [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2313.64s)]
*  that the next 10 minutes of Q&A was edited out entirely. [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2317.8799999999997s)]
*  Again, this is always going to happen. [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2321.56s)]
*  It's not inappropriate to edit an interview with a presidential candidate. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2323.8s)]
*  That is the format of 60. [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2327.48s)]
*  And most of us have limited time and limited airspace to put our interviews up in this [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2329.1600000000003s)]
*  kind of thing, like a pre-taped setting with somebody who's important. [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2334.76s)]
*  Not now because I'm on podcast, but back when I was on the cable news or the broadcast news. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2337.96s)]
*  But look here at what we never got to see. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2343.7200000000003s)]
*  We are people who have ambition and aspiration. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2347.0800000000004s)]
*  Oh, God. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2353.0s)]
*  And dreams and optimism and hope. [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2353.64s)]
*  If you look at the character of who we are and how we have achieved the strength that [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2360.12s)]
*  we have achieved, I believe in large part it is because of our character and our belief [[00:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2364.84s)]
*  in the promise of America. [[00:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2371.0s)]
*  And I'm running for president because I want to do everything that is possible to create [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2373.0s)]
*  an opportunity for people to achieve those goals, those ambitions and those dreams. [[00:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2379.72s)]
*  Okay. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2386.3599999999997s)]
*  So she said absolutely nothing. [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2386.68s)]
*  You guys all know how many times we heard those stupid phrases, meaningless out of her mouth. [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2388.4399999999996s)]
*  You can make the argument that, okay, they didn't need to include it because everybody's [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2393.7999999999997s)]
*  heard her say it. [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2398.2799999999997s)]
*  But you tell me whether it's putting the thumb on the scale editorially to take that out. [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2399.48s)]
*  In essence, you could make the case that you're running cover for her because she is showing [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2405.0s)]
*  what an empty vessel she is, that this is all she's got. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2410.12s)]
*  This is a major supposed to be substantive sit down. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2413.48s)]
*  And that's what she fills it with. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2416.7599999999998s)]
*  This completely empty calorie-less filler that she says everywhere. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2418.9199999999996s)]
*  Like you'd have to have the debate internally about whether you're running cover for her [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2426.04s)]
*  and taking that out. [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2429.48s)]
*  Later in the interview, Kamala went on a bizarre aside about picture day in school in Ohio [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2432.04s)]
*  on the subject of the eating of the dogs and the cats in Springfield, Ohio, which they [[00:40:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2439.08s)]
*  also saved her from. [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2443.2400000000002s)]
*  When I was attorney general, the words I spoke could move markets. [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2445.16s)]
*  So the idea that the former president who again is running to be president would use [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2449.88s)]
*  that microphone in a way that is about vilifying and demeaning a whole population of people. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2456.2000000000003s)]
*  You know what has happened because of that? [[00:41:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2463.08s)]
*  One day when this happened was a school day, picture day for an elementary school. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2464.9199999999996s)]
*  Picture day. [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2472.6s)]
*  You know what picture day is for our children? [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2473.3999999999996s)]
*  They get excited the night before we put out the clothes they're going to wear. [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2475.8799999999997s)]
*  They go to school making sure their faces are clean and their hair is done. [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2479.56s)]
*  And they go to school for picture day. [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2484.8399999999997s)]
*  And you know what happened to these children? [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2486.3599999999997s)]
*  They had to evacuate that day because they were so scared. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2488.68s)]
*  Because of the fear of the threats that were being issued in Springfield because of the [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2494.28s)]
*  words of Donald Trump. [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2500.84s)]
*  So I say that I'm glad you are pointing these comments out that he has made that have [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2503.1600000000003s)]
*  resulted in a response by most reasonable people to say it's just wrong. [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2511.7200000000003s)]
*  It's just wrong. [[00:41:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2516.6800000000003s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2520.28s)]
*  That's where she went. [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2520.92s)]
*  Words have such power. [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2523.56s)]
*  What could happen to the children? [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2526.2000000000003s)]
*  Well, let's look at what did happen. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2527.64s)]
*  Picture day got spoiled. [[00:42:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2528.92s)]
*  It got spoiled. [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2530.44s)]
*  I'm telling you, Bill. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2531.32s)]
*  And by the way, then she references the bomb threats, which we know and knew were international. [[00:42:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2533.56s)]
*  Some came from Russia. [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2539.2400000000002s)]
*  It had nothing to do with America. [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2540.36s)]
*  It was just shit stirring from out of the country. [[00:42:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2541.7200000000003s)]
*  But somehow that's Trump's fault. [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2543.48s)]
*  All of which would have led to criticism of Kamala Harris. [[00:42:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2545.48s)]
*  And it got omitted from the interview. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2547.64s)]
*  All they included was that last sentence. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2550.44s)]
*  I'm glad you're pointing these comments out that he's made. [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2551.96s)]
*  They've led to a response from people saying it's wrong. [[00:42:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2555.2400000000002s)]
*  It's just wrong. [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2559.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2560.44s)]
*  Another one. [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2561.0s)]
*  I'm going to get Andrew to comment on all this, but we had to get this to you. [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2562.28s)]
*  In another section, a substantive discussion on the border. [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2564.92s)]
*  And this part was edited out. [[00:42:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2568.84s)]
*  There are a variety of factors that relate to what we have seen globally. [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2570.52s)]
*  And what we are not immune from at our own border in terms of what we have seen in terms [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2577.4s)]
*  of surge of immigration and irregular migration. [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2583.08s)]
*  And there are solutions at hand. [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2586.44s)]
*  But we've got to have leaders who are solution oriented, which we've been and are. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2589.48s)]
*  And I am going forward. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2598.76s)]
*  Instead of leaders who want to make it a problem they can run on. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2601.32s)]
*  She's a no nothing. [[00:43:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2609.88s)]
*  So Andrew Clavin, was it election interference as someone the right claim, including president [[00:43:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2612.12s)]
*  Trump this morning, just your typical 60 minutes cut down or them? [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2617.08s)]
*  I mean, my own vote is like, it's not, I'm not surprised that all the edits they made [[00:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2623.4s)]
*  were to her benefit. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2630.2s)]
*  Well, I dozed off during those last two clips, so I can't really say too much about them. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2632.44s)]
*  But I think, look, you're right. [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2636.52s)]
*  It's subtle. [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2638.2s)]
*  What they did is they turned her from the babbling idiot we know she is into a faintly [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2638.8399999999997s)]
*  coherent presence on the screen. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2643.56s)]
*  And they did that because they all vote for Democrats and they want to support the Democrats [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2645.72s)]
*  and they hate Donald Trump. [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2649.56s)]
*  That's why they did it. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2650.3599999999997s)]
*  But it's so subtle. [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2651.24s)]
*  Can Trump win a lawsuit? [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2652.2s)]
*  Probably not. [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2654.44s)]
*  Maybe they'll settle, but probably not. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2655.24s)]
*  But that doesn't matter. [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2656.92s)]
*  These people need to be shamed. [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2658.12s)]
*  There is no bigger criminal element in our country than the American legacy news media. [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2659.64s)]
*  They have really done us dirt. [[00:44:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2667.56s)]
*  And as far as I'm concerned, each and every one of them should be paraded naked through [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2670.12s)]
*  the streets like in Game of Thrones while we throw rotten vegetables at them and cry, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2674.04s)]
*  shame, shame, shame. [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2678.68s)]
*  Because what they have done is they've made it almost impossible to hold anybody to account. [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2679.72s)]
*  They have basically cut off the flow of a politician does something wrong. [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2684.7599999999998s)]
*  The reporter exposes the fact that he's wrong. [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2690.8399999999997s)]
*  He has to pay price for it either legally or at the at the voting booth. [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2692.8399999999997s)]
*  That's the way a democracy is supposed to work. [[00:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2698.44s)]
*  And it can't work without a free press. [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2700.3599999999997s)]
*  And we simply have not had a free press. [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2701.8799999999997s)]
*  If you look at this country since Obama was president, there's just been no penalty for [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2704.52s)]
*  bad actions. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2709.3199999999997s)]
*  I mean, the IRS takes after Republicans, conservatives. [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2709.96s)]
*  Nobody gets fired. [[00:45:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2713.96s)]
*  Oh, there was not a scintilla of corruption there. [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2714.84s)]
*  Forget about it, because the press isn't looking into it. [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2717.4s)]
*  The press isn't exploring anything except how bad Donald Trump is. [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2719.32s)]
*  Most of and most of those stories were lies. [[00:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2723.08s)]
*  So now you have the press that isn't even held to account. [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2725.96s)]
*  They tell us that Biden is sharp as a tack. [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2729.48s)]
*  Nothing. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2732.52s)]
*  Nobody quits. [[00:45:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2732.92s)]
*  They tell us that there was Russian collusion. [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2733.64s)]
*  And then they give themselves Pulitzer Prizes for essentially elevating a Hillary Clinton [[00:45:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2738.2s)]
*  dirty trick. [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2742.6s)]
*  They tell us that the Hunter Biden laptop isn't real and we have to therefore censor [[00:45:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2743.16s)]
*  any reporter who explores the fact that it is real. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2748.52s)]
*  All of this stuff has been going on to cut off the people from any sense of reality. [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2751.3199999999997s)]
*  And I think it has played into the left's ability to tell us that boys can be girls. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2757.08s)]
*  It's played into the left's ability to basically do terrible, the kind of terrible things that [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2762.44s)]
*  Elon Musk is exploring in our US foreign aid. [[00:46:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2767.3999999999996s)]
*  All of those things they've been allowed to do because the press just will not do its [[00:46:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2772.76s)]
*  job. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2777.4s)]
*  You actually have young reporters saying, we don't need to tell the facts. [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2777.7200000000003s)]
*  We need to tell the truth. [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2781.8s)]
*  And you say, honey, if you don't know the facts, you can't get it the truth. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2782.92s)]
*  You don't know what the truth is until you get the facts and until you report the facts [[00:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2787.0s)]
*  and let the people figure out what the truth is. [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2791.1600000000003s)]

*  week. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2805.7200000000003s)]
*  And the fact that they have been able to do these things without ever being held to account, [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2806.28s)]
*  it is to me glorious to see people being fired now, reporters being fired and replaced, [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2811.8s)]
*  because they truly deserve it. [[00:46:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2817.7200000000003s)]

*  I kind of doubt it, but it doesn't matter. [[00:47:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2824.76s)]
*  Expose what they're going to do. [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2826.68s)]
*  They're going to settle it. [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2827.7200000000003s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2828.6s)]
*  They may well settle it. [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2829.16s)]
*  They're going to settle it because CBS News Paramount is trying to merge with this other [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2829.72s)]
*  group and they need government approval. [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2833.64s)]

*  I'm sure. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2838.6s)]
*  Listen, I've got to get to this before you go. [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2839.7999999999997s)]
*  You predicted the Beyonce, Bianca, sensory nudity at the Grammys. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2843.48s)]
*  I mean, almost exactly. [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2851.3999999999996s)]
*  Here you were January 3rd, long before the Grammys aired on your show, The Andrew Clavin [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2853.8799999999997s)]
*  Show. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2859.0s)]
*  Watch. [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2859.16s)]
*  I predict that a starlet will show up at a French film festival wearing a completely [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2859.72s)]
*  transparent dress and a news site will describe the outfit as shocking, even though no one [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2863.56s)]
*  is shocked or even particularly interested. [[00:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2868.68s)]
*  How did I mean you said exactly what she did, a completely transparent dress. [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2874.2s)]
*  Yeah, I apologize to France for thinking it would be them instead of us. [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2878.9199999999996s)]
*  But I think the thing is, you know, listen, this is my thing. [[00:48:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2882.68s)]
*  If I have any superpower at all is that I follow the culture really closely. [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2887.16s)]
*  And because I am an artist and because I create things, I can actually tell where things are [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2890.8399999999997s)]
*  going simply by watching movies and watching TV shows like this. [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2894.92s)]
*  And it actually it's actually not that hard. [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2898.52s)]
*  Once you're paying attention to that, instead of who's winning a congressional race in Ohio, [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2901.56s)]
*  you can actually see where things are going. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2905.72s)]
*  And this idea that, you know, it's kind of it's kind of a symbiotic relationship. [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2907.64s)]
*  These women dress in less and less and the media can basically get clicks by showing [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2912.52s)]
*  these half naked women so they have to be shocked by it. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2918.84s)]
*  But at some point, you know, we've seen what there is to see. [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2921.96s)]
*  We're not that shocked. [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2925.48s)]
*  And so it was kind of a natural conclusion that this was this was the way it was going to go. [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2927.0s)]
*  And I have to say, if at some at some point, I just feel pity for these girls. [[00:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2932.04s)]
*  You know, I mean, I just feel like this is what they've got. [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2936.6800000000003s)]
*  You know, I mean, instead of showing up beautifully dressed and, you know, [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2939.16s)]
*  elegant and elevated so that we actually admire them, they just have this kind of thing we [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2943.24s)]
*  stare at, which is nakedness. [[00:49:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2947.96s)]
*  And it's really kind of sad, actually. [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2949.64s)]
*  I know I'm I'm waiting for somebody to show up dressed like a normal person [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2951.96s)]
*  and just holding up their SAT score. [[00:49:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2957.64s)]
*  Would that be great? [[00:49:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2959.7999999999997s)]
*  That's it. [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2961.16s)]
*  That would be shocking. [[00:49:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2962.92s)]
*  Then even though I would be shocked. [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2963.96s)]
*  But who has the confidence to do that? [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2965.64s)]
*  It really like it doesn't take a lot to get attention, [[00:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2970.4399999999996s)]
*  especially as a woman who happens to in her case be beautiful. [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2972.8399999999997s)]
*  But my husband, Doug, was like, I'm like, she looks just a beautiful body. [[00:49:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2975.64s)]
*  He's like, she does not. [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2978.4399999999996s)]
*  She looks totally manufactured like a Mr. [[00:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2979.64s)]
*  Potato Head with all these huge parts added on to her. [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2982.3599999999997s)]
*  I'm just saying it's not hard, not hard to get attention as a nude woman at a public event. [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2986.7599999999998s)]
*  If you want it, it's sad that these two felt it was their only way. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2991.56s)]
*  Of getting their name in the news. [[00:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=2995.16s)]

*  because they care about chronic disease in this country, an issue I know is near and dear to you. [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3152.36s)]
*  So your prediction on whether he makes it? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3156.76s)]
*  Well, Megyn, first of all, thanks for having me on. [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3159.96s)]
*  I'm optimistic now. [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3162.68s)]
*  I know that Dr. Cassidy, Senator Cassidy had some concerns. [[00:52:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3164.12s)]
*  Those concerns were alleviated, so he voted for Bobby in committee, [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3168.2s)]
*  and I think that'll probably be the last hurdle. [[00:52:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3172.68s)]
*  So I'm quite optimistic. [[00:52:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3174.44s)]
*  Because you mentioned that panel, I thought that the most important [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3176.92s)]
*  snippet of testimony came from Dr. Chris Palmer. [[00:53:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3180.44s)]
*  He was a psychiatrist, does a lot of work with nutrition and mental health, [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3183.4s)]
*  and he made the point that they, whoever they are, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3188.12s)]
*  they don't want to know the root cause of chronic illness because they are corporate interests. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3190.92s)]
*  And if one of their ingredients, a herbicide, a pesticide, a pharmaceutical, a drug, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3198.92s)]
*  if it's a contributing factor or a cause of chronic illness or autism, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3205.2400000000002s)]
*  that will disrupt their multi-billion dollar business model. [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3209.96s)]
*  And of Bobby's testimony, I thought the fact that he said he spent the last few decades [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3212.52s)]
*  suing these agencies. [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3219.96s)]
*  He has a PhD in corporate capture, which is why he is exactly the right person [[00:53:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3222.8399999999997s)]
*  at the right moment in time here, because the American public, [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3227.64s)]
*  in a completely nonpartisan fashion, they want to know what is causing chronic illness. [[00:53:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3229.8799999999997s)]
*  They want to know what is causing the devastation of autism. [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3235.3199999999997s)]
*  I was thrilled to see Cassidy vote yes. [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3240.52s)]
*  I want to say, again, thank you to the audience of this show, [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3242.3599999999997s)]
*  because we gave out his contact information. [[00:54:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3245.72s)]
*  I'm sure his phones were ringing a lot, but I think they made the difference because [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3249.0s)]
*  it's not that often that a barrage of people start calling a US senator's office or emailing [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3253.7200000000003s)]
*  the office. [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3258.36s)]
*  And indeed, Politico has a report out this week saying, [[00:54:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3259.0800000000004s)]
*  Cassidy acknowledged that his phone was ringing off the hook [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3262.1200000000003s)]
*  with calls from supporters of Kennedy and his Maha movement. [[00:54:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3265.1600000000003s)]
*  So right on, our listeners and viewers, you made a difference. [[00:54:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3269.0800000000004s)]
*  And America and your kids hopefully will be healthier as a result of it. [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3274.36s)]
*  I want to ask you about Cassidy, though. [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3279.4s)]
*  He sure did say that he extracted a lot of promises from Bobby in order to get the yes vote. [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3281.88s)]
*  We have some of this on camera. [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3288.36s)]
*  Let's watch. [[00:54:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3289.88s)]
*  Committee on Immunization Practices recommendations without changes. [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3303.8s)]
*  CDC will not remove statements on their website pointing out that vaccines do not cause autism. [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3308.44s)]
*  But my support is built on insurances that this will not have to be a concern [[00:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3315.1600000000003s)]
*  and that he and I can work together to build an agenda to make America healthy again. [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3319.0s)]
*  So he seems to be saying there that they're going to be super close or they're going to talk [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3326.92s)]
*  several times a month that he promised that the immunization schedule recommended by the CDC will [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3330.2s)]
*  not change. That is controversial. [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3335.96s)]
*  Just the schedule, not pulling vaccines, but the schedule. [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3338.2799999999997s)]
*  And lastly, that he will not pull down the statement that the vaccines don't cause autism. [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3340.9199999999996s)]
*  So what do you make of that? [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3347.3199999999997s)]
*  Well, first of all, Senator Cassidy is chairman of the Health, Education, Labor, and Pension Committee. [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3349.72s)]
*  So I would expect that chairman of the committee would be in touch with the secretary of HHS [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3354.8399999999997s)]
*  frequently. [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3360.04s)]
*  So as I listen to what supposedly concessions, I don't really view them as many concessions [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3360.92s)]
*  whatsoever. I know Bobby quite well. I've gotten to know him. We fought the same [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3366.04s)]
*  battle in terms of bringing truth to the American public during COVID. [[00:56:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3371.72s)]
*  And he's very science-based. So I think his first task is to restore integrity to science. [[00:56:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3374.92s)]
*  We heard President Eisenhower and his farewell address. [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3382.68s)]
*  The second warning after the military industrial complex was public funding of science. [[00:56:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3385.16s)]
*  It was going to create a scientific and technological elite that would drive public policy. [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3389.8799999999997s)]
*  I would view that as corrupting science. Science has been corrupted. [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3394.04s)]
*  We have all kinds of evidence of that. So Bobby's first task is to restore integrity to science. [[00:56:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3398.2s)]
*  Make sure that the data is transparent, that you have everybody at the table. [[00:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3404.92s)]
*  Science sometimes is black and white, but often it is not, particularly when you're looking at [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3410.2799999999997s)]
*  cause and effect in the complexity of a human body. So again, my guess is Dr. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3414.36s)]
*  Cassidy is a doctor. He can look at evidence. Bobby Kennedy looks at evidence. He knows how [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3421.32s)]
*  to read science. So our policies will follow where the science leads us, where the truth leads us. [[00:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3425.56s)]
*  And I think both the men, Dr. Cassidy and Bobby Kennedy, are going to come together on those [[00:57:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3433.08s)]
*  points. So it shouldn't be controversial. I think what Bobby's saying is not completely [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3439.48s)]
*  rid of the MMR vaccine. Sorry, go ahead, Senator. Again, he's not going to do anything [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3445.16s)]
*  precipitously. He's going to become secretary and then he's going to restore integrity to [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3450.2s)]
*  science and let science guide his actions. And my guess is Senator Cassidy will also allow [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3455.08s)]
*  science to guide his action. And the fact of the matter is we have not ever tested any of these [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3461.08s)]
*  childhood vaccines against true placebos. The ingredients, for example, the aluminum adjuvant, [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3465.48s)]
*  I've learned was based on a study with four rabbits. One of the rabbits, so they lost the [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3473.3199999999997s)]
*  data on, the other ones were killed after 28 days, autopsies performed and the aluminum was [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3478.84s)]
*  still in their systems, in their organs. So again, that needs to be looked at. These are [[00:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3484.2799999999997s)]
*  legitimate questions that we haven't even been allowed to ask. So Bobby Kennedy is still going [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3488.44s)]
*  to be able to ask these questions. He'll still be able to drive the science and then restore [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3494.12s)]
*  integrity to it. So again, I just don't view these as serious concessions he's making. He's [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3499.56s)]
*  going to be very open. He's going to be transparent, which these agencies have not been because they [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3504.92s)]
*  have been captured. They have been corrupted. And I don't think Senator Cassidy is going to [[00:58:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3509.32s)]
*  have a problem with the transparency within these agencies. Good. Well, good on him for coming to [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3513.32s)]
*  the right decision. And sorry for all the phone calls, Senators, but you did the right thing. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3518.36s)]
*  Not really, sorry, but I'm sure it was kind of annoying. Okay, a couple of things to get to here. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3523.4s)]
*  When I sat in that hearing, as when I sat in the Pete Hegseth hearing, I could not believe [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3528.6s)]
*  the performance by some of these Democrats, Senator. And as a member of the committee that [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3533.4s)]
*  was listening to the first day of RFKJ, I wonder what your reaction was when it spiraled down into [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3537.72s)]
*  moments like this one with Bernie Sanders. Are you supportive of this? I've had nothing to do [[00:59:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3544.8399999999997s)]
*  with leadership. Are you supportive of these onesies? I'm supportive of vaccines. Are you [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3551.4s)]
*  supportive of these, this clothing, which is militantly anti-vaccine? [[00:59:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3555.4s)]
*  What did you make of that? Well, you heard my reaction during my time to comment and question. [[00:59:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3563.7200000000003s)]
*  First of all, it didn't surprise me, but it really disappointed me that the severe extreme hostility [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3571.64s)]
*  of Democrats, again, particularly knowing, you know, with the events I did on COVID and on, [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3578.2000000000003s)]
*  you know, nutrition and health, how completely non-partisan it is. You know, most of the doctors [[00:59:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3582.68s)]
*  in my panels were Democrats. They voted for Obama. They voted for Biden, but none of that [[00:59:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3588.52s)]
*  mattered to any of us. I mean, we were focusing on an area of agreement. That's what Bobby Kennedy [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3593.08s)]
*  wants to do. So it was very disappointing from the standpoint that Democrats couldn't recognize [[00:59:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3597.4s)]
*  the moment that the American people are hungering for the information. They don't want to be ill. [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3601.88s)]
*  They don't want autism rates to continue to skyrocket. They want the truth. They want solutions. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3608.28s)]
*  And there's nothing partisan about it. And let's face it, as Bobby Kennedy said, these people used [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3614.92s)]
*  to be my friends. You know, I mean, his name is synonymous with the Democrat Party, but they have [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3620.0400000000004s)]
*  just turned on him viciously. And that's just disappointing, particularly in light of the fact [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3624.76s)]
*  that President Trump, Bobby Kennedy set aside their differences, focused on an area of agreement, [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3629.4s)]
*  chronic illnesses, and in so doing, demonstrate not only how you solve a problem, but how you [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3634.6s)]
*  heal and unify a horribly divided nation. There are reports out this morning that the [[01:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3640.92s)]
*  Democrats are now getting ready to vote no uniformly, all of them, on all of Trump's [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3646.68s)]
*  nominees, because this is their new hashtag resistance effort, because they're angry about [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3651.7999999999997s)]
*  what he's doing with executive orders, with USAID and Elon. And so now there's a movement by Chuck [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3657.64s)]
*  Schumer to have them say no to everyone from this point forward. If so, it would mean the Republicans [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3663.8s)]
*  really can't lose more than three. So to get RFKJ or anybody else through, you'd have to make sure [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3669.5600000000004s)]
*  that Cassidy stays steady and that there's not another Cassidy lurking. We all know that [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3675.5600000000004s)]
*  possibly Murkowski, possibly Collins, possibly McConnell could be noes. So first, let me ask you, [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3680.52s)]
*  what do you think of that plan? And secondly, do you think that there is a different Cassidy who [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3685.8s)]
*  might surprise us and vote no against Kennedy? Because we are going to need all the Republicans, [[01:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3689.96s)]
*  I think. No, I don't think so. And I've had conversations with others. And again, I'm pretty [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3694.52s)]
*  confident that Bobby will be confirmed, because most Republican senators have the same attitude [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3701.08s)]
*  as I have. We respect the convincing victory of President Trump. He's the one that decides who he [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3705.96s)]
*  wants serving his administration. Our job is to investigate, make sure there's nothing disqualifying [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3714.28s)]
*  in the background. But if not, vote to confirm. And I think that's what will end up happening in [[01:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3718.92s)]
*  these cases. Plus, with Bobby, and I did the initial whip count on him. And it's really [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3723.7200000000003s)]
*  interesting how the conversation went with Republicans and Democrats. They would always [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3728.28s)]
*  start out saying, we know there's a lot that Bobby's doing that I really agree with, that I really [[01:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3731.64s)]
*  love. But, and he's alleviated those concerns, those buts. He's answered those questions. [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3735.7200000000003s)]
*  And people do realize, I think even Democrats in their hearts realize that what Bobby Kennedy wants [[01:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3742.04s)]
*  to do is unbelievably popular with the American public. But you don't think he's going to get any [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3747.96s)]
*  Democrat votes? What's that? Will he get any Democrat votes? At this point, probably not, [[01:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3753.48s)]
*  which is disappointing. You know, maybe John Fetterman. John is, you know, comes from a purple [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3760.76s)]
*  state. He's understanding the moment. He has voted through Republicans when no other Democrat has, [[01:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3765.4s)]
*  so possibly that. But it'd be nice, I think, earlier on, I was a little more hopeful. But [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3771.64s)]
*  again, based on the hearing, the hostility shown from even members that are generally [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3776.3599999999997s)]
*  more moderate in their, you know, at least presentation, came out pretty hostile. [[01:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3780.7599999999998s)]
*  Well, I really hope that these Democrats, whether they vote for him or not, [[01:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3786.9199999999996s)]
*  can get behind the MAHA movement, which is not political at all. They're Democrat moms [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3790.04s)]
*  and Republican moms and dads, for that matter, who want their kids to be safer and who want [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3796.9199999999996s)]
*  themselves to be safer. It's silly for people to prioritize this piece of our national conversation. [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3801.0s)]
*  It doesn't need to be politicized. Okay, you talked about these elites in the scientific field [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3807.16s)]
*  and how they've had a, we know better than you, approach and how this has been a longstanding [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3814.76s)]
*  fear in the United States. I've been watching, as you have been over the past many months, [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3821.48s)]
*  trying to get documentation from the CDC and the FDA and the National Institutes of Health [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3828.2s)]
*  on what was said internally when Fauci and the others were there about myocarditis and pericarditis [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3836.12s)]
*  and other side effects and serious risks or adverse consequences of the COVID vaccine. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3844.6s)]
*  And I have been watching as you've been getting stonewalled and stonewalled and [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3851.0s)]
*  documents that are supposed to look like this, but instead look like this because they've been [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3855.0s)]
*  so redacted, totally whited out as an effort to comply with your request. [[01:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3858.36s)]
*  So what happens now, Senator, because now we have President Trump's team going into those [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3864.36s)]
*  organizations. Of course, our FKJ ideally at HHS and then we're hoping J. Bhattacharya at NIH and [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3870.2799999999997s)]
*  we're hoping Martin McCary at FDA. So are we about to get the full disclosure on what they knew [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3876.52s)]
*  and when they knew it? You're aware of the fact that I have now issued what I'd consider as [[01:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3885.16s)]
*  friendly subpoena for documents that, again, I've written over 70 oversight letters during [[01:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3890.12s)]
*  the Biden administration and been basically given the middle finger. So top of the list was [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3895.56s)]
*  the last 50 pages of Anthony Fauci's emails unredacted. He released 4,000 through FOIA. [[01:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3901.72s)]
*  They're heavily redacted, but even those are quite incriminating. We narrowed our search down to, [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3908.7599999999998s)]
*  or request down to 400. We've been allowed to go into reading room, take notes, but make no copies. [[01:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3913.24s)]
*  And we got down the last 50 pages. They have not shown those to us. We've been looking for those [[01:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3918.3599999999997s)]
*  for years. So those should be produced unredacted. That'll be interesting. Plus the 17 pages of [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3922.12s)]
*  talking points, instead of issuing a warning on the health alert network on the myocarditis that [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3928.2s)]
*  they were getting reports on from Israel, for example, in the early months of 2021, right after [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3933.96s)]
*  the rollout, they were going to issue an alert on that health alert network. Instead, they came up [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3938.8399999999997s)]
*  with a 17 page talking point memo. It'll be really interesting to put together all the timelines of [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3943.96s)]
*  what these federal officials were telling the public, what lies they were telling the American [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3949.8799999999997s)]
*  public versus what they actually knew behind the scenes. But we should get those 17 page talking [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3955.0s)]
*  points. That should be pretty interesting as well. But also, their proportional reporting ratios, [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3959.48s)]
*  their empirical Bayesian analysis, which should be public information, but they've kept hidden, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3965.08s)]
*  should also be pretty revealing. So again, we already know people like Fauci, Francis Collins, [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3971.72s)]
*  these federal health officials lied to the American public repeatedly about their injections, [[01:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3978.68s)]
*  about COVID. They didn't base things on science. They just pulled it out of the air. [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3983.88s)]
*  I think there's going to be a reckoning. I think there's going to be a lot of truth being exposed [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3988.92s)]
*  here in the next couple of months. I'll be very interested to see what you guys find. Please keep [[01:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3992.04s)]
*  us in the loop and we'll have you back on once you get your information back. All right, last [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=3997.32s)]
*  but certainly not least, this historic executive order by President Trump today on women's girls, [[01:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4001.32s)]
*  women's and girls sports, keeping men and boys out of them. And we spoke with coach [[01:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4006.6s)]
*  Tuberville, Senator Tuberville last week about why he can't get a vote on the Senate floor on his [[01:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4014.7599999999998s)]
*  bill that would turn this exact executive order into law. We all love the four year reprieve from [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4022.36s)]
*  this madness, but we'd much rather have it written into a law where the next president, [[01:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4028.6s)]
*  if it were a Democrat, could not just revoke it with a different executive order. So [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4031.96s)]
*  what is your take, Senator, on why John Thune will not schedule a vote on the Protect Women and Girls [[01:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4036.76s)]
*  in Sports Act? Oh, my guess is merely a timing issue. And again, President Trump has acted boldly, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4042.2s)]
*  swiftly, decisively to make sure that girls aren't going to be harmed by male athletes now. They're [[01:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4048.92s)]
*  not going to be in their locker room, their bathroom, or they're going to risk those [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4055.32s)]
*  organizations going to risk loss of federal funding. So I think we have time to actually [[01:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4058.44s)]
*  put this for a vote. Now, it'll be interesting to see what Democrats will join us. Of all the crazy, [[01:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4063.64s)]
*  I mean, just gobsmackingly crazy agenda items of the Democrat Party, the fact that they promoted [[01:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4068.84s)]
*  this transgenderism agenda and allowed male athletes to compete against our girls is the most, [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4076.84s)]
*  like I say, just jaw-dropping of all of them. So let's hope Democrats have seen the light and [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4084.12s)]
*  we can codify this so that the next crazy Democrat president doesn't go back to this [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4088.6s)]
*  transgenderism and put our girls and women at risk. All right. When you say you think it's just a [[01:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4093.72s)]
*  matter of timing, what does that mean? Because we don't want to wait until after the midterms [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4099.48s)]
*  when we might not control both houses of Congress with sane people who will vote for this. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4103.5599999999995s)]
*  So what does that mean? I mean, are you confident that Thune will bring it to the floor for a vote [[01:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4109.0s)]
*  in the Senate? Yeah, I'd be shocked if he didn't. Again, Democrats are not cooperating on nominations, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4112.2s)]
*  so we're having to run the clock. And we have limited time for legislation right now. It's [[01:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4117.48s)]
*  all about confirming President Trump's nominees so they can start getting in there, cleaning out the [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4121.96s)]
*  deep state. Again, I think the confirmation process is completely out of control. I have [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4127.0s)]
*  dramatically reduced the number of confirmed positions for both Democrat and Republican [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4131.72s)]
*  presidents, but that's not the state. And so right now, top priorities, get these people in place [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4135.8s)]
*  and we'll turn our attention to this. Again, this would be a pretty, I think, a high priority [[01:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4140.76s)]
*  bill to get on the Senate floor to at least put Democrats on notice, put them on record that they [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4146.280000000001s)]
*  really want biological males to harm our girls. I don't think that's a good vote for them. 67% [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4151.64s)]
*  of Democrats are in favor of Trump's policy. 67% of Democrats, 79% of the electorate as a whole. So [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4158.04s)]
*  you should bring it to a floor. Make them say no. Make them say no before the midterms. That would [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4165.16s)]
*  be really fun to watch. A couple of things. You mentioned you're in a big push to get Trump's [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4169.0s)]
*  nominees through. Well, in the wake of the funding freezes that Trump issued early last week, both [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4175.24s)]
*  with respect to some foreign aid, now we've got the USAID controversy and other issues, [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4183.48s)]
*  the Democrats have decided to make Russ vote the nominee for OMB, Office of Management and Budget. [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4190.2s)]
*  They're a new fall guy. They don't want him to get through, but they can't stop him because he [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4196.280000000001s)]
*  does have the votes. So they're doing like a sleep in. I guess they can delay the vote by 30 hours. [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4200.4400000000005s)]
*  Here is Chris Murphy, Democrat Senator from Connecticut, on the sacrifice he and his staffers [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4209.240000000001s)]
*  have made. I took the 2 a.m. Actually, I was on the floor about 1 a.m., so about 1 a.m. to 5 a.m. [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4216.04s)]
*  shift. I slept on my couch for about 2 hours of fitful sleep. I'm back up and headed off campus [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4222.6s)]
*  right now to talk about the danger of Trump's foreign policy. We don't rest. We don't rest. [[01:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4229.56s)]
*  This is an urgent moment. We have days or weeks to be able to mount an effective opposition to [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4236.360000000001s)]
*  stop this slide away from democracy. And so I thank all my colleagues who have been part of [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4243.56s)]
*  this important night, and we're going right back at it today. [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4248.6s)]
*  They don't rest. Senator, your response? Big whoop, huh? What a charade. Again, [[01:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4253.96s)]
*  they're not cooperating. They're dragging their feet. They're making us around the clock. But [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4259.8s)]
*  Russ vote, by the way, one of the better, if not best, nominees for President Trump, because Russ [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4263.56s)]
*  is head of OMB. He writes the rules and regulations to implement a lot of what President Trump is [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4269.88s)]
*  trying to do. And so he's just a key figure, highly experienced, very conservative. So I'm [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4276.84s)]
*  a big Russ votes supporter. Are you resting on the GOP? Did you sleep on a cot? [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4282.12s)]
*  We've done some of that stuff, too. But again, really, I'm not into feudal in general. Every [[01:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4290.76s)]
*  now and then you just got to show your supporters you're willing to fight. That's what Democrats [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4295.24s)]
*  are doing. Like I say, big whoop. It's no big deal. Right. They're yelling into the wind, [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4297.96s)]
*  which is a cleaned up version of the way that saying normally goes. Senator, it's a pleasure. [[01:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4303.32s)]
*  Thanks so much for being here. Thanks for having me on. Have a great day. You too. Ron Johnson, [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4308.28s)]

*  spotted at Trump's business records trial in New York. He was part of the Trump entourage. The media [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4464.6s)]

*  They were focusing on Trump's entourage. It's hard to tell. I will say just as an observer in the [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4482.6s)]
*  courtroom, the entourage today is colorful. You know, if you look at the entourage today, you see [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4487.4800000000005s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz, you see Chuck Zito, the former president of the Hell's Angels. This is a show of [[01:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4491.96s)]
*  force. This is deliberate and quite frankly, this is genius. The Hell's Angels leader is a very large [[01:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4497.320000000001s)]
*  man wearing a very flamboyant suit. Donald Trump had a new entourage supporting him in court today. [[01:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4504.04s)]
*  One of the people who showed up actor Chuck Zito used to lead the New York chapter of the Hell's [[01:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4509.32s)]
*  Angels. That is amazing. A large man in a flamboyant suit. That clip is from a forthcoming [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4513.96s)]
*  documentary called Chuck Zito, an American story. Chuck, welcome back. Great. Welcome. Great to have [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4521.719999999999s)]
*  you. Thank you for having me. How can people watch the documentary? First of all, it was not finished [[01:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4528.84s)]
*  yet. We just had the premiere at Mar-a-Lago last week. We're going back to the [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4533.4s)]
*  change a few pieces in it. Okay. Because so many people are interested in it, like, you know, [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4542.04s)]
*  Netflix and Amazon Prime, so many people. So I was told by one of the networks to just, there was a [[01:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4549.16s)]
*  couple of repeats in it. So we're going back to the drawing board and tighten it up. And we're going [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4558.2s)]
*  to have a premiere in April in New York. Okay. So it'll be perfect then. I love it. I, what do you [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4563.08s)]
*  make of that description of yourself? Flamboyant man in a suit. Former Hell's Angel. I mean, yes, [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4569.4s)]
*  somewhat. Yeah. Well, you look good. Thank you. Thank you. All right. So I learned something in [[01:16:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4575.72s)]
*  preparing for this interview that I did not know before. I didn't know that, I mean, I knew Hell's [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4581.48s)]
*  Angels. I always knew that they were kind of like bad boys, kind of cool, badass. But I didn't know [[01:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4585.88s)]
*  that there's some rumors that you like might have to kill somebody to become a part of the Hell's [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4591.48s)]
*  Angels. That's a myth that goes along with everybody. Of course not. So what's like, [[01:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4595.24s)]
*  what are, what are the Hell's Angels? It's a motorcycle club. As we get together, [[01:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4601.0s)]
*  ride motorcycles. You have to be admitted. Well, you have to, there's a hanging around process [[01:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4605.32s)]
*  that a prospecting process before you become a member. So you have to know someone to [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4612.599999999999s)]
*  hang out first and then prospect and goes down the line. Is it all Harleys? [[01:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4616.84s)]
*  Well, in the United States it is, but overseas, a lot of guys couldn't get Harleys. And then now [[01:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4625.16s)]
*  a lot of guys I've heard are using, some guys are using Indians and some guys BMWs. But back [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4630.84s)]
*  in the day when I was there, it was all Harleys. So you grew up where? In the Bronx. I was born in [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4638.6s)]
*  the Bronx, then moved to Brooklyn. Yep. My dad grew up in Brooklyn too. And so, [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4644.04s)]
*  but we both lost our dads at young ages. You were only 12. Well, no, no, I was actually, [[01:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4649.56s)]
*  when I say I lost my dad, it was when they got divorced. Okay. So I was, then my dad lived to 78 [[01:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4656.92s)]
*  and he died in 1998. But when I say I lost my dad is means that when they got divorced, I was always [[01:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4665.56s)]
*  looking up to my dad and I followed, tried to follow in his footsteps, being a boxer and everything. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4671.4s)]
*  And that's when I say I should have made a little clearer on the thing because I'm 12 years old and [[01:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4675.24s)]
*  I lost my dad. Even my sister says, what do you mean? It sounds like you really looked up to him [[01:18:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4681.4s)]
*  and he was, he followed his footsteps into the boxing world. My father was a great fighter back [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4686.839999999999s)]
*  in the day in the thirties and the forties. You know, years ago, guys had, you know, hundreds of [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4691.5599999999995s)]
*  fights. My father had 228 fights back in a day and a 12 year career. And won most of them. He [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4699.48s)]
*  won a lot of them. Absolutely. He lost 20, but he used to get paid $10 a fight. Not today to make a [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4706.44s)]
*  400 million one fight. That's like Jimmy Braddock. Yeah. James Braddock. Yeah. It's like, like, like, [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4711.959999999999s)]
*  you know, there's great fighters like, you know, Floyd Mayweather, he's 15, but he's fighting like [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4718.36s)]
*  28 years. Right. There's a guy named Harry Greb back in a day. He Floyd went 50 and oh, in 28 [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4724.2s)]
*  years. Harry Greb went 52 and oh, in one year. Oh my gosh. So it's a big difference. So you [[01:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4731.639999999999s)]
*  decided to follow the old man's footsteps and get into fighting? Yes, of course. Growing up with, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4738.599999999999s)]
*  with my dad and his, you know, I had, I was living in the Bronx on Barretto street and hunch point [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4743.88s)]
*  at the time. And Stephen in my documentary, I was five years old and this guy butch like from [[01:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4750.44s)]
*  a little rascals used to beat me up every day. So I want to cry and home to my dad. And one time he [[01:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4756.2s)]
*  said, don't ever come crying home to me. He's on a teacher how to defend yourself. So he pulled out [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4760.679999999999s)]
*  his trunk and he had all this, you know, his gloves and his robe and his head gear and everything in [[01:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4765.16s)]
*  there. And he put the gloves on me. You know, my, the gloves went up to my elbows and he got on his [[01:19:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4769.639999999999s)]
*  knees and started teaching me how to box. You learn from the best. Yeah. So, so I noticed too, [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4775.48s)]
*  because there's a lot, there's a big group today that's very into mixed martial arts and Jiu Jitsu [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4780.839999999999s)]
*  in particular. Yes. People are loving. I know Joe Rogan loves it. I know, um, Jocko Willink, he came [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4787.32s)]
*  on the show and said he believes we should all have our kids learning Jiu Jitsu, not just for [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4793.4s)]
*  the physical, you know, nature of it and it's self defense, but the discipline, the mental discipline [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4798.12s)]
*  that comes with it and the respect. And you, how many black belts do you have? I've, I've trained [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4803.4s)]
*  in eight different styles of martial arts. My first, after seeing Bruce Lee in the green hornet, [[01:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4807.639999999999s)]
*  I said, I want to be like Bruce. So I went down to Aaron Brank's karate studio in New York city [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4813.96s)]
*  and started taking a white crane and tiger claw kung fu with Mr. Chin. From there, you're very [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4819.48s)]
*  impressionable. You saw the dad did the boxing, you did the boxing and you saw the Bruce Lee. I'm [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4825.08s)]
*  glad you didn't watch Tootsie too many times. Every time I saw someone like, you know, Steve Reeves, [[01:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4828.84s)]
*  he had, he always, I think the greatest body he, I saw him in Hercules, Hercules, Unchained. I said, [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4835.64s)]
*  I want to be look like Steve and you love Superman too, right? Superman, Mighty Mouse. I used to, [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4842.360000000001s)]
*  I watched that Superman show every day after school. It was in black and white. They'd run [[01:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4847.96s)]
*  the reruns. Yes. And, uh, with the original, you know, now it would look so dated to us, right? But [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4851.24s)]
*  it was great at the time. All right. So you start doing the jujitsu or you start taking martial arts? [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4856.84s)]
*  I was boxing for a long time. Uh, after seeing Bruce Lee, of course, like I said, I started [[01:21:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4861.16s)]
*  taking martial arts and I've trained eight different styles of martial arts. I went from, uh, [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4866.84s)]
*  uh, white crane and tiger claw kung fu to, uh, Chikita jujitsu, committee root jujitsu, [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4870.92s)]
*  BMS jujitsu. Oh wow. I never heard of that. I trained with, uh, uh, Hanzo Gracie and Brazilian [[01:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4876.360000000001s)]
*  jujitsu. So do you have a favorite of those? Like if I'm going to have my kids take jujitsu, [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4881.16s)]
*  which one, what? Well, you know, I also did a Japanese jujitsu, which is a form of everything, [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4886.84s)]
*  you know, ground grappling, boxing, everything. But, uh, Brazilian jujitsu, let's face it, they, [[01:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4892.6s)]
*  the ones who brought it to the octagon, you know, the Gracie's, you know, they first brought it here [[01:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4897.64s)]
*  before, you know, Fetidus bought the, uh, UFC and, uh, Dan White became president. So, uh, it was, [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4903.72s)]
*  uh, guys like John Milius, the director, he designed the octagon and a guy named Mark Davey, [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4909.88s)]
*  who had the tough band contest back in the day. So it was those three, the Gracie's and Art Davey [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4915.88s)]
*  and John Milius started the, uh, UFC. So if you've got all these black bolts and all this [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4920.6s)]
*  discipline in the martial arts, how long would it take you to knock me out? If you wanted to, [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4926.52s)]
*  you, I've never had a girl in my life. If you had to 30 seconds, 60 seconds, boom, [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4932.12s)]
*  he's flicking his fingers. So actually that's what, uh, um, uh, [[01:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4939.32s)]
*  well, his show I did. So he asked me how long would it take you to knock me out? I said, [[01:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4948.28s)]
*  it'd be over by now. So it already would have happened. Yeah. Well, you're not afraid of, [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4952.28s)]
*  not a girl, but you're not afraid of punching a celebrity because I've heard there was an incident [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4957.639999999999s)]
*  with John Claude Van Damme. I've had a few. What happened with him? That's why I don't work that [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4962.2s)]
*  much. What happened? I was just, uh, you know, it was, we, we got along real well. We were, uh, [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4966.52s)]
*  I was his bodyguard in 1992 and, uh, we went our separate ways and I didn't see him until six [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4973.72s)]
*  years later and he came in with Mickey rock and like five guys and in scores. I was having dinner. [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4980.6s)]
*  I'm familiar with scores. That's where all the beautiful women went to, that was back in the day. [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4984.92s)]
*  So we had a little argument and, uh, [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4989.96s)]
*  you know, I felt bad because I, I got so much, uh, publicity from somebody else's misfortune. So [[01:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=4995.08s)]
*  how did he upset you? Uh, you just, uh, uh, said something to, uh, money, one of your tenants in [[01:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5001.72s)]
*  the, uh, manager when he was in there, said disrespectful. So I went up to him and [[01:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5007.56s)]
*  about, you know what it happened? Yeah. Yeah. It's a long time ago. 29 years ago, almost 30 years ago, [[01:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5013.56s)]
*  but you don't like to talk about it. An Italian thing. Like you got offended. He offended you. [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5019.0s)]
*  Oh, of course. Of course. I mean, you know, you got to, uh, you know, back up your words. So, [[01:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5023.32s)]
*  and that's what happened. So you went over and gave it to him. Uh, yeah. And he did not, but it [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5029.88s)]
*  took 17 years for us to talk again. So we're friends now. And, uh, so you go over and you [[01:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5034.6s)]

*  understand. Sweet. Yeah. But most of us, the thought of punching John Claude Van Dam is [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5045.88s)]
*  horrifying. Um, we'd get punched back and it would not go well for us. You have a lot of experience. [[01:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5049.8s)]

*  because it was so long ago. No, you didn't. I brought it up. It's not your fault. So you, [[01:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5107.08s)]
*  but the reason he knew you prior to that whole incident, you pointed out was you were his body [[01:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5111.24s)]
*  guard. So you took your background and learning self-defense and so on and parlayed that into [[01:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5115.0s)]
*  like being a celebrity bodyguard. You body guarded some of the best everybody could think of back in [[01:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5121.08s)]

*  bodyguarded, must feel like a very big responsibility. I mean, if he can't take care of it himself, [[01:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5278.599999999999s)]
*  it's a serious threat. So it's got to be, I bodyguard for Muhammad Ali, Joe Frazier, Mike Tyson. [[01:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5283.639999999999s)]

*  with somebody. Of course. Yeah. Look what happened to Mike on the plane and everybody else. Well, [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5293.719999999999s)]

*  reason. Like it's not that they, they can't protect themselves. Look at Floyd. He walks around with [[01:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5303.4s)]
*  10 guys. I mean, yeah, you don't want to get sued. Uh, here's a bit from Sly, uh, and brother Frank [[01:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5307.0s)]
*  in your documentary, South 44. I guess it was at pretty much the height of my popularity. So they [[01:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5313.8s)]
*  overdid it, you know, security thing at the time, whoever was in charge of security said, oh, well, [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5320.92s)]
*  we need more people. And then Chuck and a few of his friends volunteered and being a very outgoing [[01:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5326.2s)]
*  guy, he struck up a conversation. I noticed, you know, we kind of looked like very similar, [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5332.84s)]
*  like brothers in a sense. Of course he looked just like, we looked more like them than I did. [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5337.48s)]
*  I was being hunted and since he looked alike, I was hoping they'd shoot Chuck. That was actually [[01:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5342.36s)]
*  the motivation. I gave him a T-shirt with a bullet. Don't play bulls eye. Nice. He's a great guy. [[01:29:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5347.0s)]
*  Now I know why he hired me. Is he not a great guy? Yes. Yes. He's a true gentleman. Look, [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5354.36s)]

*  Expendables. He's just a great guy and a very talented and a great writer. Absolutely. He's, [[01:29:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5373.799999999999s)]
*  as he was speaking there, we heard a soundtrack pop in from Joan Jett. Joan Jett. And there's a [[01:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5381.08s)]
*  reason we have Joan Jett. She's also in the documentary talking about her relationship with [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5385.24s)]
*  you. Here's a bit from Joan. This is great. And the next time we saw him was, was in, in Japan. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5389.639999999999s)]
*  That whole tour that we did, we went to tour in Japan in 1985. We had them in our crew. And [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5399.16s)]
*  the way I looked at it is they were doing security and had to do it for us at some points. [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5409.72s)]
*  Okay. So I'm just the fact that, you know, Joan Jett is so cool. She's just cool. She's, she's, [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5416.92s)]

*  off and did a Joan Jett and the Black Hearts and, uh, all of her music is still turn up the dial. [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5427.88s)]
*  Absolutely. Absolutely. And she does all the music for my, my documentary. These people must [[01:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5433.5599999999995s)]
*  really like you to have appeared in the film, you know, because it's one thing like I've had lots of [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5438.68s)]
*  bodyguards here or there at various events. I, I'm not sure like they'd ever call me to be in one [[01:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5443.56s)]
*  of their movies. How do you maintain like what happens there? Well, you know, every, like I said, [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5448.12s)]
*  everybody I've worked for, we had a great relationship and we became friends. Like, [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5455.16s)]
*  like I said, it's Liza, my first, uh, my first client, uh, sliced lung became my friend. We [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5461.0s)]
*  became good friends and I just asked these people if they would, uh, come on, do my documentary and [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5467.0s)]
*  it was not, not, not one hesitation. Wow. Everybody came and, uh, and did it. And, uh, [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5472.68s)]
*  Cause you, in between the boxing and the martial arts and the body guarding, there was a stint. [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5478.76s)]
*  She mentioned Japan where you went, there was some brief time in the slammer. It was brief. [[01:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5484.2s)]
*  I spent a four months in a Japanese prison. Okay. Wasn't, wasn't good, but I was locked down 23 [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5490.04s)]
*  hours a day. So, and they put you out in Japan and then you had to come back here and go to jail. [[01:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5496.6s)]
*  Then I came back here, but, uh, the worst prison in the United States is like a country club compared [[01:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5501.96s)]
*  to Japan. Oh, really? Yeah. That was like my first time in jail. So I hope they're not all the [[01:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5507.64s)]
*  prisons like this. They were accusing you of a drug crime. Yes. Okay. I was indicted for making a [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5513.240000000001s)]
*  telephone call to a guy who sold a pound of methamphetamine. I never made the phone call. [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5518.76s)]
*  I was in British Columbia making a movie called year or dragon. I showed them my, my, my, my, my [[01:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5523.48s)]
*  receipts, my, my phone bills, everything, but they wanted me because at the time I was the president [[01:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5528.679999999999s)]
*  of the club and my club, you know, hell's end, the nomads and, uh, the government wants you to go and [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5533.0s)]

*  friends and all, of course, you know, I wouldn't. And I wound up getting, uh, a phone count is four [[01:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5544.28s)]
*  years. The judge gave me 10. Wow. So like 18 different prisons though in that 19. Why so many? [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5550.44s)]
*  Well, I had a few problems with some people and, uh, every time you have a fight, they transfer you [[01:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5559.879999999999s)]
*  because they don't want retaliation. So I had probably 10 good fights in prison. Yeah. [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5565.48s)]
*  The few people wasn't afraid going in. Yeah. But this becomes kind of relevant to your friendship [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5571.719999999999s)]
*  with Trump. I mean, when he got indicted on criminal charges for his alleged bookkeeping [[01:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5576.76s)]
*  errors, it must've struck home in a particular way. Like I said, I went through his trials and, uh, [[01:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5584.2s)]
*  we've been friends for a long time and what they've done to him, you could never, [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5589.88s)]
*  I would never imagine it in a, you know, a hundred years that they could do that to a [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5597.0s)]
*  former president and one who's running now. How'd you guys meet? We met at, uh, basically, uh, [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5602.12s)]

*  Because he was getting railroaded and I wanted to stick up for him. I stick up for my friends and [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5690.360000000001s)]

*  all these, you know, phony charges and everything. And we know that. So, uh, and we know, I don't [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5702.4400000000005s)]

*  President Trump was winning. We woke up and Biden was a president who never campaigned. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5722.12s)]
*  So it was all fixed. I say that and I still say it. And what did you think on November 5th, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5728.2s)]

*  had in the United States. He, he, he, uh, you know, promises and keeps it. And, uh, he's just great. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5751.32s)]
*  I mean, you spent a whole life between the hell's angels, not to mention the prison time, [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5761.72s)]
*  the boxing, the mixed martial arts, the body guarding. Yes. How does, I mean, Trump's also [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5766.52s)]

*  any other president or anybody else who we get shot, they'd be under that counter there. And that [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5782.04s)]
*  he got up, he's wait, wait, when he put up fight, fight, fight, he's just, I mean, there's nobody [[01:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5786.92s)]
*  like him. He's just so, so nothing faces them. I mean, uh, and they tried and you know what to get [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5793.88s)]

*  the first hour he was elected. I mean, he started signing the orders and he's going to change his [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5829.96s)]
*  country around back to where it was. Have you seen like a big change from the Donald Trump you knew [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5835.24s)]
*  back in the day at, you know, the cocktail lounges and the one who you see now? Oh, well, you know [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5840.679999999999s)]

*  nobody like him. And, uh, I love the guy. I mean, I'd do anything for him, but, uh, [[01:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5853.96s)]
*  we've never had a president like him. And you gotta realize years ago, [[01:37:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5859.8s)]
*  I never got involved with who was the president. Who cared? It wasn't to president Trump. It was [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5864.2s)]
*  the first time I ever voted. And I really first time I never cared before. And until the day he [[01:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5869.16s)]
*  became president, I mean, all those other people, all those woke people, all those phony people out [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5876.52s)]
*  there, they don't like them. But, uh, like I said, I never cared about who was president before, [[01:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5881.240000000001s)]
*  but they talked since the day he became president. They have not stopped talking about him. [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5887.96s)]
*  All these every day you heard president Trump, president Trump and everything else. But as far [[01:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5893.0s)]
*  as I'm concerned, he's the greatest president we ever had. Well, he obviously, and he's for [[01:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5899.160000000001s)]
*  the American people in America. And he's for you because I mean, he's very busy man to take the [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5903.16s)]
*  time out to appear in this film. All these people, I think that's something extraordinary about you, [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHzb9MNWEuU&t=5908.28s)]
