Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Tucker Carlson, host of "The Tucker Carlson Show" to discuss Michelle Obama’s shocking comments about fears over Trump's immigration policy on Jay Shetty’s podcast, her constant negativity and complaining, her hostility and resentment towards her husband and why happy marriages make happy people, her disdain for America, who could be the future of the Democratic party, ridiculous comments from JB Pritzker, the strategy behind Gavin Newsom's podcast and his total lack of principles, whether AOC could really be a 2028 player, the truth about Iran and Russia, what America should do about the Houthis, how much of what the DC establishment on both sides are disconnected from reality and American interests, a response to those critiquing him as anti-American, the fallout from the "Signalgate" scandal, what's actually happening with Pete Hegesth inside the Pentagon, Trump’s continued public support of Hegseth while the alleged leakers speak out to Tucker and Megyn, his frustration over the rate of deportations so far in the first 100 days, what he thinks would be a better approach, and more. Then Dr. Robert Marbut and actor Billy Baldwin join to talk about their new film "Fentanyl: Death Incorporated," the fentanyl epidemic in America, why the problem affects all demographics, how the Canadian border plays a factor to the crisis, personal stories of accidental deaths, and more.

# Tucker Carlson on Michelle, Newsom, AOC, and Fentanyl Crisis in America, w/ Billy Baldwin and More
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 29, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Today, officially marking [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=0.0s)]
*  President Trump's 100th day in office. What a whirlwind. The White House is branding it [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  100 days of promises made, promises kept, with the president's biggest accomplishments [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  centered on immigration and the border and how. Also, Michelle Obama is once again out [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=15.92s)]
*  there whining about what a victim she is. This time, she's trying to suggest that her [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=24.68s)]
*  daughters could be arrested in the middle of the night and deported along with some [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=30.2s)]
*  random illegals. At least that's how I read her comments. That seems like as good a place [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=34.8s)]
*  as any to kick off the show as we're joined today by Tucker Carlson, host of the Tucker [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=40.08s)]
*  Carlson show and a good friend. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=44.760000000000005s)]
*  Paleo Valley makes 100% grass-fed beef sticks because healthy living should be easy and [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=54.760000000000005s)]
*  accessible for everyone. If you are constantly on the move, working, traveling, raising a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=61.480000000000004s)]
*  family, consider checking out Paleo Valley. You get clean, high quality nutrition, not [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=65.52000000000001s)]
*  the chemical-laden garbage so many brands are selling. And here's the truth. Most of [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=70.76s)]
*  the so-called healthy beef sticks you're going to find at big box stores loaded with preservatives, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=74.68s)]
*  not Paleo Valley. They use old world fermentation methods to keep their sticks fresh without [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=80.84s)]
*  chemicals. Paleo Valley beef sticks come in five delicious flavors. They went over huge [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=86.68s)]
*  in my house and are made from grass-fed beef sourced from regenerative American farms. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=92.36s)]
*  No MSG, no gluten, no sugar, just real nutrient-dense food. Over 55 million beef sticks sold and [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=98.28s)]
*  Paleo Valley stands behind every single one of them with a 60-day money-back guarantee. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=105.28s)]
*  Right now you can get 20% off your first order. Go to paleovalley.com slash megan [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=110.2s)]
*  and use the code MEGAN for your order. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=116.04s)]
*  Great to see you Tucker. How are you? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=119.04s)]
*  You're making me laugh, Megan. I hadn't read that. I'm grateful to be here. Michelle Obama, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=121.04s)]
*  you go to Princeton for free and you're just, by the way, I can't imagine that she qualified [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=126.84s)]
*  on the merits to go to Princeton, but you have everything handed to you for free and [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=133.36s)]
*  you're just enraged at the country. There's a deep lesson here actually. Yes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=137.84s)]
*  Let me play the sound bite because it's even worse than you're imagining. She went on this [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=142.84s)]
*  guy Jay Shetty's podcast and he asked her something about her greatest fear as of late [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=148.24s)]
*  and here's what she said. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=153.52s)]
*  This current climate for me, it's what's happening to immigrants. It's not the fear for myself [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=155.52s)]
*  anymore. I drive around in a four-car motorcade with a police escort. I'm Michelle Obama. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=163.52s)]
*  I do still worry about my daughters in the world, even though they are somewhat recognizable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=169.52s)]
*  So my fears are for what I know is happening out there in streets all over the city. And [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=174.52s)]
*  now that we have leadership that is sort of indiscriminately determining who belongs and [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=181.52s)]
*  who doesn't, and we know that those decisions aren't being made with courts and with due [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=186.52s)]
*  process and that it's being made like this cop that pulled my brother over when he was [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=192.52s)]
*  12. You don't look like somebody that belongs. I can determine just by looking at you that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=199.52s)]
*  you're a good person or you're not a good person. And knowing that there's so much bias [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=208.52s)]
*  and so much racism and so much ignorance that fuels those kind of choices. I worry for [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=214.52s)]
*  people of color all over this country. And I don't know that we will have the advocates [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=221.52s)]
*  to protect everybody. And that makes me, that frightens me. It keeps me up at night. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=227.52s)]
*  How do you feel comfortable going to work, going to school when you know that there could [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=234.52s)]
*  be people out here judging you and who could upend your life in a second? That, you know, [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=240.52s)]
*  that's who I worry for right now. There's so much in there, Tucker. I'll let you take [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=248.52s)]
*  a swing at it first. My first response is it feels so antique. It feels so 2017. It's [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=255.52s)]
*  like literally nobody cares. Nobody cares at all. All of those talking about people [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=263.52s)]
*  of color under attack. No, they're not. They're coming here by the millions because this is [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=268.52s)]
*  the safest country for everybody no matter what your color is or it was in any case. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=274.52s)]
*  So, like, that's just so old fashioned. I mean, it's really like you expect her to say, [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=279.52s)]
*  let me fax you my thoughts on this. Because it's just like she's so out of it. The second [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=286.52s)]
*  thing is that, like, we always beat up on, you know, rich white ladies because they're [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=291.52s)]
*  the most disruptive force in America. But that's unfair. It's not about color. There's [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=295.52s)]
*  something about the people with the most in our country that's really poisonous. They're [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=301.52s)]
*  the unhappiest or the most restless. They're the most self-involved. They're the least [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=306.52s)]
*  generous. They're the most annoying. And it's not just a gender thing. It's men too. But [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=311.52s)]
*  there's something about America at this moment where the unhappiest people are also the most [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=315.52s)]
*  privileged. And I think it does tell you something deep about accumulating money or worshiping [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=321.52s)]
*  money. It, like, doesn't fill the empty space at all. It doesn't, you know, Larry Fink is [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=325.52s)]
*  a miserable person in real life despite having billions of dollars. And of course, you know, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=330.52s)]
*  personally, and I do too, a lot of deeply unhappy billionaires way more unhappy than the guy [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=335.52s)]
*  fixing your air conditioning. So there is, like, it's a theological principle that I think [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=340.52s)]
*  is worth saying out loud. Worshiping money, worshiping power, organizing your life so you [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=345.52s)]
*  get more of both does not give you peace or happiness. In fact, it seems to produce the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=351.52s)]
*  opposite. People like Michelle Obama who's drowning in Lake Me. I mean, Michelle Obama is [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=357.52s)]
*  literally going down for the third time into this pool of self-involvement and you just you don't [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=363.52s)]
*  think she's going to come up again. Like she's dying of affluence, privilege and self-obsession, [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=369.52s)]
*  obviously. Everything she says is negative. We've been watching clips from her podcast over the [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=375.52s)]
*  past couple of weeks. Everything she says is negative. I mean, you would never know you are [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=382.52s)]
*  hearing from a woman who is first lady for eight years has become probably a billionaire by this [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=388.52s)]
*  point is out on David Geffen's yacht every other summer, her estate Martha's Vineyard, her [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=394.52s)]
*  daughters who went to these Tony schools. You would think you were listening to somebody [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=400.52s)]
*  basically like another like the wife of a George Floyd and she's never gotten over right. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=405.52s)]
*  Whatever grievance she had growing up. I love how the soundbite begins. Okay, it's not the fear for [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=411.52s)]
*  myself. I drive around in a four car motorcade with the police escort. I'm Michelle Obama. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=417.52s)]
*  Unbelievable, right? Who talks about themselves that way? Even if you are Michelle Obama, you [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=423.52s)]
*  Barack Obama doesn't talk about himself that way. It's just like the hubris and then this is the [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=429.52s)]
*  part that jumped out to me more than any other. I do still worry about my daughters in the world [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=434.52s)]
*  even though they are somewhat recognizable. In other words, she's worried that is mixed race girls. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=440.52s)]
*  They're going to get picked up like Kilmar, a brego Garcia, an MS 13 gang member and whisked off [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=446.52s)]
*  to El Salvador. That is what she's saying. Tucker and you know what? I think she is lying there at [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=453.52s)]
*  night thinking that. That's what she thinks of America. Of course she is. Of course. But she's just so [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=459.52s)]
*  miserable and it's obvious and always has been. I do think maybe another. So you look at something like [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=465.52s)]
*  that and you're like, okay, what are the lessons for me? You look at other people's lives and they [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=470.52s)]
*  either go up or down. They succeed or they fail and you try to take important lessons for yourself in [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=474.52s)]
*  your own life. One of the lessons that I've always thought Michelle Obama's life presented to the rest [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=479.52s)]
*  of us is take some time to focus on your marriage. If you're happy in your marriage, you can feel it, [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=484.52s)]
*  you can smell it. You're emanating a kind of peace of tranquility. You're going home to a spiritual fortress [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=490.52s)]
*  with your spouse and people who have deeply unhappy marriages and everyone's been through periods of [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=496.52s)]
*  unhappiness and you know there's nothing more destabilizing than that. You do feel like for the [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=503.52s)]
*  grasping, climbing, acquiring class, in which she's a charter member, there's no time to focus on [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=509.52s)]
*  this one person in your own home or maybe even your own children. They're all about, I want to deal [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=516.52s)]
*  with Netflix and I want a Kennedy Center Honors Award and me, me, me, me, me, me, me, and they sort of [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=522.52s)]
*  miss the point which is in a normal life your marriage is the core of everything. A happy marriage [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=528.52s)]
*  produces happy people and happy children. And I just don't think she spent a lot of time on that. I mean she [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=535.52s)]
*  really dislikes her husband, super obvious. I'm not just saying that to be catty. I'm trying to feel [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=540.52s)]
*  compassion for her but her hostility toward the guy is like unbelievable and it's been obvious since- [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=545.52s)]
*  Everything she says is negative. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=550.52s)]
*  About him for sure. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=552.52s)]
*  I can't even think of one negative comment you've ever made about Suzy. I almost never say negative [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=554.52s)]
*  things about Doug. Yeah, exactly. It's not like they're perfect. It's just like when I think about him [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=560.52s)]
*  I don't immediately go to whatever's negative. I go to what's positive and what I love about him and [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=565.52s)]
*  there's a ton. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=569.52s)]
*  Well actually, last time I saw you, you said you were off camera telling me how great Doug is. I mean [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=570.52s)]
*  it's a fact. I remember it really vividly. In fact, I told my wife about it. No, those are the markers [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=576.52s)]
*  of actual success. Is your marriage happy? Are your children thriving? Are your relationships solid? [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=583.52s)]
*  Like the people around you in your orbit and you feel like in her case, boy the answer is no, but it's not [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=589.52s)]
*  just her. I mean she's like a freak show and it's easy to make fun of her and I enjoy it but I do think it's a [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=594.52s)]
*  whole class of people who are afflicted with the same kind of restlessness and rage and emptiness and they're [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=601.52s)]
*  the ones wrecking our society. It's not the people at the bottom, it's the people at the top and they have [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=608.52s)]
*  gone way off the rails and she's like a perfect example of it in my opinion. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=614.52s)]
*  Well you know, this is a good lead into Governor Pritzker of Illinois. I mean talk about excesses, right? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=619.52s)]
*  All the seven sins are walking all over him. You just take a look at him. It's like you can see multiple of [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=627.52s)]
*  them and he's out there now. I mean I guess he fancies himself a contender for 28 and has decided to ratchet [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=634.52s)]
*  up the rhetoric. It wasn't enough for him to try to trans all of our children, he and his weird family. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=640.52s)]
*  But this is his latest messaging as he went through New Hampshire this past Sunday, stop 12. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=645.52s)]
*  Never before in my life have I called for mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption, but I am now. [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=652.52s)]
*  These Republicans cannot know a moment of peace. They have to understand that we will fight their cruelty with [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=670.52s)]
*  every megaphone and microphone that we have. We must castigate them on the soapbox and then punish them at the ballot box. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=684.52s)]
*  I mean he's looking at us like we're a couple of Twinkies. I'm afraid. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=692.52s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, sorry it took me a second. I mean there's another man in misery, you know what I mean, an inherited [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=701.52s)]
*  money person who has never achieved anything and who is inflicting his own personal torment on the rest of us. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=712.52s)]
*  But he says I've never called for disruption. It does raise the other question I always have about the people running everything, [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=719.52s)]
*  which is what have you built? What have you created? What have you improved? I mean it is a binary. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=724.52s)]
*  We're either in this life, on this planet, making things better or making them worse, building or destroying. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=729.52s)]
*  What have you done for the state of Illinois, which is bankrupt, there's been an exodus of normal people, people with jobs, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=734.52s)]
*  people with families, they're on the west coast of Florida right now. Like that state is wrecked, it's not all his fault of course. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=741.52s)]
*  But why don't you tell me three things you've done to improve Illinois? There aren't any. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=747.52s)]
*  So for him to say I've never called for disruption before, it's like that's actually all you've done. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=750.52s)]
*  All you've done is advocated for the destruction of children and families through the transing stuff, [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=755.52s)]
*  through advocate for the destruction of your state, through your total mismanagement of it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=759.52s)]
*  It's like how could someone like that or Gavin Newsom or anyone else with a track record, an unbroken record of destruction, [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=765.52s)]
*  with a straight face say hey, give me a bigger job. Like I just think the whole thing is deranged. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=771.52s)]
*  We should hire on the basis of achievement. We should reward people on the basis of achievement across the board, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=776.52s)]
*  whether it's getting into Princeton, whether it's becoming president. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=782.52s)]
*  Like if you have no record of achievement, I'm sorry, we're not going to consider you, period. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=785.52s)]
*  What do you make of what Gavin Newsom is doing right now with his podcast? [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=791.52s)]
*  Because I've said I'm against conservatives going on his podcast because I think it's helping him train for 2028. [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=796.52s)]
*  I don't think we should help him. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=804.52s)]
*  I agree. I agree completely. I didn't think that I know, obviously I know Gavin Newsom. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=805.52s)]
*  I text with him occasionally. I am from the state of California. I'm from originally San Francisco. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=810.52s)]
*  So I have relatives who know him. So I've been through with Gavin Newsom for a long time. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=816.52s)]
*  I know his ex-wife. And I have been bothering him for years, like you should come on my show. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=821.52s)]
*  And he was kind of open to it. And then he whips around and he's like, no, you should come on mine. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=826.52s)]
*  I was like, oh, I would love to, because I would love to debate him about what he's done to my state. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=830.52s)]
*  And then I watched a parade of people go on, some of whom are good friends of mine, by the way, conservatives go on his show. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=834.52s)]
*  And I realized, and I'm not attacking them at all. I almost did. But then I realized, oh, wait a second. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=841.52s)]
*  This is like, this is not the point of this is not to have a real conversation or to answer questions. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=847.52s)]
*  The point of this is to rehabilitate. And I would say if Gavin, like he's legit smart. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=854.52s)]
*  I don't think there's anything at all at the core other than misery. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=858.52s)]
*  Another deeply, deeply unhappy person who, you know, we should be rooting for him to get his life together. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=863.52s)]
*  But someone who kind of externalizes everything, you know, there's nothing at the center. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=869.52s)]
*  And so everything is about the public display. A truly wounded, screwed up person, like on a very deep level, not joking, but also a talented person who will say anything, which in politics is an advantage. [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=873.52s)]
*  If you will just if you're willing to say anything, I mean, there's things that you will not say. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=886.52s)]
*  Yeah, many of them, because you don't believe them. And maybe, you know, I'll speak for myself. [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=889.52s)]
*  Like there are sometimes where I've got strong views on something and I'm like, you know, you should just shut up and keep that to yourself because you will just alienate everybody. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=893.52s)]
*  And like you don't need to express everything that you think. I tell myself that a lot because I have some views that are super unpopular. [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=900.52s)]
*  OK, but I will never say something that I don't believe. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=905.52s)]
*  That's got to be the line. But there's no line at all with him, like none. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=909.52s)]
*  And so, wow, it's kind of hard. It's kind of hard. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=914.52s)]
*  You'd be like, you know, Gavin Newsom, you just robbed a liquor store. [[00:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=917.52s)]
*  He's standing there with a gun in his hand, a fistful of 20s. And he's like, no, I didn't. [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=920.52s)]
*  You did. And you're like, what? [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=924.52s)]
*  It's postmodern. It's very hard to debate someone like that. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=927.52s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=932.52s)]
*  So you don't see him as the Dems great white hope from California for 2028. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=934.52s)]
*  He's pretty white. I mean, it's the anti-white party. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=939.52s)]
*  Like they hate white people. They've been systematically disenfranchising white people from the country they were born in. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=942.52s)]
*  They say that out loud. That's what diversity is. It's everybody but white men. [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=949.52s)]
*  So I'm not whining about it. I'm just noticing that much more comprehensive than Jim Crow ever was. [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=953.52s)]
*  And so for the party that did that, that set up this Jim Crow system, anti-white system, to nominate another white guy, I mean, maybe. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=959.52s)]
*  But I think they'd be much happier with AOC. I don't take her that seriously. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=967.52s)]
*  I'm not really sure what I think. I think what is likely to happen. Yeah. [[00:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=974.52s)]
*  Someone's going to come out of nowhere who's got native talent. [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=979.52s)]
*  I continue to believe even in the Democratic Party, you have to have talent to succeed. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=982.52s)]
*  I felt that Bernie Sanders had a lot of talent. I don't agree with him, of course, but I did think he had a lot of talent. [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=987.52s)]
*  And then it turned out he was a fraud also. But someone like Bernie Sanders, I think populist economics is very popular, actually. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=992.52s)]
*  Conservatives don't want to admit it, but it is popular. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1000.52s)]
*  So someone that comes out and attacks the credit card companies, attacks the endless war, basically does kind of trump on the left. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1002.52s)]
*  That person could easily get elected. I don't think the race stuff has a future. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1010.52s)]
*  Well, the problem with AOC is there is a kind of unseriousness about her. I think she's an amazing performer. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1015.52s)]
*  I think she's attractive. I think she's different. I think she's got a ton of talent. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1023.52s)]
*  I'm not I'm actually not criticizing AOC. I'm complimenting her sincerely. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1028.52s)]
*  But I think she's too much about herself. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1031.52s)]
*  And I think that it takes enormous self-discipline to get through a presidential campaign. [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1035.52s)]
*  And I don't know that she has that. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1040.52s)]
*  And I also think the Israel thing is tough, is tough for anybody running in that party. [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1042.52s)]
*  You know, a lot of rank and file Democrats are genuinely mad about the Gaza thing. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1047.52s)]
*  Donors obviously are on a different page. [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1051.52s)]
*  So it's a it's a fundamental split in that party. [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1054.52s)]
*  And I'm not exactly sure how that's resolved or and I'm not sure that she can can walk that line. [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1057.52s)]
*  And who will be on the opposite side? [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1063.52s)]
*  Will it be President Trump for a third term? [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1065.52s)]
*  Because he's he hasn't totally ruled it out. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1067.52s)]
*  Even with his interview, he just gave to the Atlantic. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1070.52s)]
*  He said, oh, you know, that that would be a norm shattering. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1072.52s)]
*  But maybe I'm about the shattering. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1075.52s)]
*  He seems to just be toying with people on this. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1077.52s)]
*  But I think I think we I think we both think it's probably going to be JD. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1079.52s)]
*  Don't you think? [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1083.52s)]
*  Well, I would say was with some certainty as of today, I mean, boy, things are so dynamic. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1086.52s)]
*  It's like hard even to know where things are going a lot of the time. [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1091.52s)]
*  But, you know, if the Republican Party still has standing in the eyes of voters, and I think it will a couple of years from now, JD is the you know, is the is the obvious. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1094.52s)]
*  I mean, he's the most articulate explainer, I think, of Donald Trump's ideas. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1104.52s)]
*  He's the most powerful and effective vice president in my lifetime for sure. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1109.52s)]
*  And he has managed to do that while remaining completely loyal on the same page as Donald Trump, not undermining him. [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1116.52s)]
*  I mean, that's always the tension between president and vice president. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1123.52s)]
*  You know, the vice president has his own aspirations. [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1126.52s)]
*  And so he's sort of subtly undermining the president. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1129.52s)]
*  That has not happened at all. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1132.52s)]
*  And I don't expect that it will. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1134.52s)]
*  So, yeah, I mean, I think JD is the obvious. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1136.52s)]
*  I mean, it's certainly not going to be Nikki Haley. [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1138.52s)]
*  Like, let's be real. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1140.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1141.52s)]
*  That was tried and failed. [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1142.52s)]
*  What did you think of the I haven't spoken to you publicly since then. [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1143.52s)]
*  What did you think of the scene with JD and Trump and Zelensky in the Oval? [[00:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1146.52s)]
*  Well, I thought it was amazing. [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1152.52s)]
*  I thought it was amazing. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1154.52s)]
*  I mean, I'm frustrated because I think that Zelensky is an enemy of the United States. [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1155.52s)]
*  And I think his government has tried to assassinate a number of people. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1159.52s)]
*  I don't think that I know that, including some people who are trying to kill him. [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1163.52s)]
*  I think it's a really, really dark government. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1167.52s)]
*  It's banned the largest Christian denomination in Ukraine that has sold a lot of the weapons [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1170.52s)]
*  that we have sent them to all kinds of dark groups, including Hamas and the Mexican drug cartels. [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1175.52s)]
*  Like, I think it's an outlawed government that does not represent Ukrainians. [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1180.52s)]
*  He's not an elected president. [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1183.52s)]
*  He has no moral claim to run that country at all. [[00:19:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1185.52s)]
*  So, you know, I'm always a little distressed when he's treated as a legitimate president, [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1189.52s)]
*  which he's not. [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1193.52s)]
*  But, you know, that said, he was in the Oval. [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1194.52s)]
*  Like, that was not, you know, I didn't have any control over any of that. [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1196.52s)]
*  I didn't want to be in the Oval in the first place. [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1199.52s)]
*  Like, hey, why don't you stand for election? [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1200.52s)]
*  And when you win, then we'll treat you like a head of state. [[00:20:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1202.52s)]
*  But you're not a head of state because he's not. [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1204.52s)]
*  So that's my personal view. [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1206.52s)]
*  But given that, I was thrilled to see Donald Trump. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1207.52s)]
*  I think that was genuine peak. [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1212.52s)]
*  Like, we just sent you billions and billions of dollars. [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1214.52s)]
*  You stole a lot of it. [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1216.52s)]
*  How many houses do you have, Zelensky, by the way? [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1217.52s)]
*  Do you have a house in my area? [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1219.52s)]
*  Do you have one in France? [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1220.52s)]
*  Like, what, you know, let's actually do an audit of your personal finances [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1221.52s)]
*  and of putting off and all the people around you. [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1225.52s)]
*  And like, let's find out where the money went. [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1227.52s)]
*  That's never been done. [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1229.52s)]
*  It's never going to be done because a lot of Americans have gotten rich from it, too. [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1230.52s)]
*  As I know, you know, it's a money laundering scheme. [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1233.52s)]
*  But with that all in mind, and of course, the president knows all that, [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1235.52s)]
*  for Zelensky to be like, well, you owe me more money or else big problems for you. [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1238.52s)]
*  I mean, I think that just that just exploded Trump's brain. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1242.52s)]
*  I think he was genuinely outraged. [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1246.52s)]
*  How dare this guy talk to me? [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1248.52s)]
*  This, you know, dictator of a client state talked to me that way. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1250.52s)]
*  So, you know, I hope that U.S. policymakers will keep that in mind going forward. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1254.52s)]
*  This guy is not our ally at all. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1260.52s)]
*  He's trashing the United States constantly, constantly trying to split Europe from the United States. [[00:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1262.52s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1267.52s)]
*  And there are so many people in the national media who are trying to get the money. [[00:21:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1268.52s)]
*  Oh, my gosh. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1273.52s)]
*  And there are so many people in the national security state who are so vested in this and who've gotten rich from it that they won't admit it. [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1274.52s)]
*  And the whole system is like on autopilot, like Zelensky runs Ukraine. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1281.52s)]
*  Ukraine is our ally. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1284.52s)]
*  Russia is our enemy. [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1285.52s)]
*  It's like, what? [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1286.52s)]
*  We just waged a three and a half year war against Russia without congressional approval. [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1288.52s)]
*  The United States has been fighting a war as we speak is fighting a war against Russia. [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1292.52s)]
*  No American voted for this. [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1296.52s)]
*  Most Americans don't want it or can feel like, why are we fighting Russia again? [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1297.52s)]
*  Why are they our enemy? [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1300.52s)]
*  Why are they our enemy? [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1301.52s)]
*  Because a small group of people hates Russia for reasons that they never say out loud. [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1302.52s)]
*  That has a lot to do with the re-emergence of Christianity in Russia. [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1306.52s)]
*  They hate that. [[00:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1309.52s)]
*  And they've roped the rest of us with our tax dollars into supporting this war that we lost. [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1310.52s)]
*  We lost the war. [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1316.52s)]
*  And we degraded U.S. authority and military power in the process. [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1318.52s)]
*  We pushed Russia into a permanent alliance with China. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1322.52s)]
*  It's been a disaster for the United States. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1326.52s)]
*  And nobody has admitted that, said that out loud. [[00:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1328.52s)]
*  And they haven't even changed course. [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1330.52s)]
*  And so it's extremely frustrating to watch. [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1332.52s)]
*  So what do you think is going to happen now? [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1335.52s)]
*  Trump's messaging just this week and Marco Rubio's messaging this week has changed to be a little bit more. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1337.52s)]
*  They're still kind of hopeful, but they sound somewhat exasperated. [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1343.52s)]
*  Like, look, we're not in this for much longer. [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1347.52s)]
*  If you guys can't work this out, we're out. [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1350.52s)]
*  This is your conflict, which basically means Ukraine's F'd because we know the Europeans won't step up in the way the United States did. [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1351.52s)]
*  So it's over. [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1358.52s)]
*  I mean, I think it's really playing the Trump card on Ukraine. [[00:22:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1359.52s)]
*  Like, you will take the deal under the terms we've said are acceptable or you're on your own, which means your loss, which has already happened, will be official, pronounced and actually could get even worse. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1362.52s)]
*  I mean, I think it's really dangerous to do it this way. [[00:22:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1374.52s)]
*  I think we should have cut off Ukraine day one, forced a settlement of our choosing in conjunction with the Russians who won. [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1378.52s)]
*  So in the end, let's be totally honest, the winner sets the terms like that's just a fact. [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1384.52s)]
*  We could try to guide those terms, but we're not in a position of absolute authority in Eastern Europe right now. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1388.52s)]
*  It's just a fact. [[00:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1392.52s)]
*  I wish we were, but we're not. [[00:23:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1393.52s)]
*  So, but I do think the longer this goes on, the higher the incentive for Zelensky and the people around him to drag the rest of the world into this, to commit some serious atrocity in Moscow. [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1394.52s)]
*  And by the way, I was there. [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1405.52s)]
*  I saw with my own eyes, they sent a drone in and attacked the Kremlin. [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1407.52s)]
*  And of course the Russians didn't want to admit that because they don't want to admit that their capital city is vulnerable to attack. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1412.52s)]
*  But that's a fact. [[00:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1417.52s)]
*  I saw it on fire and every Russian I asked denied that it was happening. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1418.52s)]
*  I was like, wait, there's a look at that. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1422.52s)]
*  But that was Ukrainian drone and there have been a bunch of them. [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1424.52s)]
*  And those are American drones. [[00:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1426.52s)]
*  So the United States under Joe Biden attacked the Russian capital. [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1429.52s)]
*  This is so crazy. [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1433.52s)]
*  And the Russians for their own who are not always honest about things to be honest, you know, to be clear, they have downplayed that because a bunch of different complicated reasons. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1434.52s)]
*  But that's all true. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1444.52s)]
*  And so the Zelensky government has incentive to do more of that. [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1446.52s)]
*  And you could really see this thing getting completely out of control. [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1450.52s)]
*  And like, why wouldn't China, North Korea has already sent troops onto the battlefield in Ukraine. [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1453.52s)]
*  Why wouldn't China do that? [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1458.52s)]
*  So you could have a scenario where the United States American advisors, we have a million Americans fighting in that war, as you know, they lie about it, but it's true. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1459.52s)]
*  They're in Ukraine fighting and European troops, NATO troops and Ukrainian troops are fighting Chinese troops. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1467.52s)]
*  Well, you know, this could get out of control super fast. [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1474.52s)]
*  Everyone thinks, oh, I know how this is going to go. [[00:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1477.52s)]
*  And like, this is what's going to happen. [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1479.52s)]
*  Like some Rube Goldberg set up and then this is going to happen. [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1481.52s)]
*  That'll happen. It's like, dude, you have no idea what's going to happen. [[00:24:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1484.52s)]
*  You don't know what you're having for dinner tonight. [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1487.52s)]
*  The future is not under our control at all. [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1489.52s)]
*  And so anyone who tells you like, here's how it's going to go is a liar or dumb. [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1492.52s)]
*  These are dynamic situations and they could go in a crazy unanticipated direction. [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1496.52s)]
*  There's one lesson of history. [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1502.52s)]
*  It's that. So you want to shut down the fighting as fast as you can. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1503.52s)]
*  And I really hope they will. [[00:25:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1507.52s)]
*  I don't want to put you on the spot, but you did pique my curiosity with the they've tried to have people assassinated in leadership as a whole. [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1509.52s)]
*  I mean, I mean, I think you did in leadership positions or like, do you mean Trump? [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1516.52s)]
*  Do you mean are you talking about yourself? [[00:25:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1523.52s)]
*  I couldn't I couldn't quite glean what you were intimating on that one. [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1524.52s)]
*  I mean, I would just say that I don't know that they've been responsible for an assassination attempt on Donald Trump. [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1527.52s)]
*  I can't prove that. [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1536.52s)]
*  I think it's very obvious that the Ukrainians were involved in the attempted assassination on the golf course golf course in Florida this fall. [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1537.52s)]
*  And you were in contact with Ukraine for sure. [[00:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1544.52s)]
*  Well, he was it. He was in Ukraine. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1546.52s)]
*  He was in Ukraine and he was asking members of Congress ballistic missiles or rocket propelled grenades. [[00:25:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1548.52s)]
*  Yes, that's exactly right. [[00:25:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1555.52s)]
*  And I think there are others who were the target. [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1556.52s)]
*  I mean, I know for a fact there were others who were a target of assassinate a nation attempts by the Ukrainian government. [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1559.52s)]
*  And by the way, just to be clear, the Ukrainian government, like the U.S. [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1565.52s)]
*  Government, like every government has factions within it. [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1568.52s)]
*  It doesn't mean if one part of the government does something that everyone the rest of the government knows it's doing it. [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1570.52s)]
*  I mean, there are it's complicated. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1575.52s)]
*  Did the CIA kill Kennedy? [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1577.52s)]
*  No, but it's pretty clear that James Angleton was aware of it who worked at CIA. [[00:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1578.52s)]
*  So it's like it's more complicated. [[00:26:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1584.52s)]
*  I don't mean to oversimplify anything, but it's it's a it's a fact that elements of the Ukrainian government have tried to assassinate a bunch of people. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1586.52s)]
*  And so there you go. [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1596.52s)]
*  And I and I think starting with with the with the now president and I'm not exactly sure why we haven't gotten to the bottom of that. [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1599.52s)]
*  I mean, you know, encouraged it on my show. [[00:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1606.52s)]
*  I think I think we do need to get to the bottom of it. [[00:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1608.52s)]
*  I don't know where that investigation is. [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1610.52s)]
*  I don't know where the Butler, Pennsylvania investigation is. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1612.52s)]
*  I mean, there are so many question obvious unanswered questions. [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1614.52s)]
*  We know more about Kilmar Abrego Garcia than we know about that shooter in Butler, Pennsylvania. [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1616.52s)]
*  I know I know more about Dr. [[00:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1618.52s)]
*  Jill Biden's college career than I, which is like totally useless information, by the way, than I do about two assassination attempts on the now president. [[00:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1620.52s)]
*  So I think it's very strange. [[00:27:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1624.52s)]
*  I'm not withholding something I know. [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1626.52s)]
*  I really don't know why. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1628.52s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:27:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1630.52s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1632.52s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1634.52s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1636.52s)]
*  I don't know why. [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1638.52s)]
* atan [[00:27:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1640.52s)]
*  done [[00:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1656.28s)]
*  ? [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1658.6s)]
*  For the rest of us to ask, like, what was that? [[00:27:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1661.02s)]
*  If the head of state lives in fear of assassination, you just you can't because no one can think clearer or make [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1665.02s)]
*  because no one can think clearly or make, you know, wise decisions under the threat of death. [[00:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1668.02s)]
*  So we need to get that settled, I think, soon. [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1673.1399999999999s)]
*  Well, while we're on the subject of foreign policy, let's take a minute on the Houthis and Iran. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1677.1399999999999s)]
*  And that's a loud war machine, too. I mean, there is definitely a faction of people who would love [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1685.22s)]
*  to see the green light on either us hitting Iran or just backing Israel and hitting Iran. [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1690.66s)]
*  And the Houthis are backed by Iran, so that was playing with fire. I understand why we did it, [[00:28:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1696.6599999999999s)]
*  totally. But, you know, I just wonder, I haven't heard you speak directly to that attack or the [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1700.82s)]
*  language that we've been hearing around Iran, even by the president. Like, I don't want to bomb them, [[00:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1706.26s)]
*  I'd much rather chat. But, you know, it's an option, which I know you're against. So can [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1710.26s)]
*  you talk about that a bit? Well, I think, I mean, look, just in an ideal world, I think Iran is a [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1714.82s)]
*  threat to Israel. I think it's a threat to the Gulf states, all six of them were allied with [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1720.34s)]
*  those countries. I think they've been really good partners for us. And so it's not a defense of Iran [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1725.62s)]
*  to ask the question, can we actually do this? I mean, there are all kinds of things that you [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1730.02s)]
*  want to do. The question is, am I capable of doing them? Do I have the power to affect the change I [[00:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1733.78s)]
*  seek? And in the case of Iran, you know, it's not at all clear. What is clear is that any strike on [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1739.3799999999999s)]
*  Iran could potentially, because the future, as noted, is hard to predict, could potentially spin [[00:29:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1745.54s)]
*  into a much wider, potentially global conflict. But even in the short term, there are massive, [[00:29:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1751.86s)]
*  massive downsides. So there are what, six Iranian nuclear facilities that we know about, or we talk [[00:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1757.06s)]
*  about in public anyway, and all six of them are on the Gulf, the Arabian Gulf or the Persian Gulf, [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1762.02s)]
*  depending on what side you're on. But they're on the Gulf. Well, the water supply for every country [[00:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1766.26s)]
*  in the region comes from the Gulf through desalinization. So if you blow up a nuclear site [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1770.02s)]
*  and you pollute the Persian Gulf, then you've got six of the richest countries in the world with no [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1775.9399999999998s)]
*  water. And at least one of them has thought this through and has been building giant reservoirs [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1781.38s)]
*  for seawater, for drinking water, but they're only a couple weeks supply. So like, the second [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1786.74s)]
*  point you make is that a huge percentage of global energy goes through that piece of water, [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1793.22s)]
*  you know, out to the Straits of Hormuz and then to the west, to Europe and the United States and to [[00:29:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1798.66s)]
*  the world. And so if you shut that down, you're looking at global oil price, you're looking at [[00:30:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1802.42s)]
*  $25 gallon gasoline, right? So that's the fastest, most destructive kind of inflation that percolates [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1808.26s)]
*  down through the whole economy, because the price of energy determines the price of pretty much [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1814.58s)]
*  everything, because energy makes civilization possible. So that's a really big downside. I'm [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1818.5s)]
*  not saying it's not, you know, it's not a question of like, are you happy that Iran might have nukes? [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1823.3s)]
*  I'm not happy that Pakistan has nukes. There are also, there's at least one other country that [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1828.58s)]
*  clearly has nukes that nobody says out loud. I'm not talking about Israel, but you know, [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1832.66s)]
*  it's a more complicated world. Like, France has nukes. Is France doing deals with other countries [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1837.22s)]
*  that guarantee nuclear protection for other countries? Probably. You know, so there's, [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1843.8600000000001s)]
*  proliferation is a lot more profound a problem than I think people understand. So, but anyway, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1848.26s)]
*  no one wants Iran to have nukes. No one in the Gulf does. Israel doesn't. Trump doesn't. I don't. [[00:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1853.46s)]
*  You don't. Nobody wants Iran to have nukes. The question is, how do we stop that? And I don't [[00:30:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1857.7s)]
*  really think it's about nukes. I think it's about regime change in Iran, that this government is [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1862.9s)]
*  hostile to the West, hostile to Israel, primarily, but also to the United States, they are. And we [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1867.6200000000001s)]
*  would like a new government there that can be our friend. Now, there's a long history in Iran, [[00:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1872.9s)]
*  going back to 1954, where the US government did affect regime change, as you know, in fact, [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1878.02s)]
*  the guy in charge that lived on my street as a kid, former CIA officer, Roosevelt, and that didn't [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1883.8600000000001s)]
*  work well. And that got us to the Shah, and then to 1979, and then the Islamic Republic ever since. [[00:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1890.1s)]
*  So like, we, it's hard to affect regime change in countries you're not from. It's hard to know what [[00:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1894.98s)]
*  the consequences will be. We've tampered in that country extensively. It hasn't worked at all. It's [[00:31:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1900.8999999999999s)]
*  been counterproductive. And that's also true of neighboring countries, Iraq, Syria right now, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1904.74s)]
*  Libya. I mean, just name the country. Like, regime change is hard to pull off. Okay? So anyone telling [[00:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1910.6599999999999s)]
*  you regime change, and there are a lot of people, paid liars in Washington, who are telling you that, [[00:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1915.54s)]
*  like, oh, well, just regime change. So there's a huge, lots of people hate the religious authorities [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1921.54s)]
*  in Iran. I think that's true, seems to be true. But that's not the same as, oh, we're going to [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1925.7s)]
*  throw in a pro-Western government and everything's going to be fine. Like, show us where you've done [[00:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1930.26s)]
*  that before. Oh, you've never done it before. No, I've been joking that. And when they talk about [[00:32:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1934.02s)]
*  regime change in Russia, they think they're going to get Jeb Bartlett in there after Putin. Like, [[00:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1937.7s)]
*  hello. Oh, dude. Oh, dude. The largest country in the world is 25% Muslim. That, you know, Putin is [[00:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1942.02s)]
*  a moderate, Putin is the most pro-Western person I've dealt with in Russia. I mean, I'm just telling [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1950.02s)]
*  you, like, whatever, I'm not defending Putin. Though I think you can make a case he's done a great job [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1955.06s)]
*  for Russia. No, but you're making a case you don't know what's coming next. And yeah, look at the [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1959.06s)]
*  terrorism threat from within Russia. I mean, he's clamped down on that, just the way you'd want to [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1963.46s)]
*  happen in your country. I think we can say that anybody at a think tank or a publication [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1968.1799999999998s)]
*  or a federal agency who blithely talks about regime change in any country should be disqualified [[00:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1973.9399999999998s)]
*  from talking about anything foreign policy related ever again. If you had a hand in the Iraq War, [[00:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1979.78s)]
*  if you had a hand in the Syria disaster, if you had a hand in killing Qaddafi, if you had a hand [[00:33:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1984.6599999999999s)]
*  in Afghanistan, if you lied about what happened on 9-11, and that's pretty much everybody in DC and [[00:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1989.06s)]
*  the foreign policy establishment, you can no longer participate in the decision making process [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1993.94s)]
*  about where to send arms and money around the world because you are disqualified. Your track [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=1998.98s)]
*  record is so repugnant. We're not going to throw you in jail, though you clearly deserve it. We are [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2003.7s)]
*  instead just going to take you out of the conversation because you were demonstrably unqualified [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2008.1000000000001s)]
*  to get us into new wars because you screwed it up last time. I don't think that's a terrible [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2012.74s)]
*  standard. That's like a really straightforward standard. And I feel angry about it because I [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2016.8200000000002s)]
*  spent my whole life there. My dad worked for the federal government in the foreign policy sphere. [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2020.66s)]
*  And so, like, I just grew up with this stuff and I know the people. And I know that none of them has [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2024.9s)]
*  ever apologized or changed his thinking, repented. And the baseline requirement in my house as a [[00:33:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2031.38s)]
*  father is you can do whatever you want. You can screw up as badly as you want. I will always love [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2037.78s)]
*  you no matter what you do. But you have to admit fault and you have to try to change. That's called [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2041.8600000000001s)]
*  repentance. That's like we should make that an absolute unyielding requirement for our leaders. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2047.14s)]
*  If you screw up, if you admit it and try to get better, we still love you. But if you refuse to [[00:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2053.2200000000003s)]
*  do that, we're never trusting you again. And that's our entire foreign policy establishment. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2058.1s)]
*  And so for those people, and by the way, it's not just that they're like arguing for regime [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2061.62s)]
*  change in Iraq. They're not. They're not. They don't, they're not even honorable enough to say [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2066.02s)]
*  what they want out loud. And anyone who raises questions, I'll speak from great experience on [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2070.42s)]
*  this topic. I've never said word one about what's happening in Gaza. Okay. I have views on it. I'm [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2076.02s)]
*  not impressed at all. But I've like tried to pull back because it's not my country. Okay. So I'm just [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2082.42s)]
*  looking at it from an American perspective. I don't want my country to be further weakened, [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2087.7s)]
*  my fellow citizens to die yet again, my federal treasury to be drained yet again on behalf of an [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2093.78s)]
*  idea that's clearly stupid. Like I think it's important to say, wait a second, is this a good [[00:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2101.06s)]
*  idea? Can we actually do what you say we can do? For doing that, I have been attacked as a tool of [[00:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2105.38s)]
*  Iran. I'm a freaking Episcopalian. I am not Shiite as a tool of Qatar. It was like one of our closest [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2112.26s)]
*  allies in the world. The largest American air base in the Middle East is in Qatar. They're a close [[00:35:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2118.26s)]
*  ally of ours. And all of a sudden it's like, oh, you're taking Qatari money. I've never taken a [[00:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2123.1400000000003s)]
*  dollar. I've never taken a dollar from any government. I mean, are you joking? And these [[00:35:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2127.7000000000003s)]
*  are people who are acting on behalf of a foreign government telling me that I'm unpatriotic. And I [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2132.02s)]
*  try not to get like crazy angry about it, but it's hard because you see these people, you know, [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2136.98s)]
*  Ben Shapiro or these shills like come out and like attack you personally because having- [[00:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2143.78s)]
*  He was bashing you just this week. [[00:35:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2149.54s)]
*  But it's what's so infuriating is like I'm 56 in two weeks. So I've watched this. I was in Iraq. [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2151.86s)]
*  Like I'm not an expert on anything and I would never claim expertise. I try not to claim expertise [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2158.02s)]
*  I don't have, but just I have a good memory and I was there for a lot of this stuff. And I have [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2161.86s)]
*  unresolved rage for the reasons I just explained. No one's apologized. No one's repented. No one's [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2166.9s)]
*  changed. And so to attack me is I'm selling out my country, which is the only thing I care about. [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2171.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't have another passport. I have no plans to go anywhere. I could. I could certainly afford to [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2177.38s)]
*  move some other country. I'm not. I live directly across from my parents' grave and I'm never [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2181.38s)]
*  leaving. So to attack me as a shill for another country, when you yourself are shilling for another [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2185.7000000000003s)]
*  country, it's almost too much for my tiny brain to deal with actually. How much better it would be [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2191.3s)]
*  if someone like Ben Shapiro who's smart and I don't think Ben Shapiro is like evil. I'm not attacking [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2197.94s)]
*  him as a person, but how much better would it be if he could just sit and say, okay, here's what I [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2202.26s)]
*  think would happen if we joined an attack on Iran or stop lying to me and telling me that we're [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2207.2200000000003s)]
*  going to defeat the Houthis. The whole point of getting involved in a war with the Houthis is to [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2213.38s)]
*  suck us into a war with Iran. I know that because I know a lot about this topic. So don't [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2218.26s)]
*  patronize me and lie to me. Just be straightforward and say, I think we can affect regime change in [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2223.94s)]
*  Iran. Here's how we can do it. And then I could say, well, here are my concerns. But instead it's [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2229.6200000000003s)]
*  like, oh, you're weak. You don't love America. I don't love America. Really? It's too much. I [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2233.6200000000003s)]
*  can't deal with it. Obviously. My goat has been gone. [[00:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2242.0200000000004s)]
*  I can't remember exactly what he was saying, but he was definitely suggesting that you were, [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2244.74s)]
*  I can't remember. I just saw it in passing in the headlines. So I don't want to say it was [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2249.62s)]
*  something about the Russia. I'm a peacenik. [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2252.66s)]
*  Well, I mean, what's wrong with being a peacenik? Frankly, I mean, I'm not great. It's kind of the [[00:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2255.06s)]
*  time for peaceniks after 20 years of endless war and a lot of blood and treasure sacrifice for [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2260.9799999999996s)]
*  very little results. Well, I kind of feel that way. And I it's hard for me as someone who's [[00:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2265.2999999999997s)]
*  carried a 38 in his pocket for many years to think of myself as like some hippie peacenik or [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2270.42s)]
*  something. But I do think that Christianity, unique among the world's religions, certainly [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2275.06s)]
*  among the monotheistic religions, has a real problem with violence. Like I just have been [[00:38:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2280.5s)]
*  reading the New Testament. I'm hardly a theologian. I'm not an expert. Consult other sources. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2285.7000000000003s)]
*  Don't take my word for it. But like, it's pretty clear in the Gospels that when Peter pulls out [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2290.58s)]
*  the sword and cuts off the ear of the guy who's arresting Jesus and Jesus scolds him and heals [[00:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2295.46s)]
*  the slaves here, it's like that's a pretty clear sign that our religion does not condone violence. [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2300.34s)]
*  And I don't understand why nobody says that. But that is my read of it. So I do feel like there's a [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2306.1800000000003s)]
*  religious impulse behind my views also, but there's a the practical concerns that I just [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2312.82s)]
*  listed. But on the Russia thing, it's like, nobody asked me whether I thought Russia should be our [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2317.46s)]
*  enemy. I'll tell you, no, I think people are really mad that they were not mad at Russia before. [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2323.1400000000003s)]
*  They were not mad when the Soviets ran it. They weren't mad when the drunk Boris Yeltsin ran it. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2328.58s)]
*  They were mad when Putin took over in 2000 and started refinancing the Russian Orthodox Church. [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2332.2599999999998s)]
*  I do think that was like a really that was upsetting to a lot of people in the West. [[00:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2337.94s)]
*  And I think whatever that's their view. That's not my view. I think that's good. I think Christian [[00:39:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2342.34s)]
*  countries are good. And I think that, you know, I'm not moving to Russia. I don't speak Russian. [[00:39:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2347.22s)]
*  I have kind of nothing to do with Russia, actually. But I definitely don't think it's the most [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2353.14s)]
*  threatening country in the world to us. I think we should be allies with Russia. I think that's in [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2357.3s)]
*  our interest. So to to say like, oh, you like Putin. Well, okay, first of all, I'm an American [[00:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2360.6600000000003s)]
*  citizen. I can like anyone I want. Okay, it's not doesn't mean I'm unpatriotic. Actually, I would [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2366.5800000000004s)]
*  have questions about the patriotism of anybody who wants to get us into a war that's going to [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2372.34s)]
*  kill more Americans that we can't win. And that serves no obvious purpose. So like, the whole way [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2376.02s)]
*  of debating it drives me bonkers. It's like personal. It's attacking people's character. [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2380.6600000000003s)]
*  It's attacking their loyalty to the nation. I thought that's what the left did. And it's also, [[00:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2386.18s)]
*  by the way, in favor of censorship, like, oh, I don't know if you should platform people with [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2390.3399999999997s)]
*  those views. What that's ridiculous. But that's another thing that's annoying. The word platform [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2394.5s)]
*  is not a verb. It's not a verb. It's a noun. It's something you stand on when you dive into a swimming [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2399.06s)]
*  pool. It's not a verb. Stop stealing my nouns and making them into verbs. You douchebag. Yes, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2403.7s)]
*  it stops stealing pronouns that already have a meaning and trying to give them new meaning. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2410.66s)]
*  They then mistakenly, it's not available to you confuse people. [[00:40:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2415.14s)]
*  Sorry. Wow. No, it's good. It's fine. I got a lot of places I could go with that. [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2419.7799999999997s)]
*  But what you said is also true about what's happening in Gaza. You know, I've been very [[00:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2427.14s)]
*  pro-Israel on this show after the 10-7 attack, and then I haven't been following the day to day, [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2431.3799999999997s)]
*  you know, bombing campaign. But I have noticed and I've talked to Glenn Greenwald on the program [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2435.94s)]
*  about it a lot that, you know, the people who have problems with what Israel is doing [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2440.9s)]
*  too often get the knee jerk. You're an anti-Semite and that's not okay either. You know, it's like [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2446.98s)]
*  it is totally fine to criticize Israel and to think that they've gone too far and that they've [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2452.58s)]
*  been too, you know, non-judicious in this retaliatory campaign. That is you cannot dismiss [[00:40:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2457.06s)]
*  anybody who feels that way and who is really critical of how Israel's handled itself [[00:41:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2462.9s)]
*  as an anti-Semite. But that gets, you know, that gets collapsed too into like one of those narratives [[00:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2466.9s)]
*  one cannot espouse. You are not allowed to say that just like you are not allowed to [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2471.62s)]
*  have a different view of Putin and this war, you know, this proxy war that we've entered to against [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2475.46s)]
*  him. See, it's actually, it's a very powerful slur. It has a much more immediate effect on my life [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2480.26s)]
*  that, you know, they called me for years a racist or whatever. Okay. You know, if I was racist, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2489.62s)]
*  literally all over the New York Times. They're so disappointed they couldn't bring you down. [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2494.2599999999998s)]
*  I didn't really care. You know, I have a lot of Jewish friends, like real friends, not people I [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2499.7s)]
*  know, but like actual friends. And so I don't want to be called that because it's not true. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2504.66s)]
*  And that's a very tough thing to call somebody. And all of a sudden, I, you know, the last thing [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2510.58s)]
*  I want is a fight over Israel. I just don't, by the way, I do think way too much head space in this [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2517.06s)]
*  country and too much public debate is devoted to foreign countries. Like I want to know how we're [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2522.9s)]
*  going to fix the roads in this country and lower the suicide rate a little bit in the OD rate. I [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2527.06s)]
*  think you should be worried about the Mexican drug cartels. Just quickly, there are a lot of things [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2531.62s)]
*  we're not talking about. In our last half hour today, we're going to be talking about the fentanyl [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2534.6600000000003s)]
*  crisis because it's the National Fentanyl Awareness Day. And it's the number one killer of our young [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2539.54s)]
*  people. The number one killer of our young people. It's killed more people than all the wars since [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2543.62s)]
*  World War II forward has killed in America. And we're just kind of like, I mean, until Trump, [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2548.98s)]
*  really, we weren't paying much attention to it at all. Yeah. I mean, and I think all of us, [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2553.78s)]
*  I know a couple of people who've died from it and I'm not unusual. I think everyone knows people who [[00:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2558.58s)]
*  died from it. So it's literally like the worst thing that's happening in the United States. And [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2563.14s)]
*  you know, fentanyl has killed more Americans than Iran has. So on some level, it's like, [[00:42:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2569.06s)]
*  I resent the hijacking of my concern by a foreign country. I mean, I do. And I think, look, I've [[00:42:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2573.06s)]
*  spent a lot of time in foreign countries. I think foreign policy is super interesting. It [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2578.66s)]
*  matters to the United States. The world matters. I mean, I'm not an isolationist in any sense. I'm [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2581.46s)]
*  actually in more foreign countries than most people by a lot, you know, but I do think fixing [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2586.2599999999998s)]
*  the United States is the main priority for Americans. So that bothers me. But on the [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2591.7s)]
*  question of Israel, it's like, I like Israel. I've been there a number of times, taking my family [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2595.06s)]
*  there on vacation. They're going again soon. We're Christians. They want to go to Jerusalem. I got it. [[00:43:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2598.74s)]
*  And I have a million friends who both live in Israel and who love Israel. So I don't want to [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2604.5s)]
*  have a fight about Israel at all. Just at all. So I've really tried not to have that fight. [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2608.82s)]
*  But I don't want the United States to enter in another unwinnable Middle Eastern war. I just [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2614.98s)]
*  really, really don't. Especially now. We don't even have the ammo for it. So whatever. There's a lot. [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2620.34s)]
*  But anyway, I have been like attacked in ways that are so crazy that I've, and it's totally [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2624.02s)]
*  coordinated from Israel. So I finally, the other day, I called someone I know in the Israeli [[00:43:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2629.62s)]
*  government. There are like some great people in the Israeli government. I called one of them [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2635.7799999999997s)]
*  and I said, you know, stop this. Like, I am not your enemy. You have, you don't think you have [[00:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2639.38s)]
*  enough enemies? You have like real enemies. I've gone out of my way. And by the way, it's our weapons [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2643.54s)]
*  being used in Gaza. So I have every right to say you have a dispute with your neighbor and you want [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2650.58s)]
*  to get medieval on him, do it on your own dime. Do it with your own weapons. I'm not paying for [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2656.82s)]
*  that. That's a totally fair position as an American taxpayer who pays like way more than his share in [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2662.02s)]
*  taxes. Like I have a right to do that. I haven't done that because I don't want to fight. But I've [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2666.5s)]
*  been attacked anyway. And these creepy people taking direct orders from a foreign government [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2670.9s)]
*  are attacking me on the internet. And I wouldn't care except this specific slur affects my personal [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2676.02s)]
*  life. Like a really old friend of mine, 35 year old friend, I can't believe what they're saying. [[00:44:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2681.3s)]
*  Is this true? Is it true that I'm an anti-Semite? No. What are you even saying? So they've gotten to [[00:44:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2685.62s)]
*  me. So that's made me upset. So I called up and I was like, you guys got to stop. We're not doing [[00:44:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2693.62s)]
*  that. I'm almost 56. I know how the world works. Please stop. Well, and I was like, if you think [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2696.98s)]
*  I'm your main enemy in a world that really hates you, I mean, they're right about that. A lot of [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2705.54s)]
*  people really do hate Israel. I'm not one of them. If you think I'm the problem, you've gone off the [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2710.9s)]
*  deep end. You're insane. Like I am showing restraint. The only thing I've done one segment on [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2716.1s)]
*  the whole topic and it's on Christians in the Holy Land. I am a Christian. My family's been [[00:45:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2722.5s)]
*  Christian for, you know, whatever, a thousand years. I have a right to say this. And Christians [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2727.3s)]
*  in the Holy Land are mistreated by Muslims and by Israel and in the West Bank and in Gaza. And I [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2731.46s)]
*  have a right to say, I don't think that U.S. tax dollars should be used to mistreat Christians. [[00:45:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2740.58s)]
*  And by the way, my real contempt is not for Israel. It's for the American evangelical preachers who [[00:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2745.2999999999997s)]
*  ignore this, the Christian Zionists who think it's okay to blow up a church because they're [[00:45:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2750.5s)]
*  weird theology, which is like demonstrably not in the New Testament. I can just tell you it's not [[00:45:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2755.54s)]
*  there. I don't know where they came up with this. It's not there. It's not what it says, but whatever. [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2761.38s)]
*  I'm mad at them. I did one segment on that and all of a sudden I'm like a Holocaust denier or [[00:46:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2764.9s)]
*  something. So anyway, I called up and I said, you guys got to pull back on this stuff. It's crazy. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2770.9s)]
*  And again, I'm the wrong target and I don't think it really had any effect, but I did do that [[00:46:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2776.26s)]
*  because it's like, why would I want that? I just don't want to go with the wrong. [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2782.5s)]
*  How does it make its way to you, Tucker? Because I know you wisely avoid the internet as much as [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2786.98s)]
*  possible. Because people I know, I get texts from people who were like, oh, you know, is it, do you [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2792.5s)]
*  really have a Holocaust denier on your show? What? No. I was in a meeting. It comes to you personally. [[00:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2800.5s)]
*  Right. Okay. With a well-known person who's like, who I like, who's like, my wife wanted me to ask [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2806.9s)]
*  you, why did you have a Holocaust denier on your show? And I was like, I don't even know what the [[00:46:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2812.5s)]
*  hell he was talking about. And it's just layers of propaganda rather than look, and I'm not, I hate [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2816.26s)]
*  when people whine about being attacked. I almost never do it. I'm just in this specific case, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2821.46s)]
*  I think we are being robbed of the debate that we need over our foreign policy, over foreign [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2827.94s)]
*  influence on our politics, which is absolutely profound. And it's not coming from Russia. It's [[00:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2836.7400000000002s)]
*  coming from Israel. It's profound. You can't even say that out loud because why? And I feel like [[00:47:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2840.5s)]
*  none of us can have an honest, non-hateful, non-crazy, non-antisemitic, just a straightforward [[00:47:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2846.98s)]
*  conversation about sovereignty, like can we make decisions that are in our interest or not, [[00:47:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2852.5s)]
*  and about what the wise course is. And by the way, I think you should listen to other countries, [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2857.94s)]
*  including Israel and Canada and France and every country. Like what you do has an effect on other [[00:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2862.6600000000003s)]
*  people and you should hear them out. I'm not saying you shouldn't, you should. And I would [[00:47:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2867.54s)]
*  include Israel in that. I'm merely saying we should talk openly and not leave it to the crazy [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2871.46s)]
*  people. Responsible, normal, non-hateful people should have an open conversation about what the [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2878.7400000000002s)]
*  right next steps are in all kinds of different theaters and the risks. That's exactly right. [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2886.18s)]
*  And you can't because all of a sudden you've got Ben Shapiro being like, oh, you're sucking up to [[00:48:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2891.46s)]
*  Putin. You're antisemitic. It's like, son, sit this one out. You have no idea what you're talking [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2895.54s)]
*  about. You're a child actually. And you're reading talking points that discredit you. I think Ben is [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2900.66s)]
*  smart. He probably has interesting things to say. But when you are unwilling to criticize a foreign [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2906.5s)]
*  government at all, it tells the rest of us what you're saying isn't real. Like will you criticize [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2911.54s)]
*  the US government every day? Are you kidding? My dad worked for the US government and I'm willing [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2917.62s)]
*  to criticize every, that's all I do is criticize the US government. You're not going to criticize [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2922.18s)]
*  a foreign government? What are you talking about? Who wrote these rules, man? And you're going to try [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2926.18s)]
*  and shut me up by calling me a hater when I'm not. And if I were, I would just say so. I don't think [[00:48:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2931.2999999999997s)]
*  that's going to work. Yeah. No, it didn't work when the New York Times tried to do it to you on the [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2936.2599999999998s)]
*  racist claim or to me for that matter. And it can't work on an antisemitism charge either. Like we [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2940.5s)]
*  have to, we have to be able to talk about Israel and Iran. Very honestly, the ups and downs and the [[00:49:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2945.3799999999997s)]
*  severe risks of this strategy that many are pushing. Though the question is whether Trump [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2951.94s)]
*  is listening. All right. We've got to squeeze in a break. The one and only Tucker Carlson. He's so [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2956.66s)]
*  interesting, isn't he? I haven't even scratched the surface of my list. So we'll come back and [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2960.5s)]
*  we'll scratch some surfaces. Don't go anywhere. These days, it feels like nothing surprises us [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2963.94s)]
*  anymore, right? But not necessarily in a good way. The headlines are heavy. The future feels uncertain [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2972.1s)]
*  and so much is out of our control. But one thing you can take control of right now is your family's [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=2977.54s)]

*  call a ride. It's not a ride. It's a mission. There's nothing frivolous about what we just did. [[00:51:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3079.2200000000003s)]
*  Blonde origin. [[00:51:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3085.06s)]
*  Where weightlessness and cluelessness collide. [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3087.7799999999997s)]
*  That is so awesome. You're going to the Middle East and I'm going to space. [[00:51:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3097.62s)]
*  No, I just love that. I can't see any video. So I'm just hearing it. Like, what's this? [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3104.2599999999998s)]
*  That's awesome. We got to tune in on Friday when we have our official response to the [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3111.94s)]
*  ridiculousness of that blue origin space flight where we crowned six new astronauts. You may have [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3117.7s)]
*  heard that they have difficult time calling themselves astronauts because they're not. [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3124.18s)]
*  But we had so much fun mocking them. And let's just say we took it to new heights, the mockery. [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3129.78s)]
*  It's not a ride. It's a mission. So good. [[00:52:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3137.2200000000003s)]
*  Good. Okay. I want to start with this. Mark Halpern was on the show recently and he had [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3139.62s)]
*  something interesting to say about you and it had the ring of truth. I know he's been on your show [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3146.98s)]
*  too. Take a listen to what he reported here on the show. Do you think Pete Hegseth will survive [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3152.66s)]
*  this and will he survive as defense secretary? Because it's very clear some group of people [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3160.1s)]
*  that's pretty loud is out to get him. Yeah. So I've got what I call the Trump board of directors. [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3168.5s)]
*  Okay. And the board of directors is Tucker, Charlie Kirk, and Don Jr. And if the board of [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3176.18s)]
*  directors support something, I think generally it happens. And I believe all three of them, [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3182.9s)]
*  I know all three of them have been supportive. Confirm or deny? [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3188.58s)]
*  Well, no one tells me when the meetings are. No, of course not. I'm not on the board of directors. [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3194.1s)]
*  No, I... You know, it means informally that you're like the top advisors on the outside. [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3202.9s)]
*  No, my gosh. I don't like it when people exert influence secretly. It's better just to say out [[00:53:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3207.62s)]
*  loud exactly. Because what happened, and I've seen it obviously my whole life, is that people become [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3214.18s)]
*  power worshipers really quickly. It's in all of us to kowtow to power, to worship power, to want power, [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3219.86s)]
*  and that's our destruction. So I'm wary of all of that. I mean, I love Trump. I've always, [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3225.7000000000003s)]
*  you know, I mean, I've definitely gone through phases over the last 20 plus years of knowing Trump. [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3231.86s)]
*  But no, I, you know, there's no one who's more entertaining, fun to be with, whose instincts are, [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3238.1000000000004s)]
*  they're just incredible. He's like, he's an incredible person. You don't, obviously, [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3243.86s)]
*  he's an incredible person. So I really like Trump so much. And, but I try and say, I try to, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3247.54s)]
*  probably don't always succeed, but I try to say exactly what I would say in private, in public. [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3252.82s)]
*  I just try to be transparent, both so I don't have to keep track of different storylines or lies, [[00:54:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3257.7s)]
*  and also because I just feel better. It's just good to be open about everything. I do think Pete is [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3262.42s)]
*  under attack. I love Halperin, by the way. He's really smart. Yeah, I know. He's launching his [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3267.94s)]
*  own podcast today. It's called Up Next with Mark Halperin. And that's part of our new MK Media [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3273.14s)]
*  podcast network. Sorry, next up, next up. I love that. Oh, I didn't even know. I'm going to text [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3279.94s)]
*  him right now. He's, but anyway, I think his analysis is totally right. There is a group, [[00:54:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3284.66s)]
*  I think it's partly ideological, that would very much like to see Pete out. I'm on this, you know, [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3288.42s)]
*  I'm of course, close to Pete, known Pete a long time, we have the same job. I know you are as well. [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3293.7799999999997s)]
*  And so I'm strongly for Pete. But I do think that a lot of the drama at the staff level in the [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3298.74s)]
*  Pentagon, some of it's just the product of the fact the Pentagon is a snake pit, very complicated [[00:55:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3304.98s)]
*  place to work. I said to Pete recently, I was like, there's no way I could ever, I couldn't run that [[00:55:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3309.62s)]
*  place for one day. I mean, I'm just, I'm in awe of anyone who can run the Pentagon. So I think that's [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3314.74s)]
*  part of it. But there's also an ideological motive here. And Pete is like sensible, he's rooted in [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3319.38s)]
*  the experience of the troops. He is of course, loyal to the president, he understands the [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3325.7s)]
*  president's vision. And it would be a lot easier, I think, to have like a crazed neoconservative [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3330.02s)]
*  senator run the Pentagon, if you wanted to work with Iran, I do think that's part of it. And [[00:55:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3336.66s)]
*  so I don't understand a lot of what's happening there. I do know Dan Caldwell, [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3343.54s)]
*  pretty well. Who's one of the, the aides, senior aides who was fired. Yeah. And I'm completely [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3347.22s)]
*  convinced, I think the evidence proves that Dan Caldwell did not leak classified information to [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3354.82s)]
*  NBC News. That's a lie. I was told that by somebody who I trust, by the way, who I think was telling [[00:56:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3360.02s)]
*  me the truth. He believed it also. But that was out there. Everyone heard that he photocopied [[00:56:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3364.5800000000004s)]
*  information or took a picture on his phone, texted it to this reporter at NBC, broke federal law. [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3369.94s)]
*  That's a crime to do that. undermine the president, etc, etc. Well, that was that that's not true. He [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3375.06s)]
*  didn't do that. And moreover, not only did he not do that, there's no evidence that he did it because [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3379.86s)]
*  they never took his phone and they never polygraphed him. So the whole thing was one of [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3384.02s)]
*  those classic Washington, I think of it as like getting attacked by a swarm of bees. Like you're [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3387.78s)]
*  just going along, you're walking through the woods, and all of a sudden you step on a hive, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3393.06s)]
*  and they're just flying up your shorts, they're on you, you can't think straight, all you know is pain. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3396.42s)]
*  And that's how they get people like this stuff will appear out of nowhere. All of a sudden, [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3400.82s)]
*  you'll just hear so and so is bad. He did something really wrong. I don't know all the details, but [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3405.06s)]
*  he's he's done. And and then the the five minute hate begins in the person's destroyed. That's what [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3408.58s)]
*  happened to Dan Caldwell. And the question is, why wasn't personal, because Dan Caldwell was a check [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3413.54s)]
*  against the enormous pressure that the Pentagon and the White House are receiving to engage in [[00:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3420.42s)]
*  a war with Iran. And also to destabilize Pete. I mean, he'd worked with Pete for over 10 years, [[00:57:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3426.82s)]
*  they were concerned veterans for America together. So he knew him well. And so to take away all the [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3432.2599999999998s)]
*  people that the secretary knows well and trusts and replace them with, you know, sinister lifers, [[00:57:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3437.94s)]
*  who are never telling the truth about anything, I do think, again, I don't have any special [[00:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3445.86s)]
*  knowledge. This is just my outside analysis as someone who's a student of bureaucracy, [[00:57:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3449.54s)]
*  the federal bureaucracy. I think that's what happened. So after you guys, after you sat with [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3453.7000000000003s)]
*  Dan Caldwell, which was a great interview and I hit last Monday, everybody should listen to it. [[00:57:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3459.14s)]
*  We wound up speaking with one of the other guys who got fired, Colin Carroll. [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3462.82s)]
*  And he had a different take on it. His take was, I mean, he didn't put it in this exact way, but he [[00:57:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3468.02s)]
*  said, they're having these fights with this Joe Casper, who's Pete's chief of staff. They couldn't [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3473.54s)]
*  get along with this guy. He couldn't get along with them, like pretty much all three of them. [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3479.14s)]
*  It sounded like maybe he felt threatened by them. He denies that he says the office was running fine. [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3482.7400000000002s)]
*  Just look at the results. But they seem to say this guy was an obstacle that they were trying [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3487.06s)]
*  to get around. And I think they think he was out to get them. And he thinks they were out to get [[00:58:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3491.06s)]
*  him. And they think he had a heavy hand in setting it up to look like they were the leakers. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3497.46s)]
*  And I don't know exactly whether that's true or not, but obviously those three were walked [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3504.26s)]
*  out the door and he was walked out of his position. He's no longer the chief of staff, [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3508.02s)]
*  but the whole thing has the unfortunate effect of making Pete's top inner circle look like it's in [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3512.5s)]
*  disarray. And I'll say this, we both like Mark a lot. So his podcast is called Next Up. It's going [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3518.02s)]
*  to premiere today. And he, I believe, has a bit of news. He's going to be breaking on Pete. [[00:58:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3523.22s)]
*  And it doesn't sound like it's necessarily going to be all that positive. So we'll have to tune in. [[00:58:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3530.1s)]
*  Even I don't know exactly what it is. So we'll have to tune in to find out. But I'll ask you the same [[00:58:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3534.8199999999997s)]
*  question I was asking there. Do you think he will survive this? Because there are a lot of people [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3539.7s)]
*  out to get him. And you don't know, right? So far outwardly, Trump has been saying he stands by him, [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3545.7799999999997s)]
*  but you just never know how much of this he wants to wade through. [[00:59:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3550.9s)]
*  Well, of course, I have no idea what Halpern's going to say. And he's been, as he does, actively [[00:59:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3556.26s)]
*  reporting on this. I have not been. So I'm sure he knows a lot more than I do. So I don't want to [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3561.38s)]
*  get over my skis and make yet another bad prediction, which I've done for 30 years. [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3566.9s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3571.94s)]
*  Well, Putin will never invade Ukraine. Okay. That was one of my bad predictions. But [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3572.58s)]
*  excuse me. But my sense, as of last time I was paying close attention talking to people, is that [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3578.58s)]
*  Pete, Secretary Hegseth did have the full support of the president. And both because I think he [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3587.14s)]
*  loves Pete as a person. I know I do. I'm just a good guy. And his wife was my producer, who I love, [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3593.94s)]
*  Jen. And so I think Trump feels the same way about them. Pete has a lot of friends. People [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3600.18s)]
*  like Pete. He's a good man. But also because I don't think you want to lose a key cabinet [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3604.8999999999996s)]
*  secretary 100 days in. I don't think that's a good precedent at all. [[01:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3611.14s)]
*  And for what? [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3614.5s)]
*  I am... And for what? [[01:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3615.14s)]
*  You know, it's like... [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3616.8199999999997s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3617.46s)]
*  For what? Because there were staff squabbles? [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3618.1s)]
*  Yes, exactly. No, I think that's exactly right. And I don't know Colin. I've heard he's amazing. [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3621.22s)]
*  And a patriot and a man of bravery and integrity. And I believe all of that. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3630.66s)]
*  And I'm sure that staff squabbles and fights with the Chief of Staff, Joe Casper, [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3634.8199999999997s)]
*  played a huge role in all of this. But my specialty is on the bigger questions, [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3639.2999999999997s)]
*  the ideological questions. And I just can't confirm, since that's the world that I live in, [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3644.18s)]
*  that there is huge pressure on a bunch of cabinet secretaries, particularly on Pete Hegseth, [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3648.5s)]
*  to go along with this war with Iran. That is priority one right now for a bunch of different [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3655.14s)]
*  reasons, partly because of where American troops are on rotation in the Middle East. [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3660.02s)]
*  There happen to be a lot of them right now, partly because there's a belief that Iran's [[01:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3664.66s)]
*  air defenses have been neutralized to some extent, and maybe for other reasons. [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3668.2599999999998s)]
*  So there's a lot of pressure right now. And so that is a factor in every big decision that's made. [[01:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3672.66s)]
*  You know? And I would just say that's a shame, because we have a lot of... [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3680.2599999999998s)]
*  I mean, those are all fair questions. Should we bomb Iran? Like, that's a real conversation. [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3683.86s)]
*  We should not ignore the conversation. [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3687.22s)]
*  But as you just said earlier about fentanyl, this country has a lot of problems. And Donald [[01:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3688.66s)]
*  Trump was elected by grateful voters who wanted those questions to be addressed. And so I just [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3693.62s)]
*  hope as we debate problems in other countries, we also reserve time to fix our own. [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3699.3799999999997s)]
*  Well, on that front, as we hit the 100-day mark, it's incredible what Trump has done at the border. [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3706.18s)]
*  And I don't think anybody's complaining about what he's done at the border. Even the Democrats [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3710.98s)]
*  aren't really saying anything negative about what he's done at the border. They're focused [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3714.5s)]
*  on the deportations, which is equally as important. I mean, we've got at least 10 million [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3717.62s)]
*  illegals to get out of this country. And we are being stymied at every turn by a media and the [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3723.7799999999997s)]
*  left who are hand in hand determined to stop it, even with the so-called worst first policy that [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3730.1s)]
*  Tom Homan is pursuing under Trump. We're going to start with not just those who are here illegally, [[01:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3735.94s)]
*  but those who have committed additional crimes or gang members, et cetera. And you've seen what the [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3740.18s)]
*  media has been doing to Trump on that front. It's been ridiculous. But I wonder what your [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3743.94s)]
*  thought is as Trump battles all this, because we saw the first potential drop in polling this week [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3748.66s)]
*  for Trump, even on immigration. That New York Times poll showed for the first time he was [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3755.54s)]
*  underwater on his support for his immigration policies. And overall, he's getting polled. [[01:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3761.46s)]
*  Like today, there was one that just dropped from NPR slash PBS slash Marist, [[01:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3766.7400000000002s)]
*  1400 and change people. Overall, they give him a grade. The majority said a D or an F, [[01:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3771.62s)]
*  52% said he gets a D or an F, 23% gave him an A, 17% gave him a B, 8% gave him a C. But the way [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3779.3799999999997s)]
*  this shakes out Tucker is 80% of Democrats gave him an F, 89% D or F. Republicans, 83% gave him an [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3785.8599999999997s)]
*  A or a B. And it was really the independents that drove the poll toward the negative for Trump. [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3793.62s)]
*  And really, the reason that happened is because 35% he gets an A or a B, and 55% said he gets a D [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3799.22s)]
*  or an F. So you got a 20 percentage point difference in the independence on whether he's [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3804.8999999999996s)]
*  doing a good job or a bad job. If you look at the number of people polled 1400 and change again, [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3808.8999999999996s)]
*  that's about 450 independents. So call it like 85 independents are in that swing. You've got 85 [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3813.2999999999997s)]
*  people polled who are independent, which swung this number, you know, sort of dramatically. [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3820.5s)]
*  Now all the press will run with, oh my God, he's being rejected by everybody. Look at these terrible [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3825.3799999999997s)]
*  numbers. He's a D or he's an F. And they will certainly try to say it's these deportations. [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3828.66s)]
*  And they will also say it's tariffs. So your thoughts on all that? [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3833.06s)]
*  I think tariffs are a completely separate category where I'll just say I'm hoping for the best, [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3837.54s)]
*  but uncertain as to how this is going to play out. And I'm not qualified even really to guess. But [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3843.62s)]
*  of course, same thank you for your honest station. And I'm rooting rooting for the oh, yeah, well, I [[01:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3848.42s)]
*  don't I don't want to, I don't want to be clown myself by talking about things I don't understand. [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3852.3399999999997s)]
*  Right. It's just that's not my area. So but but immigration, you know, I feel like I know more [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3857.54s)]
*  about him from a state that was destroyed by it completely. Gavin Newsom didn't destroy California [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3862.9s)]
*  mass immigration destroyed California. It's a completely different population than the one I [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3867.14s)]
*  grew up with. And it's not better. It's much worse. So that's the story around the world. It's the [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3870.74s)]
*  story of Sweden, where my ancestors came from. It's the story of Great Britain, where my other [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3875.06s)]
*  ancestors came from. It's a story of all Western Europe, France, Spain, these countries have been [[01:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3879.06s)]
*  destroyed by mass immigration. That's not a guess at this point, like the results are in we know. [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3883.7s)]
*  And so from my perspective, the real number in the United States is unknown. I spoke to a federal [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3889.46s)]
*  official recently who told me that real numbers probably closer to 50 million illegal aliens [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3895.22s)]
*  living in the United States right now. So my that leaves me confused. So you are watching in real [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3900.02s)]
*  time a digital prison being built around the rest of us on the basis of facial recognition and quote [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3905.9399999999996s)]
*  real IDs, where you can't conduct any business, you can't travel without verifying you are who [[01:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3911.62s)]
*  you say you are. Okay, that's the point of this. It's for our safety. But somehow we can't even know [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3916.58s)]
*  who lives in this country with facial recognition and real IDs. The federal government intrudes into [[01:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3921.94s)]
*  every decision you make in your personal life. But somehow they're totally incapable with all [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3927.54s)]
*  of that technology of telling us how many non citizens are living here illegally. I call [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3932.3399999999997s)]
*  bullshit on that. That's a lie. And I also wonder like, what is the the abs the aggregate number of [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3938.02s)]
*  deportees in the last 100 days, if it's under a million, I'll just say I'm disappointed. And I say [[01:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3944.98s)]
*  this is someone voted for Trump who loves Trump. I like Tom Homan. But like, what is this? The scale [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3949.78s)]
*  of this, because this country is so large, is opaque to most people, they don't understand that [[01:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3955.06s)]
*  our country was just completely changed forever. And it's not acceptable. I mean, I happen to live [[01:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3960.34s)]
*  in a place that's really been affected by immigration by refugee resettlement, which is, [[01:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3965.46s)]
*  I think, a worse problem than illegal immigration, by the way, because at least illegal immigrants [[01:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3970.34s)]
*  are showing a willingness to put their own butt on the line to get a better life. There's something [[01:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3974.58s)]
*  about that that everybody admires. I don't admire anything about a church group, Catholic charities, [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3980.66s)]
*  or the million Protestant groups that move refugees from some refugee camp in Africa into my community, [[01:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3986.58s)]
*  where they languish, commit welfare fraud, commit crime. I'm not even attacking them. Like, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3993.78s)]
*  I feel sorry for them, too. You know, you were just living in Sudan or Somalia, and now you're [[01:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=3997.78s)]
*  living in Minneapolis or Portland, Maine. It's like, I feel sorry for you. No one really cares [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4002.34s)]
*  about the effect on you or your family, obviously. But the net effect on the people who live there [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4007.6200000000003s)]
*  is terrible. I can verify that. And no one even mentions it. It's like truly destroying the United [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4012.02s)]
*  States is the largest crime ever committed against us. I am not a racist. I'm not even insecure [[01:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4018.1000000000004s)]
*  about it anymore since I've been called it so much. It's not in my heart. I'm not a racist. [[01:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4023.46s)]
*  I am a nationalist who loves this country and has no other. And that is a true, true [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4027.78s)]
*  attack on the United States. And I think we need more resources, more seriousness, [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4034.9s)]
*  and higher numbers. Like, get back to me when you report 5 million people. [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4040.58s)]
*  This just hit. As we were speaking, Bill Mollugin of Fox News knew. ICE announces they've deported [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4044.42s)]
*  65,682 illegals in the Trump administration's first 100 days and have arrested 66,000 and change [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4052.02s)]
*  illegals, 75% of whom have criminal charges or convictions. So that's, we've arrested about 66,000 [[01:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4060.74s)]
*  and we've deported 66,000. So that's a best case scenario of getting rid of or getting custody over [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4069.7s)]
*  about 120,000, Tucker. And that's not great. It's not great. They've been stymied at every turn. [[01:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4076.02s)]
*  The local officials haven't allowed it. The courts, the ACLU. But I mean, how, [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4083.14s)]
*  and I have to say even this, like, we're waiting on our big, beautiful bill. [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4087.94s)]
*  So President Trump can get funding for his initiatives. Tom Homan's been jumping up and [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4091.78s)]
*  down saying, I have no place to put the people. Like, you know, they do have some certain time [[01:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4096.02s)]
*  where we have to lock them up before we can ship them out while they get their, quote, due process. [[01:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4100.34s)]
*  He's like, I'm running out of beds. Like, I need, I need help. That's what he's been saying. But [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4104.1s)]
*  what do you think of that? Because that's why is it on incumbent on us? First of all, stop [[01:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4107.700000000001s)]
*  refugee resettlement in the United States. It's destroyed a lot of communities. It's destroyed [[01:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4111.9400000000005s)]
*  communities that I'm very familiar with, destroyed them forever. So stop that immediately. We have [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4116.820000000001s)]
*  no moral obligation to take a single new refugee and we shouldn't period. Second, Mexico, one word, [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4121.54s)]
*  Mexico, Mexico, a country that exists because of our largesse, because we move so much manufacturing [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4128.42s)]
*  in Mexico. I mean, you know, Monterey, Mexico, which is the economic engine, Mexico, wouldn't [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4133.14s)]
*  wouldn't be so if it weren't for the United States. And so we have a lot of leverage over Mexico, [[01:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4137.700000000001s)]
*  by the way, they're, you know, they're sending us drugs, we're sending them jobs, and they're also [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4142.740000000001s)]
*  sending us refugees and illegal immigrants from all over the world. How about we just move a million [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4146.820000000001s)]
*  people to Tijuana tomorrow and say, you deal with it, you did this to us, you deal with it. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4152.1s)]
*  And it was intentional. The anti-American sentiment, not among ordinary Mexicans who are [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4156.660000000001s)]
*  honestly some of my favorite people, I grew up next to them, awesome people, but their leaders [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4161.38s)]
*  hate the United States. They always have since the Mexican Revolution. That's why Leon Trotsky [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4165.86s)]
*  sought refuge in Mexico. There's a reason because the leadership of Mexico is extremely [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4169.9400000000005s)]
*  anti-American, extremely ideologically left wing, full atheist, by the way, in a Catholic country. [[01:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4176.26s)]
*  It's a super dark management structure in Mexico and always has been, honestly, since the heads [[01:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4182.34s)]
*  and they have no choice. They're the country that we should be applying pressure to. [[01:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4188.0199999999995s)]
*  Here are our legal aliens that walked across your sovereign territory to get into our country. [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4195.139999999999s)]
*  You deal with them and you cut the deal with Guatemala and you cut the deal with Honduras [[01:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4200.66s)]
*  or Peru. What do you make of all the due process? We haven't given due process before. [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4205.0599999999995s)]
*  You know, this is the United States. We have to give due process before we kick them out. [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4209.3s)]
*  I'm for due process and I am for due process specifically for me. I'm an American citizen. [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4213.06s)]
*  American citizens pay for the system, their ancestors built the system, and they deserve [[01:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4220.5s)]
*  its fruits. The first among them is fairness and due process. They're basically the same thing. [[01:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4225.22s)]
*  I'm not that concerned whether someone who broke a law, my law, to get into my country and is taking [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4231.22s)]
*  welfare from my pocket gets due process. I'm not that concerned. Second, after three years of getting [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4236.26s)]
*  a daily lecture about democracy and how it dies in darkness, democracy, democracy, what is democracy? [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4242.26s)]
*  Democracy is the idea that the people in a country run the country. They make the big decisions. They [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4246.34s)]
*  own it. They're not slaves or serfs. They're shareholders in this enterprise called America [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4250.02s)]
*  and they have a say. So now those same people are telling me that some appointed, unelected federal [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4254.42s)]
*  judge gets to invite seven billion people into my country and there's nothing I can do about it? [[01:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4259.3s)]
*  Yeah, I don't think so. I'm not playing along with that. I'm totally for balance of power. [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4265.46s)]
*  I'm for the current system as envisioned, which by the way is going away. It's not sustainable [[01:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4270.18s)]
*  with this population. Let's be honest. It's not, nobody cares about the constitution anymore. [[01:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4274.0199999999995s)]
*  I do because I'm a legacy American, but none of the newcomers, the 50 million people who just got [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4277.94s)]
*  here, they don't care at all. Why would they? It's not their heritage. It's mine. So you're going to [[01:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4282.58s)]
*  lecture me about that and then tell me that we can't stop anybody coming here on our dime who [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4287.94s)]
*  just feels like coming here. I'm ignoring you. I'm literally ignoring you. What are you going to do [[01:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4293.06s)]
*  about it? That's how I personally feel about it because that's the end of democracy. You're [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4297.22s)]
*  violating the people's will through your appointment power, your appointed power, not your elected [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4301.22s)]
*  power. The power does not derive from the population. It derives from the appointment [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4308.9800000000005s)]
*  that you got and you're making the central decision in our society. I don't think you are. [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4312.580000000001s)]
*  So how do they speed it up? I mean, Trump's done so much, Alien Enemies Act and he [[01:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4317.54s)]
*  expanded expedited removal and we're back to remain in Mexico and he has home and out. [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4322.74s)]
*  Like how does he speed it up? The first thing you do is just say not a, anyone who's a non-citizen, [[01:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4327.94s)]
*  a non-citizen in the United States is ineligible for any federal benefit. That means no public [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4334.98s)]
*  schooling. That means no food stamps or snap. That means no housing vouchers. That means no [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4339.94s)]
*  benefit designed for American citizens can go to a non-citizen. You want those benefits, [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4347.46s)]
*  become a citizen and if you're not a citizen, you get nothing. Why would you? How can you use, [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4352.82s)]
*  how are we sitting here and watching all every small hospital in the United States is going [[01:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4358.1s)]
*  under right now because people who have no right to be here are using the emergency room. Bring [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4364.26s)]
*  your kid to an emergency room outside of like some tiny gated rich community and you will find out [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4368.66s)]
*  that the whole system is collapsing under the weight. I'm sure they're all good people, [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4374.18s)]
*  not even attacking them. Like they're doing what I would do. They're using the available [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4377.9400000000005s)]
*  largesse to help their families. I get it. We're the criminals here. We're allowing this. So you [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4381.3s)]
*  just say now on executive order, no non-citizen period can receive federal benefits, period. [[01:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4386.34s)]
*  The president can control that and you know, then we'll find out who's here for a better life and [[01:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4394.34s)]
*  to bootstrap his way to success and who's here because there's just a lot of free stuff from a [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4399.62s)]
*  very weak, overindulgent, generationally wealthy country that has lost track of reality. And the [[01:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4405.7s)]
*  reality is open borders in a welfare state cannot coexist and we'll find out. We'll find out. [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4412.74s)]
*  We definitely have to make greater progress than this because I mean, [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4419.7s)]
*  it doesn't get easier as time goes on. That's not enough. 130,000 or so in the first 100 days is [[01:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4423.22s)]
*  underwhelming. Let me ask you about you. Every time I chat with you, you're all over hell and [[01:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4428.26s)]
*  gone. I don't know where you are. Describe your life these days. [[01:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4434.18s)]
*  Well, I'm hoping to go fishing this afternoon. [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4440.820000000001s)]
*  Are you currently up north or down south? [[01:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4444.66s)]
*  Yeah, yeah, no, I'm up in northern New England where, you know, we had a day on Sunday that was [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4447.22s)]
*  so ugly, slate gray skies, 40 degrees, drizzle, no buds on any tree at all, and salt and sand on [[01:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4453.46s)]
*  the roads from winter and everybody looking kind of like I just spent the last three months inside [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4464.18s)]
*  by the wood stove drinking coffee brandy. Like people just look like they've been through a war [[01:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4469.7s)]
*  as they do in cold climates in the spring. And I thought to myself, this is still the prettiest [[01:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4474.02s)]
*  place on earth. I've been everywhere in the world and this is the prettiest. Even on this, [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4478.34s)]
*  the ugliest out of 365 days, it's still the prettiest place God ever made. So I'm just [[01:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4482.42s)]
*  really grateful to live where I do and have been here a long time and I'm really thankful. [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4486.82s)]
*  I've had a lot of foreign travel. Here I've been like lecturing Ben Shapiro about how you need to [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4490.9800000000005s)]
*  care more about America and I'm like in all these other countries. So I understand that I'm a [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4496.74s)]
*  hypocrite and I am. I view it from where I sit as like adult education. I feel like you're pursuing [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4502.34s)]
*  a whole new education for yourself now that you have the time to do it. [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4508.42s)]
*  Well you certainly get a different perspective. I mean I have to say, you know, I've been to every [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4511.62s)]
*  state more than once, most of them a lot. I really know America pretty well. I've traveled my whole [[01:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4515.86s)]
*  life since I was a child and I've just seen a lot of stuff and I continue to think it's the, [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4520.02s)]
*  you know, you don't need to fly first class on Emirates to see the world. You can literally [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4524.82s)]
*  get in your truck and just drive a hundred miles and you just learn a lot of stuff. I mean yesterday [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4529.14s)]
*  I was visiting a friend in another state I was driving and I see this church, [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4533.3s)]
*  clearly it's an Episcopal church. Like it's obviously I know the design of our churches [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4537.86s)]
*  and there's no sign. So I pull up in front and I walk in and it's totally empty. The pews have [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4541.7s)]
*  been taken out, the altar's gone, there are no banners hanging from the ceiling and I'm like, [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4546.179999999999s)]
*  this is an abandoned stone Episcopal church. And I've been thinking about it ever since, [[01:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4550.0199999999995s)]
*  like the denomination I grew up with has totally collapsed because they forgot that God is the [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4554.98s)]
*  power that, you know, gets people in the pews on Sunday. Like, right, you give up God, your [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4559.219999999999s)]
*  church collapses. That's like, I just drove 80 miles yesterday and I learned that. Like that [[01:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4563.94s)]
*  expanded my head a little bit. Fly to Saudi Arabia for two weeks, like I did this winter. [[01:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4569.62s)]
*  Just go someplace new and see stuff and you just understand more. And it, the last thing I'll say [[01:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4573.7s)]
*  is like the main lie of the moment that we live in, the generation we live in, is that the truth [[01:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4579.62s)]
*  is accessible on your phone. That like if you Google enough you'll get to the truth of things [[01:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4584.0199999999995s)]
*  and that is just itself a lie. Like that's a, that's a total lie. And to some large extent it's [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4588.339999999999s)]
*  a control device designed to make you think things that aren't true and to lead you astray. [[01:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4593.06s)]
*  And the antidote to that is to put down your phone, smell things, see things, feel things, [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4597.9400000000005s)]
*  like go places, meet people, you know, take a deep breath through your nose. I'm a big sniff guy. [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4604.580000000001s)]
*  I'm on Joe Biden's side that way. I really believe in the olfactory sense is the most revealing one. [[01:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4610.42s)]
*  I sniff every person I meet. I never put anything in my mouth that's smelling it. Not one time in [[01:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4615.54s)]
*  my whole life. I really believe in that. And I'm going to pay attention to whether you smell me [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4619.38s)]
*  the next time I see you. Oh, I've sniffed you many times in a totally harmless way that would not [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4623.78s)]
*  threaten Doug at all. But I just sniff everybody. I really believe in that because you learn a lot [[01:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4629.3s)]
*  about someone by smell and vibe. And that's just real. I'm not, I'm hardly a hippie. Okay. But [[01:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4633.86s)]
*  that's just a fact. No, I've heard you talking about that before. You can't smell anything on [[01:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4638.900000000001s)]
*  the internet. Yes, it's totally real. I can identify my whole family by smell. My wife, [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4642.18s)]
*  yeah, I heard you say like each child. 100%. I know their smell. Insomniac. My wife, I mean, [[01:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4647.0599999999995s)]
*  I'm I'm literally like a wombat or something. If you are downwind, like I know. Sorry, excuse me. [[01:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4653.7s)]
*  That's impressive because they say females have a greater sense of smell than men have. So if [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4661.94s)]
*  you're that keen in your sense, then you're even more evolved than the average person. [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4666.82s)]
*  I'm less evolved. Okay. So that's good. All right. That's I, your point is get out there, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4672.34s)]
*  get touch grass, all that. And on that front, you've been a big magga maha maha person in, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4679.54s)]
*  in that you helped launch Casey and Callie Means, who are basically the right hands of RFKJ right [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4686.26s)]
*  now, not to mention RFKJ himself had a huge hand in his comeback and ascension to this position. [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4691.86s)]
*  So how are you doing on that front? Because I do hear you talk about your love, [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4697.62s)]
*  yes, of Susie, but also of a woman we know as little Debbie. And I, I, are you practicing [[01:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4702.419999999999s)]
*  what you're preaching? Oh, my garbage food intake. Yes. And I've been on the road for so long. I mean, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4708.099999999999s)]
*  you can't imagine there are countries in which like the three meal program is just the beginning. [[01:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4717.139999999999s)]
*  I mean, there are countries, particularly in the Middle East, where it's like, [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4722.66s)]
*  would you like some more hummus and pita bread? How about some dates? And I just I mean, I have, [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4725.86s)]
*  I quit drinking, I quit smoking cigarettes, I quit drugs, I feel like I've quit deodorant. I mean, [[01:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4730.58s)]
*  like, I'm totally straight edge about everything. Okay. Yeah. But I just have a huge weakness. I was [[01:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4736.74s)]
*  thinking about that this morning. I was in my sauna. And I'm like, I gotta, I gotta stop eating [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4742.82s)]
*  garbage. So no, that is definitely one of my huge problems. My other problem is I just want as someone [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4746.98s)]
*  who is really, really hoping above all things for grandchildren, I want the vaccine schedule to [[01:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4753.86s)]
*  change for kids. I just think it's really I don't know why that hasn't changed. I think it will too. [[01:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4759.94s)]
*  I haven't complained. But I just if you're asking like my view of it, and what I want, I want that [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4764.74s)]
*  because I'm going to have grandchildren and I'm I think going to really care about them more than [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4770.5s)]
*  anything. And I don't want them injected with all that stuff at all. Like, I mean, I really [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4774.98s)]
*  feel like Bobby Kennedy, he definitely he said he had all of his kids vaccinated, but he wishes he [[01:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4780.5s)]
*  had more information. That's what he keeps saying. He just wants us to have more information before we [[01:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4786.5s)]
*  make the same decision with our kids or our grandkids. And what's wrong with that? Why [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4790.18s)]
*  why shouldn't we know like this one's this one's there to prevent a sexually transmitted disease [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4794.18s)]
*  in your one hour year old, right? We should know. Well, that's it. It's just there's there's a lot [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4799.14s)]
*  of coercion in health care. And I just watched this firsthand with a with a dying parent. And [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4806.74s)]
*  there's and I think everyone I've ever met, like doctor, especially the nurses, like they're all [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4812.099999999999s)]
*  great people. They're motivated by the right impulses. I think I would not I don't think [[01:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4816.66s)]
*  they're bad at all. I really admire and love them. But I think the system they work within pushes [[01:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4821.38s)]
*  toward certain protocols like with serious vehemence. It's like, well, that's what we do, [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4826.9s)]
*  you know, like this person needs, you know, an opiate. And it's like, well, he doesn't want it, [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4831.94s)]
*  actually. Well, he needs it. Or this child needs a vaccine. Well, I don't think we're going to do [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4836.339999999999s)]
*  that because I don't think my one day old is going to get an STD. Well, we you know, I think there [[01:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4841.299999999999s)]
*  needs to be more respect for choices. Like you should be allowed to turn down certain treatments [[01:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4846.5s)]
*  or prophylactics without being lectured by somebody like I think that's really important [[01:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4854.179999999999s)]
*  for information providing. I think that's what's been kept from us on the vaccines. They don't they [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4860.18s)]
*  don't share to this day. They're not really making a thing out of the myocarditis that is so common [[01:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4864.58s)]
*  with young teenage boys who take the umpteenth COVID booster like that we know because we're in [[01:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4870.82s)]
*  this ecosystem. But this is not something that they promote or want us to know about. And that's kind [[01:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4875.94s)]
*  of been the theme of our whole discussion today. Like, why can't we talk about it? Why can't we [[01:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4880.42s)]
*  talk about the risks when it comes to Iran? Why can't we talk about potential Israeli over [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4884.58s)]
*  reach when it comes to the war in Gaza? Why can't we talk about the downsides of vaccines? Why can't [[01:21:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4889.54s)]
*  we talk about immigration without being called names like this? It's a theme and it to me it [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4894.18s)]
*  just gets to the tools that the left use to try to stifle conversation or arguments that might [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4900.1s)]
*  undercut their favorite things. And it's just their day is over Tucker and it's over. Our day is here [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4905.22s)]
*  where we get to talk about it all. It has a amen and it has a counterproductive effect and I see it [[01:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4910.98s)]
*  in myself. Like, I'm not going to allow myself to become a bigot on the question of Israel, [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4915.62s)]
*  period. I'm just not going to allow it. I know that that's a risk. I see other people fall [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4920.34s)]
*  prey to that. I'm not I'm not doing that, period. So that's not going to happen to me. But I do see [[01:22:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4923.86s)]
*  it happening on medical questions and science questions because I was attacked so viciously [[01:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4929.14s)]
*  for asking questions about the vaccine during COVID. And I find myself driven to like an [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4936.18s)]
*  extremist position like I'm just not going to the doctor ever. I'm not going to the doctor. I get [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4940.98s)]
*  cancer. I'm not taking chemotherapy. That's crazy. But I feel that in myself because I'm reacting [[01:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4944.98s)]
*  against unfair attacks on my character just for asking I thought pretty normal low IQ questions. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4951.459999999999s)]
*  Just very simple questions. And I am responding to that because every action has an equal and [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4957.219999999999s)]
*  opposite reaction like in life as in physics. And we need to check ourselves to make sure that we're [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4962.98s)]
*  not becoming crazy. And I just know on health care questions, I have become crazy. Like I'm not [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4968.74s)]
*  putting I don't know what is wrong with fluoride, but it's not in my toothpaste. I'm not like I've [[01:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4973.7s)]
*  really gone like to the far extreme. Like I'm not the doctor tells me to get a shingles vaccine. [[01:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4978.74s)]
*  Well, he wouldn't because I don't go to the doctor. But let's say I went to the doctor. [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4983.94s)]
*  And he's like, get a shingles vaccine. I would like raise my fingers and across and like back [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4986.9s)]
*  away slowly. I don't even know what a shingles vaccine is. I'm just saying, okay, I am radicalized [[01:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4990.66s)]
*  to avoid that. Like I got the shingles vaccine because my well, we had a family member who got [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=4996.58s)]
*  shingles. She got it in her eye. And then at the tip of her nose and she's she got scarred from it. [[01:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5000.66s)]
*  It was all I was I'm too vain Tucker, you know, you know, I'm all maha all the way, but it's not [[01:23:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5006.18s)]
*  going to stop my Botox and my makeup and my hairspray. And we we could go maybe I'm not maha, [[01:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5009.78s)]
*  actually come to think of it. [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5017.22s)]
*  I love that. [[01:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5018.26s)]
*  We're honest, which is what I love. You're an honest person. That's, that's the that's the only [[01:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5019.46s)]
*  thing we should be shooting for is honesty, I think. [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5024.82s)]
*  Well, I'm honestly very happy to see you. Thanks for coming on. All the best. See you soon. I hope [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5027.14s)]
*  great to see you. Thank you. See ya. [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5032.42s)]
*  The best Tucker Carlson, everybody check out his show. Sure you have already. But of course, [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5035.38s)]
*  he's crushing it. And just one of the most important voices in the American conversation [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5039.54s)]
*  today. Thank God for him. Up next, I mentioned it with Tucker. It is fentanyl awareness day. [[01:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5044.1s)]
*  And there are some facts I saw in this documentary that our next guests are going to talk to you about [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5050.26s)]
*  that I had no clue about. And I've covered this kind of story for many, many years. [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5055.46s)]
*  And honestly, there was one particular moment, believe it or not, where I thought to myself, [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5062.34s)]

*  for me personally. As I've shared with you before, my sister had an opioid problem through no fault [[01:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5209.78s)]

*  were saying to patients, it's not addictive, which is not the same thing as fentanyl. Fentanyl is far [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5221.86s)]
*  more dangerous. Frankly, it's more lethal, but it's a similar road. And then my dear friend, [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5226.74s)]

*  was a Xanax that was laced with fentanyl, which is extremely common. And Eric, on one of our very [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5244.26s)]

*  new documentary called Fentanyl Death Incorporated. It's only an hour long and it's so worth your time. [[01:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5302.26s)]
*  It's shining the light on just how dire and far reaching the fentanyl crisis in America really is. [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5309.38s)]
*  Here's a bit from it. Watch. [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5314.98s)]
*  Stabilizing the border to traffic enough fentanyl to kill the entire population of a country many [[01:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5344.98s)]
*  times over. This is the ports of British Columbia where chemicals to make fentanyl are smuggled in [[01:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5349.219999999999s)]
*  by the tonnage and Canadian super labs are producing fentanyl to export to countries around the [[01:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5354.179999999999s)]
*  world. These are gangs and drug dealers near you haphazardly mixing fentanyl powder with other [[01:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5358.179999999999s)]
*  chemicals like xylazine, which is a horse tranquilizer causing the user's skin to fall off. [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5363.379999999999s)]
*  But hey, at least the eye lasts longer. [[01:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5368.5s)]
*  Hmm. Joining me now, Dr. Robert Marbitt, producer of the documentary along with [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5372.82s)]
*  Billy Baldwin, actor and narrator of the documentary. Guys, welcome to the show. Thank [[01:29:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5377.78s)]
*  you so much for being here. It's such a heavy subject and it's such an important one. And I [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5382.9800000000005s)]
*  could not believe the numbers. Can I just start with this? Dr. Marbitt, I'll start with you. [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5389.14s)]
*  The problem you showed about 28 minutes in the documentary. We all think about the southern [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5395.78s)]
*  border, all our focus is on the southern border. And I mentioned in the tease how Vivek [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5400.82s)]
*  Ramaswamy was right about something because at a presidential debate, he said the northern border [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5405.54s)]
*  and he said we need to watch the northern border because of fentanyl and people mocked him because [[01:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5409.46s)]
*  it was like the northern border. But you guys make the point in this documentary, it's actually also [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5414.259999999999s)]
*  the East Coast and the West Coast. It's the entire border that is being attacked by bad actors trying [[01:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5419.14s)]
*  to flood our country with this poison. We have a problem with all of our borders, but a lot of [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5425.3s)]
*  people forget the U.S. Canadian border is the longest land border between any two countries in [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5432.34s)]
*  the world. So it's not just blame domain. It's also the Western frontier of Canada and the [[01:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5438.18s)]
*  eastern side of Alaska. We have poorest borders, have had poorest borders all around. And it's not [[01:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5444.66s)]
*  just the southwest border, it's the northern border and it's our ports of entry, especially on the [[01:30:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5453.0599999999995s)]
*  waterways. Exactly. So don't think for one second, just because we're in better control of the [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5458.26s)]
*  southern border right now, that this problem is under control. It's not. And one of the things [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5464.18s)]
*  you learn from the documentary, Billy, is that it doesn't take much at all. It's like a grain of salt [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5469.46s)]
*  that can make its way into a pill you thought was like in Eric Bowling's son's case, a Xanax or like [[01:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5475.94s)]
*  a Percocet or something that young people in particular might be taking just, quote, to take [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5481.86s)]
*  the edge off or just maybe to get a temporary high. It only takes a minuscule amount to kill. [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5486.34s)]
*  Well, first of all, thank you so much, Megan, for having me. And I know Eric indirectly through some [[01:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5492.66s)]
*  college buddies of mine on Wall Street. And I'm getting chills at a little of a clump just hearing [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5499.46s)]
*  him, you know, his son didn't die in vain. And the work that's going on right now, well, the loss of [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5505.46s)]
*  his son will save thousands and thousands of lives moving forward because we have programs that are [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5513.7s)]
*  working. We do have solutions. There is hope. But, you know, right now we have 4.2% of the world's [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5519.78s)]
*  population. We consume 38% of the world's fentanyl. We have 66% of the global deaths from fentanyl. [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5526.74s)]
*  A sugar packet, a sweet and low packet has enough fentanyl in it to kill 500 people [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5535.3s)]
*  in a sugar packet you get in your coffee in the morning. More people have died from fentanyl [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5542.34s)]
*  since 2019 in four and a half years than every casualty we've taken in World War II, Vietnam, [[01:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5548.98s)]
*  Korea, Desert Shield, Desert Storm, Afghanistan, Kosovo, every casualty we've had. We had 58,000 [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5556.74s)]
*  plus die in the 15 year campaign in Vietnam. 58,000 plus. We had 100,000 die last year alone. [[01:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5564.66s)]
*  Oh my gosh. We had double Vietnam in one year. And this sounds like, I'll say many controversial [[01:32:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5573.38s)]
*  things that will probably make you very happy, Megan, with my position on this issue. But, [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5581.46s)]
*  you know, it's kind of a blessing. This is a hard thing to say, but it's a blessing [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5589.46s)]
*  that it's not just happening in super uneducated poor Appalachian families or in Compton and in [[01:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5595.9400000000005s)]

*  a year and a half ago, 18 year old freshmen, same exact thing happened. In our documentary, [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5610.34s)]
*  you have a woman who said her girlfriend never did drugs. She woke up one day, had a couple [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5615.06s)]
*  glasses of champagne at a sorority party or something, had a little bit of a hangover. [[01:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5619.9400000000005s)]
*  They said, here, take this. This will make your hangover go away. She took it. She went back to [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5623.54s)]
*  bed to sleep over a hangover. Never did drugs in her life. And she never woke up. And this is, [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5627.3s)]
*  it's such a national absolute catastrophe at this point with the numbers that it's got everybody's [[01:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5634.1s)]
*  attention on the right, on the left, in the news media, everybody. If you had to look at it, doc, [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5643.38s)]
*  and say, you know, what's causing this? My takeaway from watching the documentary, again, [[01:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5648.98s)]
*  and it's called fentanyl death incorporated.com. And it's going to be hitting soon. I would say [[01:34:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5653.379999999999s)]
*  it's the Chinese who are providing these precursor ingredients, the Mexican cartels, which then take [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5660.5s)]

*  got going only 15 years ago. This is a real recent deal. And we have to understand it really starts [[01:35:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5701.3s)]
*  with in the United States with the Purdue pharma crisis and scandal. We had millions of people, [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5708.42s)]

*  lawsuits happen and all the prescriptions stopped getting handed out, doled out, what happened was [[01:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5721.38s)]
*  the Mexican cartels with China backfilled that supply in as quick as 90 days. They, they, they're [[01:35:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5729.54s)]
*  horrible people, horrible actors, but they're incredible entrepreneurs. And they saw a market [[01:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5737.38s)]
*  that was now not being served. And they came in and backfilled it immediately. And it went, and I [[01:35:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5743.54s)]
*  think, and I went to China for three weeks on the movie, both research and shooting. And I think in [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5750.18s)]

*  while making money. And so they had this unholy alliance between the Chinese communist party and [[01:36:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5768.58s)]
*  the Mexican cartels. And now it's moved up to Canada. And now you have the biker gangs in Canada [[01:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5775.9400000000005s)]
*  backfilling what the biker gangs, they're starting to backfill what the Mexican cartels were starting [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5782.74s)]
*  to do at the beginning. You know, it's really crazy because Trump has been in the news for the [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5789.7s)]
*  tariff wars, I mean, for everything, but the tariff wars. And one of the things he was saying about [[01:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5795.62s)]
*  Canada was I want them to crack down on the fentanyl crisis. And I have to admit, a lot of people [[01:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5799.46s)]
*  just kind of laughed at him. It's like, Canada is not the problem. Hello, it's Mexico. But it wasn't [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5805.0599999999995s)]
*  until I saw your film that I was like, Oh my God, actually, Canada is a huge part of the problem, [[01:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5809.7s)]
*  Billy, because these cartels got smart. And they realize, especially under Trump now, the southern [[01:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5815.7s)]
*  border is going to be different, more difficult. And because we're so close with Canada, we've kept [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5821.46s)]
*  that much more porous. Canada is not a problem, only a problem for America. Canada's problem for [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5826.58s)]
*  Canada. Vancouver is a war zone right now. Vancouver looks like Portland. I mean, it's really, [[01:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5832.5s)]
*  really, really getting bad up there. And you have to remember this border is, as Dr. Marvett said, [[01:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5838.74s)]
*  is the longest land border between two countries in the world. Plus we have the US border to the [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5842.74s)]
*  north, not including Alaska. And we have patrols that are literally in kayaks on ATVs, on mountain [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5846.98s)]
*  bikes, and they can't cover it all. Many of the people on the northern border that are working [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5856.9s)]
*  for border patrol are processing people being deported on the southern border. They're doing [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5861.7s)]
*  the northern patrol is doing the paperwork for people that are guarding the border in the south. [[01:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5867.459999999999s)]
*  So we need to beefen up the northern border. And as you said, this is not going to be addressed [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5872.179999999999s)]
*  only on the supply side. The current Mexican president and previous Mexican president will [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5879.139999999999s)]
*  tell you, we can take out one or two cartels and five or six will grow back as long as the demand [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5885.219999999999s)]
*  is there. And if we're 4% of the world's population consuming nearly 40% of this drug and the profit [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5890.099999999999s)]
*  is there, if you take care of one cartel, someone else is going to come in from the Gulf of Mexico, [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5896.74s)]
*  or they're going to come in from Cape Hatteras, or they're going to come in from on a kayak. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5901.7s)]
*  I mean, right now, as you saw in the documentary, there is a park in BC called Peace Arch Park. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5906.82s)]
*  And the beauty of our relationship with Canada is they want people to walk through the arch of [[01:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5913.54s)]
*  the park and go to the other side of the border and put down a blanket and have a barbeque, [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5916.74s)]
*  not have a barbeque, have a picnic there. And that's the beauty of our open border. Well, [[01:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5921.46s)]
*  guess what? People are coming to that border with a backpack on, they walk across the border, [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5926.02s)]
*  they get in an Uber, they go to Spokane or Seattle or Portland with 5,000 hits of fentanyl. [[01:38:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5930.02s)]
*  And that's how it's getting across the border through Peace Arch Park. [[01:38:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5937.3s)]
*  And the film documents also at the southern border how they are very clever, the cartels, [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5940.900000000001s)]
*  they will intentionally send people to sneak across the border, which they know will attract [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5945.06s)]
*  the border patrol. And they know exactly how many border patrol agents they are to this area over [[01:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5950.740000000001s)]
*  here on the left, leaving open the area on the right and relatively unpatrolled. And that's where [[01:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5955.14s)]
*  they'll send across the carriers with the fentanyl, because the whole thing is a decoy to really get [[01:39:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5960.02s)]
*  the drugs across the border and into the country. That's much more lucrative for them than just, [[01:39:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5965.3s)]
*  you know, sending whatever getting paid to get people into the country illegally. [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5969.22s)]
*  So it's extremely sophisticated. And not only we didn't even talk about yet, the cargo ships that [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5973.62s)]
*  come in, huge, huge cargo ships, we check less than 1% of these, I think it's even lower than that. [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5980.18s)]
*  And many of them have boxes and boxes of this stuff. So we're just it's coming in from all angles. [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5987.46s)]
*  You need to tell someone that's thinking about purchasing a pill on social media or getting a [[01:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5993.38s)]
*  pill from a friend that six out of every 10 illicit drugs that you purchase right now, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=5996.9800000000005s)]
*  60% of all the illicit drugs out there, crack, meth, fentanyl, heroin, whatever it is, 60% of them [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6002.820000000001s)]
*  are contaminated with illicit fentanyl right now. So you're literally playing Russian roulette with [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6009.94s)]
*  your life. That is shocking. We are back talking about the film fentanyl death incorporated, [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6014.419999999999s)]
*  which you can find at fentanyl death incorporated.com. This is fentanyl awareness day. [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6021.78s)]
*  And Doc, you go through in the film, how this thing a originated how it came about, because [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6027.86s)]
*  it like wasn't a thing in the recent past, it was it's a relatively new phenomenon. And also just [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6033.86s)]
*  for those listening at home, the fact that Narcan will not save you from a fentanyl overdose. I think [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6040.66s)]
*  most people think you can that's that drug they want you to have around in case somebody ods at [[01:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6047.7s)]
*  a frat party or whatever. Narcan will not be of any use to you if somebody ods on this drug. [[01:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6051.86s)]
*  And what we're starting to see now is fentanyl is getting mixed with so many different things like [[01:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6058.66s)]
*  course tranquilizer, even meth. And so you have a high and a downer at the same thing, [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6064.42s)]
*  and it's really wreaking havoc on your heart. And what we have to think about is things like Narcan [[01:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6071.38s)]
*  are purely a short term fix, and it will not fix the long run, it will not fix the intermediate. [[01:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6078.259999999999s)]
*  And unless we start thinking about treatment and recovery, and not getting addicted in the first [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6086.18s)]
*  place, Narcan will just postpone the death to another day, unless you start get the treatment [[01:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6092.34s)]
*  and the recovery going. And in the United States, we have really made it easy to get high and hard [[01:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6099.46s)]
*  to get treatment rather than making it easy to get treatment and hard to get high. That's one of [[01:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6105.860000000001s)]
*  the stunning things. Billy, you watch this film, and we've covered it as a new show. City after [[01:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6111.86s)]
*  city has provided like clean needles or even a nurse who will be with you when you inject your [[01:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6117.0599999999995s)]
*  drug or take your drug to make sure you don't die. And you make the point over and over, you can find [[01:42:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6121.7s)]
*  that very easily in the United States, finding treatment and rehabilitory systems or spots much, [[01:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6127.86s)]
*  much harder. And if you do find a place that's like a drug rehab that really works, they tend [[01:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6134.82s)]
*  to be exorbitantly priced. Most people can't afford them. It's just incredibly hard to get help. [[01:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6140.02s)]
*  Yeah, I think the left policies over the last 15 years of no harm and low harm [[01:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6147.780000000001s)]
*  were very, very well intended. They haven't produced the results that they had hoped. [[01:42:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6154.5s)]
*  They have to course correct. Ironically, the providing a safe place to get high was not [[01:42:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6158.9800000000005s)]
*  a left policy. That was the police department that didn't want to spread their resources out [[01:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6165.22s)]
*  over many, many different places, say in Portland or in Spokane or in Sacramento. [[01:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6170.66s)]
*  And they wanted to provide this so they can monitor it and control and make sure they were [[01:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6176.02s)]
*  keeping people alive. That was a policing tactic. But low bar and no bar is a big problem because [[01:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6181.14s)]
*  in California and in Portland and Seattle, they were talking about providing housing. Well, [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6188.5s)]
*  it's great when you take a mentally ill addict who's homeless and provide housing. You've checked [[01:43:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6192.66s)]
*  one box. They're no longer homeless, but they're still mentally ill and they're still addicted to [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6197.46s)]
*  fentanyl. So it leads us to when I have this conversation and I say it's going to require the [[01:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6203.94s)]
*  kind of services that Dr. Marbot's providing for his Haven of Hope in San Antonio that services [[01:43:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6210.5s)]
*  2,700 people with a success rate of over 70%, getting people on their feet off out of the system, [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6215.54s)]
*  off the services, totally self-sufficient, totally independent. And when I talk about 360 degree [[01:43:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6223.14s)]
*  universal care, they're like, Whoa, that sounds incredibly expensive. Who's going to pay for that? [[01:43:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6228.74s)]
*  And I say, you're already paying too much for not enough results. Right now you call 911, [[01:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6235.62s)]
*  fire department, police department, sheriffs, paramedics respond. You pay, they go to the [[01:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6242.9s)]
*  emergency room. You pay, they get admitted. You pay, they go into the legal system, judges, lawyers, [[01:44:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6247.62s)]
*  courtrooms, you pay, they get incarcerated. You pay, let's go downtown, Main Street. We were in [[01:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6253.139999999999s)]
*  Seattle. This gentleman, 21 year old kid blessing was overdosing. They hit him with Narcan, revived [[01:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6259.46s)]
*  him. They hit him with paddles, got his heart started again. He vomited. He turned around and [[01:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6266.179999999999s)]
*  said to the fire department, get lost. I don't want your help. That was right in front of the [[01:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6270.74s)]
*  wharf in Seattle, the original Starbucks store. And he was laying on the ground in front of the [[01:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6274.82s)]
*  Nike store. You have to say, how does that, how is that affecting tourism, commerce, small business [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6279.54s)]
*  administration, property values. They're all declining in Northwestern cities. And we have [[01:44:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6286.179999999999s)]
*  to course correct. We have to provide these universal services, 360 services, because [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6291.7s)]
*  you're already paying too much to not get enough results. And Marbitt, maybe you want to jump in [[01:44:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6299.62s)]
*  here with some of the results of the care that's going on at Johns Hopkins and with City Gate and [[01:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6305.7s)]
*  with you at Haven for Hope. Think about this case with blessing that Billy and I saw. We had four [[01:45:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6311.0599999999995s)]
*  firemen arrive. We had two EMS arrive. We had two sheriff people arrive. We had three local downtown [[01:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6318.74s)]
*  ambassadors arrive. These are all taxpayer funded people. And they worked on them, got them alive [[01:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6327.46s)]
*  enough, and then he refused treatment. He refused going. And so that's why places like Johns Hopkins [[01:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6333.62s)]
*  in Baltimore has a program with the Helping Up mission. And they're working together. So you have [[01:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6341.06s)]
*  a secular university and a faith-based Christian mission working together. And they're having [[01:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6347.06s)]
*  phenomenal success. So we know how to do this, and we know how to do it right. But it takes time. [[01:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6353.62s)]
*  It's not going to be, you're not going to take somebody who's been addicted to drugs for 20 years [[01:46:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6360.5s)]
*  and do it in a 28-day program or a 14-day program. You need multiple months. But in the end, [[01:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6366.26s)]
*  it's much more cost effective to get success in real treatment and real recovery than the short-term [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6373.22s)]
*  expenses of band-aids that are the police department, the fire department, emergency room, [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6380.02s)]
*  emergency department, and the court systems. Let me ask you this, Doc. I don't understand totally, [[01:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6385.38s)]
*  because people can take fentanyl without dying. I remember 15 years ago, I think, my mom had a back [[01:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6391.540000000001s)]
*  surgery, and they gave her a fentanyl lollipop. And this is before that word meant anything to [[01:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6397.780000000001s)]
*  anybody. I was like, what's that? But boy, she was flying high. And so it's not like if you just [[01:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6404.02s)]
*  touch fentanyl or taste fentanyl, you'll die. But what's happening? Is it corrupted fentanyl [[01:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6410.820000000001s)]
*  that's going into these pills? Because I use the term OD on fentanyl, which that's not exactly it. [[01:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6416.9800000000005s)]
*  Just a small, tiny amount of one time with fentanyl can kill you. [[01:47:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6422.34s)]
*  Dr. Mark Segal There's a huge difference between medical-grade fentanyl, like a cancer patch for [[01:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6427.06s)]
*  stage three, stage four cancer patients, or the lollipop post-surgery. Or candidly, medical fentanyl [[01:47:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6434.1s)]
*  has made heart surgery possible. I mean, it's perfect because it slows your heart rate down, [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6442.02s)]
*  it slows your breathing down. So fentanyl for open heart surgery is critical. But the difference is, [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6447.860000000001s)]
*  when you're in those situations, they're highly regulated. And the dosing is very, very precise [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6453.94s)]
*  and done with precision. And when you're in a medical situation, you have multiple people [[01:47:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6462.419999999999s)]
*  monitoring you. The problem with street-level fentanyl, illicit fentanyl that's on the street, [[01:47:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6468.339999999999s)]
*  there is no regulation. And so they make this batch not in a white-glove lab, it's done in a jungle, [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6474.259999999999s)]
*  a back alley, a burnout bus. And you don't know what you're getting. It's a mix. It's not equal [[01:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6481.14s)]
*  at the same time. You might get part of the batch that has a lot of fentanyl, and the other part has [[01:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6488.5s)]
*  none of it. And so street-level illicit fentanyl is totally different than the fentanyl you get [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6493.62s)]
*  in a hospital. Dr. Mark Segal [[01:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6500.02s)]
*  And then on top of that, they mislabel it. Yeah, go ahead, Billy. [[01:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6501.62s)]
*  You know, getting back to this kid's blessing, he was gone. He was flatlined. They revived him. [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6505.38s)]
*  He vomited and turned over and said, I refuse your help. And the reason they do this is not just [[01:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6512.1s)]
*  because the high is so good. They do this because the way they feel emotionally, psychologically, [[01:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6518.5s)]
*  and physically when they're not on the drug is so terrifying. It's so painful to them that they [[01:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6524.18s)]
*  would rather risk their life. We were speaking to the fire department in Spokane, and they had a 9-1-1 [[01:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6530.02s)]
*  call for the same person six times in one day. And this leads me to something that's radical [[01:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6535.700000000001s)]
*  that I'm going to say that doesn't sound very left because they talk about the freedom, the [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6543.620000000001s)]
*  freedom, the freedom. Someone does have the freedom to get high. Someone does have the freedom to be [[01:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6546.740000000001s)]
*  homeless. Someone has the freedom to do drugs. And if they overdose and they die, that is free. But [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6550.580000000001s)]
*  not when it costs you and me, the taxpayers money. That's not freedom for us to have to pay for the [[01:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6555.54s)]
*  emergency room and for incarceration and for all the different ways in which this is affecting our [[01:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6561.14s)]
*  lives. So I've done conservatorships before. A definition of a conservatorship is a threat to [[01:49:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6564.9s)]
*  your life and others, or you harm yourself or others. Clearly, this kid blessing was a threat [[01:49:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6570.66s)]
*  to himself and others overdosing and flatlining on the street. Clearly, he was a harm to himself [[01:49:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6579.78s)]
*  and others. I am suggesting, and I'm not an expert. I want to leave it to the professionals, [[01:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6584.82s)]
*  the paramedics, the lawyers, the doctors, all of those people that have the nonprofits that have [[01:49:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6589.62s)]
*  their sleeves rolled up and they're getting their hands dirty, literally in the encampments, like I [[01:49:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6595.219999999999s)]
*  did for a long time, but the encampments and the shelters. I want to give them the ability to take [[01:49:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6599.78s)]
*  conservatorship out of the courts. And if blessing says, no, I'm not going, and a fireman and a [[01:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6604.58s)]
*  paramedic and a sheriff or a cop or a nonprofit say, you're going. And that person is taken [[01:50:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6612.26s)]
*  against their will because they are clearly a threat to themselves and others, and they have [[01:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6619.54s)]
*  clearly harmed themselves. And if you put it in the court system, it's a ticking clock. It's a [[01:50:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6623.62s)]
*  ticking bomb where you're waiting for them to potentially harm somebody else. So I don't know [[01:50:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6628.34s)]
*  how long they should be held, but a 72 hour hold is probably not long enough from what I've learned. [[01:50:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6632.900000000001s)]
*  So if they're held five, seven, 10 days, and they can get you a more detox, clearheaded position [[01:50:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6639.22s)]
*  where they say, you're right, I do need the services. I do need the help. I'll go into [[01:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6645.46s)]
*  a three or four month program. Or if they say, no, I want to go back on the streets, [[01:50:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6650.099999999999s)]
*  at least they've done it from a more sober, clearheaded perspective. And I'm wondering [[01:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6653.78s)]
*  if we should take the conservatorships as a pilot program, take it away from the judges and the [[01:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6658.18s)]
*  lawyers in the courtrooms and put it in the hands of people that know far better than they do. [[01:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6662.9s)]
*  That makes perfect sense because you point out the documentary that you actually can't detox off of [[01:51:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6667.14s)]
*  fentanyl on your own. You actually must have medical assistance there, doc. So why wouldn't [[01:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6674.74s)]
*  we be taking the word of an active addict to fentanyl for anything on the street? Why wouldn't [[01:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6680.66s)]
*  there be a mandatory, no, you're going into mandatory detox where for five, seven days, [[01:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6686.34s)]
*  whatever the appropriate period is, we will get you off this drug and then we can talk about what [[01:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6692.34s)]
*  comes next. We have some people from Seattle in our documentary who address this. They say, [[01:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6696.18s)]
*  if you were to go and go on a bridge and say you're going to commit suicide and get ready to jump [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6703.700000000001s)]
*  and somebody calls 911 or you get one of those bridge phones that they call the police come, [[01:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6711.62s)]
*  they don't just sit there and take you off the bridge and say, well, are you okay? You promise [[01:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6717.06s)]
*  not to jump. We'll leave you right there and then roll on. They take you there. Why is that not [[01:52:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6721.14s)]
*  different with fentanyl? Because we know fentanyl is so deadly now. You will not meet somebody who [[01:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6728.1s)]
*  is a fentanyl addict that's been on fentanyl for over 18 months. Most addicts die within eight or [[01:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6735.06s)]
*  nine months. A few will make it out to 18 months. So why would we not treat you like a jumper? Why [[01:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6741.06s)]
*  wouldn't we treat you like we need to take you in? We need medical detox because that's the only [[01:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6747.94s)]
*  way you're going to get down. We're not talking years of holding. We're talking five, six, [[01:52:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6753.78s)]
*  seven, eight, nine days. Get past that medical recovery and then have an honest conversation, [[01:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6760.5s)]
*  a clear-headed conversation about what do we need to do for treatment and recovery. Because [[01:52:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6766.98s)]
*  Billy and I have gone in multiple cities around this country with police departments and we roll [[01:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6773.3s)]
*  up on these fentanyl deaths. They're literally dead on the street and they get them recovered. [[01:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6778.98s)]
*  They get them back and they refuse to go in and treatment. They're not in a place mentally to [[01:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6784.66s)]
*  make a clean-headed decision to say, I want to go in for treatment. In the film, some of these people [[01:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6794.58s)]
*  have taken a fentanyl version that's mixed with this horse tranquilizer. It literally makes their [[01:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6800.82s)]
*  skin peel off of their bodies and you show pictures of people this is happening to. This is not a [[01:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6806.98s)]
*  person who is in a position to make the right decisions for his wellness. But back to the other [[01:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6813.54s)]
*  issue too, I wanted to ask you this Billy. When I was at NBC, I interviewed this family, the Savage [[01:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6819.46s)]
*  family. They had I think four boys and the two oldest boys were 18 and 19. They did not OD on [[01:53:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6824.98s)]
*  fentanyl but they came back from college. The one came back from college, I think the other was a [[01:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6833.62s)]
*  senior in high school. She waited up for them. They got home at midnight and unbeknownst to her, [[01:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6837.7s)]
*  they had prior to leaving this party both taken a pill that they thought was like a Xanax or [[01:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6843.459999999999s)]
*  something like that. It was an opioid of some kind and it killed them both. This poor mom woke [[01:54:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6850.1s)]
*  up the next morning thinking her kids were safe asleep. She had seen them home from the party [[01:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6858.18s)]
*  only to wake up the next morning to find out her 18 and 19 year old boys. I know it's horrific. [[01:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6862.900000000001s)]
*  But one of the things she said to me was, I'm a nurse and her husband was there too. They said, [[01:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6868.9800000000005s)]
*  we talked to our boys about drugs, about all the dangers. We were aware of the dangers [[01:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6874.66s)]
*  but we hadn't thought about this like a friend gives you a pill at a party and you should not [[01:54:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6882.18s)]
*  trust it or you're at a friend's house and they take a bottle out of their mom's medicine cabinet. [[01:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6890.98s)]
*  Yeah, my friends laugh when I say this because I say to my children all the time when I was in [[01:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6897.22s)]
*  college, someone would walk up and I went to Binghamton and you'd have people from Albany [[01:55:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6902.9s)]
*  and from Cornell and from Syracuse come to visit for the weekend and somebody would walk up, [[01:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6908.259999999999s)]
*  that was your buddy, but their friends from Syracuse and Albany would walk up and somebody [[01:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6912.5s)]
*  would light up a joint and say, yo, you want a hit? They'd pass it around. I said to my children, [[01:55:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6915.78s)]
*  those days are over. You literally put your drink down and you go to the bathroom, you come back [[01:55:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6922.0199999999995s)]
*  and the drink's still there, throw it out. Go make yourself another drink. Those days are over. [[01:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6926.259999999999s)]
*  When I have this sort of bring your own stash mentality, my kids are like, oh, great parenting [[01:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6931.06s)]
*  there, Baldwin, great parenting there, but I know the kids are going to do some of this that they're [[01:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6935.860000000001s)]
*  going to have. They're in college. My kids go to USC. They're going to have a beer. They're going [[01:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6940.42s)]
*  to have a cocktail. They're going to have a tequila. They're going to have a joint. You just have to [[01:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6945.22s)]
*  be very, very careful. Another point I wanted to touch upon, which I think is important, Megan, [[01:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6948.820000000001s)]
*  is the criminalization of this. Generations ago, my father's generation, when people got in trouble, [[01:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6953.3s)]
*  judges would say, I'm going to give you a choice. You got five years in jail or you got five years [[01:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6961.14s)]
*  in the army. You choose. It would depend on the type of crime, all sorts of variables, [[01:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6966.580000000001s)]
*  but they gave them a choice to either go to prison or to go into the service to rehabilitate. [[01:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6972.02s)]
*  Turned a lot of lives around. We have to raise this from a misdemeanor to a felony. We have to [[01:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6978.34s)]
*  get a lot of this into drug court and we have to say to a lot of these people, you're going to [[01:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6984.26s)]
*  prison for two years, not just dealers, repeat offenders that are users. You're going to prison [[01:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6988.26s)]
*  for two years or you're going to a government paid for facility. The government will pay for it. [[01:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6993.54s)]
*  You choose six months in rehab or two years in prison. You're going to one or the other. You're [[01:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=6999.3s)]
*  not going back out on the street. They have to change the legality of this. By the way, [[01:56:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7004.1s)]
*  what years were you at Binghamton? Can I ask that? 81 to 85. Oh yeah. You're a little bit [[01:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7008.74s)]
*  older than I was at Syracuse. I was at Syracuse at 88 to 92. My mother, my father, and all four of [[01:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7013.54s)]
*  my grandparents graduated from Syracuse. Oh nice. Go Orange. All right. Well, so I was not offered [[01:57:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7020.0199999999995s)]
*  a joint by you because we weren't in the same place at the same time. But let's pretend nobody [[01:57:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7025.78s)]
*  ever offered you a joint because I know that you went to Syracuse. But can I just add, my audience [[01:57:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7030.9s)]
*  knows I've never tried a drug. I mean, I've done alcohol. Good for you. No drugs. I'm sort of a [[01:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7035.86s)]
*  Pollyanna, I guess, in that lane. But Doc, I mean, even more so now, I mean, I'll talk to my kids [[01:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7040.98s)]
*  about this too. Like, you can't take a pill. You can't take a thing. You think you're not taking [[01:57:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7045.86s)]
*  fentanyl. You think you're taking like a muscle relaxant or something. Take an edge off before a [[01:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7050.339999999999s)]
*  big exam. What you're really taking is your life in your hands. And you had Tom Wolf there in the [[01:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7053.62s)]
*  bumper right up in the front there. 70% of all street level drugs now have some part of fentanyl [[01:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7061.78s)]
*  in it. And when you're talking about two grains of salt equivalent can kill anybody, or one grain [[01:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7069.38s)]
*  of rice can kill 15 people of equivalent of fentanyl. So we have to realize how potent these [[01:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7076.66s)]
*  drugs are, especially fentanyl. And the idea that we legalize fentanyl across large, many states [[01:58:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2x47clU02bo&t=7084.74s)]
