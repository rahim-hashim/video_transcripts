Video Description: Megyn Kelly reveals exclusive new details from the Nashville school shooter’s journals, what we can learn about the killer's obsession with gender identity and race, why we believe it's in the public's interest to know what was written and what was left out of the final Nashville police report, and more. Plus Victor Davis Hanson, author of "The End of Everything," joins to discuss President Trump’s tariff plan and the volatile media and market reaction today, why it’s important to take a deep breath and gain some perspective, what the goal actually is and why it's a slow process, the disconnect between rich conservatives and the working class, why the working class is more focused on trade fairness and employment opportunities than what happens in the stock market, how the Democratic Party has shifted towards representing elite interests, unhinged, self-important leftists freaking out about Trump and Elon, their narcissistic speeches at the weekend rallies, George Conway crying over Trump and his relationship with law firms, and more. Then Chris van Heerden, whose girlfriend is wrongfully detained in Russia, joins to discuss what led to his girlfriend being stuck in Russian prison for a 12 year sentence, how it was all over a $51 donation, the horrible conditions she's living in now, how he's hopeful about the Trump administration and his frustrating experience with the Biden administration, how Peter Berg and Dana White are helping, and more.

# EXCLUSIVE: Disturbing Writings From Nashville Shooter, and American Held in Russia, with VDH & More
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [April 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. He's been called the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=0.0s)]
*  disruptor in chief and that's exactly what Trump's tariffs are doing to the market today. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=4.32s)]
*  False reports of a Trump tariff pause saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average erase a morning [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=10.08s)]
*  1700 point loss to go up over 800 only for the market to go back to a loss of over 800 [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=16.48s)]
*  when it turned out the rumor wasn't true. Currently at 12 noon on Monday, it is down [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=27.64s)]
*  500 points back and forth. Look, you can't look. You can't look at it. I'm sure we've [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=34.2s)]
*  lost a lot of money. My mom is on a fixed income. It doesn't matter the income level. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=46.32s)]
*  You can't look at a moment like this. You're supposed to be in this market for a long term [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=52.68s)]
*  payoff if you're a younger person. And if you're an older person, you're also not supposed [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=61.88s)]
*  to sell when the market drops precipitously off of an event like tariffs. That's generally [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=66.26s)]
*  what they say. So looking is just bad for the soul and ultimately the pocketbook for [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=72.0s)]
*  many, many people. That's a general rule. And hopefully you've got a financial advisor [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=79.91999999999999s)]
*  telling you exactly what to do because people who just want to play the market like they're [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=86.0s)]
*  in a casino. Okay, I guess you should look. But somebody was just recirculating an old [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=91.36s)]
*  Trump quote because he used to own a casino in Atlantic City. There's no crying in the [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=97.24s)]
*  casino. The market is like a casino. I mean, it is a better place to go. It is not a guaranteed [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=102.12s)]
*  source of income. It can go up and it can go down and we have volatility right now in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=111.28s)]
*  our economy. So hold the line. Like hold. Don't panic. Do not panic. That's actually [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=116.16000000000001s)]
*  what Trump is saying this morning. Don't panic. So we're going to talk about what's happening [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=124.64s)]
*  because these tariffs are having a greater effect on our market at least. And we'll see what they [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=128.84s)]
*  do to our economy. But boy, he is getting such pushback now from establishment Republicans, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=135.07999999999998s)]
*  the ones who didn't really want him. I mean, like I'll look, Elon's not a fan of the tariffs [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=140.64s)]
*  from what we're gleaning on Twitter, but Cora Maga so far seems to be still in Trump's corner. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=146.76s)]
*  Establishment Republicans like the journal. They don't like the tariffs. We knew that. They also [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=151.79999999999998s)]
*  don't like the immigration reforms. We knew that. They also didn't want Trump. They wanted Nikki [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=158.32s)]
*  Haley. We knew that. And Democrats who just want to hate Trump to hate him, they're all against him. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=162.92s)]
*  But what can we just hold on? Just hold on and don't let these Wall Street hot shots who live [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=169.0s)]
*  and die by a two point market move dictate the wisdom of Trump's tariffs, which are a longer [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=179.6s)]
*  term strategy. Look, President Trump is far from panicking. He posted this morning on Truth Social [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=186.2s)]
*  Quote, the US has a chance to do something that should have been done decades ago. Don't be weak. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=193.04s)]
*  Don't be stupid. Don't be a panicking. It appears to be a new party name he's thrown out there. Oh, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=198.04s)]
*  yeah. In fact, the follow up line is a new party based on weak and stupid people. Be strong, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=204.67999999999998s)]
*  courageous, and patient and greatness will be the result. So you heard it from the president. Don't [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=210.12s)]
*  be a panicking, a panicking. We're going to get into it plus more of our exclusive reporting on [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=214.96s)]
*  the Nashville school shooters journals, which we broke exclusively this morning on AM update, [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=220.68s)]
*  which you should check later today after this show. I just want to tell you what happened there. We [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=226.76000000000002s)]
*  received an exclusive on the Nashville shooters manifesto from the FBI. We exclusively had [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=232.76000000000002s)]
*  permission to report on it, though not to post the documents. And we spent the weekend reviewing [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=241.56s)]
*  the over 1000 of them. What we concluded, and it's outlined in morning update, which is on YouTube [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=247.12s)]
*  and on our podcast feed, is that we were misled by Nashville authorities last week, who said, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=253.96s)]
*  there's not one document called the manifesto. So we're just going to tell you based on our reading [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=260.52s)]
*  of these thousand plus documents, what the motives here were. And guess what didn't make the dance? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=268.76s)]
*  The shooter's trans ideology at all, at all. So we read through the documents. And again, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=273.64s)]
*  we've been misled. This woman was obsessed with trying to trans herself, wanting to trans herself, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=281.88s)]
*  trans ideology. I mean, it was like reading a leftist playbook on race, gender and hatred for [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=289.88000000000005s)]
*  America. And now it's becoming really clear why this wasn't shared with us for two years. Well, [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=299.56s)]
*  we've seen it and we don't have the same agenda as the people making those decisions. And thanks to [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=305.64000000000004s)]
*  Cash Patel and his transparent efforts at the FBI, we will bring you the full report later today. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=312.6s)]
*  We begin today with Victor Davis Hansen. He's a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution and [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=318.52s)]
*  author of the book, The End of Everything, How Wars Descend into Annihilation. Don't miss a moment. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=323.08s)]
*  Subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. These days, personal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=330.52s)]
*  safety isn't something that can be left to chance. Whether at home, on the road or just living [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=336.84s)]
*  everyday life, having a reliable way to protect yourself and your family is crucial. That's why [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=340.76s)]
*  Berna is the choice for many. Berna is a game changing, less lethal self-defense tool, compact, [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=345.32s)]
*  powerful and easy to use. It provides the confidence to act in any situation. Berna uses [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=351.08s)]
*  non-lethal rounds, tear gas, pepper and kinetic projectiles to effectively stop a threat from a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=356.28s)]
*  safe distance. And the best part, Berna can be shipped directly right to your door and it's [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=362.44s)]
*  legal in all 50 states. Berna is proudly American with products hand assembled in Fort Wayne, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=367.8s)]
*  Indiana. Sometimes a firearm is not the right option and Berna provides a powerful alternative. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=373.08s)]
*  Protect what matters most with Berna. Visit byrna.com, berna.com slash Megan to receive a 10% [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  discount and learn why thousands of people and law enforcement agencies are adding Berna's less [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=387.56s)]
*  lethal protection. Berna, non-lethal self-defense, always ready. VDH, welcome back. The meltdown [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=393.32s)]
*  on the establishment right and the Trump hating left over the volatility caused by Trump's change [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=403.24s)]
*  in tariffs is everywhere. Good luck tuning into a podcast, a television show, picking up a paper [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=410.52s)]
*  without being told how terrible these decisions are and how Trump doesn't know what he's doing. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=420.68s)]
*  You actively have to work to find somebody like you who says, let me tell you another way of [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=428.28s)]
*  looking at this and try to disabuse some of these establishment types of their very, very well held [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=435.79999999999995s)]
*  wisdom. So VDH, your thoughts on the tariffs. Well, there is a lot of misinformation. The first [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=442.67999999999995s)]
*  thing is that I know this, I'm like you, I have a 401k and it's been really hurt, but [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=449.0s)]
*  Donald Trump did everything Wall Street wanted his first term. He repealed Dodd-Frank, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=457.96s)]
*  he deregulated, he cut taxes, he encouraged accelerated depreciation and the market went up, [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=464.36s)]
*  Megan, 65% under Donald Trump, higher than even Biden, even though that he suffered through the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=474.28s)]
*  COVID. So I was looking at the Dow when it's 37 or 38,000, it's pretty much where Biden was in 2023. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=480.67999999999995s)]
*  And over the Biden and Trump eight years, it's gone up 100%. It's gone from 19, 1800 when Trump [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=491.55999999999995s)]
*  first entered office up to 38, low point. But if you look at wages, and this is what it's all about, [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=499.48s)]
*  even though the productivity over the last 50 years has almost doubled per worker, wages only [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=506.84000000000003s)]
*  went up 35%. Now, as far as the psychodrama goes, I, I'm, you and I are elites and we understand that, [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=514.04s)]
*  but 10% of the country owns 93% of the value of the stock market. 50% are only invested at 1%. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=521.4s)]
*  So a lot of this paranoia is that these people are not making over a 10 year period what they [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=531.88s)]
*  think they deserve. In other words, their portfolios over the last decade went up by 80% and no longer [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=539.48s)]
*  at this particular point have doubled into 100%. But they're not interested on the people below [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=546.36s)]
*  who would have dreamed of having wage returns to be comparable to the stock market. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=552.52s)]
*  The other thing is, and I don't understand this, that don't, they are not offering any constructive [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=559.8000000000001s)]
*  alternative. I keep thinking, well, maybe the left, I remember Bernie Sanders and Nancy Pelosi, [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=570.2s)]
*  said that China was, our policy toward China was a job loser. I remember Paul Krugman said he was [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=576.92s)]
*  a mercantilist. I can remember Warren Buffett writing that we are being wiped out by, that was [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=582.28s)]
*  20 years ago by asymmetrical trade. So I'm waiting for all these voices to come up and say, no, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=589.32s)]
*  this is what we should do to address the $1 trillion annual trade deficit or the trade [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=596.12s)]
*  deficits that have been, without exception, continuous since, what, 1975 or half century? [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=601.96s)]
*  They can either say, well, you know, trade deficits don't matter and I'll tell you why. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=609.8000000000001s)]
*  Or here's a better way of doing it. Or yes, we're paying $3 billion a day in interest on [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=613.96s)]
*  the national debt, but here's what I would do. Or here's how I'm going to get to, they don't do any [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=618.9200000000001s)]
*  of that, especially the left. So it's just, and then when you look at the whole totality of the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=622.36s)]
*  Trump 80 days, it's, well, we went from 10,000 a day to zero on the border. Nobody said that was [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=629.72s)]
*  possible. We've already identified $150 billion that everybody on both sides admits is probably [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=638.28s)]
*  waste and fraud already. For the first time in a decade, you can navigate through the Red Sea. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=644.36s)]
*  The Houthis are pretty much in withdrawal. Iran is completely emasculated and somebody is talking [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=651.0s)]
*  about ending the Ukraine war, which instead of just, we'll give them whatever it takes to the end. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=657.96s)]
*  So there's been dramatic changes that there are no, there's no appreciation. And you know, [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=663.96s)]
*  one last thing, I think workers understand that even if they don't buy stock in the company in [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=669.5600000000001s)]
*  which they work, the stock market is important. Donald Trump used to brag that he was, he had [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=675.0s)]
*  raised it 60% his first time and people said, oh, the stock market, that's not a good barometer, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=680.6800000000001s)]
*  workers wages and unemployment. But Donald Trump already had provided this week, you think the stock [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=684.92s)]
*  market would take note, 100,000 more jobs and the government said would be produced. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=692.12s)]
*  And the interest rate at an annual rate, maybe at this month is about two, 5%. And so he's getting [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=697.4s)]
*  to some data. And then you think, well, given this hysteria by the 10% in the media and academia and [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=704.92s)]
*  politics and the corporate world, he's done for. And then you'd look at the Harvard Harris poll, [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=711.56s)]
*  and he's still 49, 46 down a point or two. So I guess what I'm saying is I'm not this for me, [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=716.52s)]
*  I like to do exactly what you said, take a take a deep breath and then contextualize this with [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=726.1199999999999s)]
*  the Russian collusion hoax that we all said was a fake and we're not disbelieve the COVID lockdown [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=732.5999999999999s)]
*  debacle, the 100 laptop disinformation fable, the lie that Joe Biden was fit as a fiddle, [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=738.84s)]
*  the idea that Kamala Harris had closed the distance and she was three points ahead in [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=745.72s)]
*  Iowa and going to win that. And these all were these psychodramas that turned out to be [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=750.84s)]
*  not what they were. So and finally, one last rant, that they keep talking about tariffs, [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=756.76s)]
*  tariffs, tariffs, recession, depression, I can't think of a tariff that caused a major recession [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=762.6800000000001s)]
*  of depression. It didn't cause a 2008. That was Wall Street. That was this reckless Wall Street [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=767.88s)]
*  hysteria that we're seeing now only channeled into subprime mortgage securitization in the market [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=773.72s)]
*  when there wasn't capital there that they said there was. The smoot Harley Lack did not cause [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=780.12s)]
*  a great depression. We had a surplus at the time. It was unnecessary. Yes, it was punitive. Yes, [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=786.36s)]
*  but it was two years after when it fully was implemented. It was two years after [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=793.24s)]
*  what who caused the great depression buying on the margin and reckless Wall Street [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=798.52s)]
*  investors. So it's kind of ironic that Wall Street has a tendency to go bananas, speculate and hurt [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=805.4s)]
*  the rest of us. And now they're trying to cite smoot Harley that had nothing to do with the [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=812.52s)]
*  depression and they should look to themselves. And the final thing is that they think there's [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=817.48s)]
*  going to be help from the Democrats on deregulation, tax reduction, investment, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=822.04s)]
*  protecting American companies, dealing with the debt, dealing with the deficit. I don't think [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=830.04s)]
*  there is. Nothing's coming out of the left. Everything that's coming out of the left is [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=835.56s)]
*  antithetical to what the Wall Street Journal, for example, believes. So I just would like to [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=839.24s)]
*  hear what their alternative scenario is. Donald Trump's communication, I would only suggest to [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=844.1999999999999s)]
*  them that he have a tragic tone. He should instead of saying beautiful tariffs and we're [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=850.6s)]
*  going to make them pay or Europe has been ripping us off or repertory, he should say, you know, [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=856.6s)]
*  I didn't want to do this, but we've had 50 years of this and nobody draw anybody's attention to [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=861.32s)]
*  it. They offshoring, they outsourcing that has destroyed the industrial base of this country. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=867.48s)]
*  I don't like cutting federal workers, but who had ever cared about the $37 trillion debt? [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=873.8s)]
*  Who cares about the $3 billion in interest per day? I was tasked to do this in a way that nobody [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=881.9599999999999s)]
*  else has addressed it. I don't like doing it, but I'm going to do it for the good of the country, [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=887.88s)]
*  even though I'm going to be hated for doing it. If he said that, I think it'd be the other thing [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=892.52s)]
*  he could say is he's got to talk, cease all the talk about repertory tariffs where he says, [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=896.28s)]
*  well, we're going to make them pay for all the stuff they did in the past. Or they manipulate [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=902.52s)]
*  the currency through, they use health and safety gimmicks to forbid import true. But for right now, [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=908.68s)]
*  at this moment, he's got to talk about reciprocity that American people will back him the whole way. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=915.4s)]
*  If he just says, I would like zero tariffs with partners and barring that I want our tariffs to [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=921.8s)]
*  be what their tariffs are and just stop all the talk about we're going to have a 10% on everybody [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=929.32s)]
*  regardless, or we're going to tear off Australia even though they have a trade deficit with us. [[00:15:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=934.6s)]
*  He can get in in the second round to the currency manipulation, the VAT tax, the scams that countries [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=938.9200000000001s)]
*  use to say your products aren't clean enough or they may have disease, all of that. But for right [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=946.2800000000001s)]
*  now, the American people just want to be do unto others as they do to us. And they will back him [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=952.0400000000001s)]
*  to the end of the earth. When he makes the argument, I am just let it's on autopilot. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=957.96s)]
*  The fate is in these people's hands. If China wants to be happy, then just do [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=963.96s)]
*  tariff what we do or I'll go with them on zero tariff. That's a winning argument, but not well, [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=970.0400000000001s)]
*  Australia had a 19, you know, 2003 little quirk and they stopped beef. That's too intricate right [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=977.0s)]
*  now. Australia has basically zero tariffs. They want a deficit with us. We should not be [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=983.32s)]
*  terrifying them. The Chinese is that's a special case. And it's amazing like the disparity in terms [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=989.5600000000001s)]
*  of what they import to us versus what we import to them. And, you know, people are talking about, [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=999.0s)]
*  well, they Trump really added a lot of tariffs on them 37% on top of the pre existing tariffs [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1005.32s)]
*  that were already there under Trump 1.0 that Biden claimed to hate, but then kept in place. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1010.68s)]
*  And it affects virtually nothing because they don't buy from us. So like, it's almost just an [[00:16:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1016.76s)]
*  exercise and well, okay, it's like a thought exercise because compared to what we buy from them, [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1021.88s)]
*  they buy next to nothing from us. But today, they actually had the nerve to issue retaliatory tariff [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1026.9199999999998s)]
*  after Trump's 34%. And Trump just issued this statement on truth social. He writes, [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1034.8400000000001s)]
*  yesterday, China issued retaliatory tariffs of 34% on top of their already record setting tariffs, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1043.48s)]
*  non monetary tariffs, illegal subsidization of companies and massive long term currency [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1050.6000000000001s)]
*  manipulation. Despite my warning that any country that retaliates against the US by issuing additional [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1055.48s)]
*  tariffs above and beyond their already existing long term tariffs, a tariff abuse of our nation [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1060.76s)]
*  will be immediately met with new and substantially higher tariffs over and above those initially set. [[00:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1066.2s)]
*  Therefore, if China does not withdraw its 34% increase above their already long term trading [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1072.52s)]
*  abuses by tomorrow, April 8 2025, the US will impose additional tariffs on China of 50% effective [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1077.96s)]
*  April 9. Additionally, all talks with China concerning their requested meetings with us [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1086.28s)]
*  will be terminated. Negotiations with other countries, which have also requested meetings [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1091.3999999999999s)]
*  will begin taking place immediately. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1096.12s)]
*  So let's talk about China because, you know, the general thinking seems to be what's going to happen [[00:18:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1100.92s)]
*  in North America is ultimately going to be done by deal between Trump, Canada and Mexico, that, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1106.2s)]
*  you know, he already struck a deal with them first time around. And they'll probably strike [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1112.68s)]
*  another deal because we're all on the same continent. And we have an interest in having [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1117.48s)]
*  healthy trading relationships with our upstairs and downstairs neighbors. [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1121.48s)]
*  Then there's Europe, which now is, you know, acting as a block some 27 countries. And I think the [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1124.92s)]
*  general wisdom is that we'll reach a deal with them to some sort of a deal like maybe this is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1130.44s)]
*  a negotiation to hit something better. So it's really about Asia, these tariffs are about a large [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1135.3200000000002s)]
*  part about Asia and China, the number one where there's this huge disparity. And then when we hit [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1139.8s)]
*  them with tariffs last time around, they outsourced a lot of their manufacturing to some of these other [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1145.24s)]
*  Asian countries like Vietnam. We're like, Oh, okay, I'm gonna have to do it here. China said, [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1150.9199999999998s)]
*  we'll do it in Vietnam. They're not subject to the new increased tariffs on us. So now Trump has [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1155.08s)]
*  included Vietnam and all these smaller Asian countries in his net. So I don't think it's any [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1160.04s)]
*  accident that he's making an example out of China with his truth social post, Victor. And I, [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1166.92s)]
*  I think he's right on because I think Americans understand on an inherent level [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1175.5600000000002s)]
*  that everything we buy was made in China. You can't avoid it. If you try your, you know, from food [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1180.76s)]
*  to toys to clothes, the electronics, you name it, they make it there. They export it to the America [[00:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1190.28s)]
*  to America and we pay through the nose for it. And now Trump's trying to write that balance by [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1199.48s)]
*  bringing American manufacturing back and decreasing our dependence on this country that hates us. [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1205.96s)]
*  Your thoughts on Asia and China and how that all plays in here. [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1213.3999999999999s)]
*  Well, traditionally in these trade wars, the country that is running a big surplus is more [[00:20:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1216.92s)]
*  vulnerable because their industry and their economy has been geared geared toward mercantile [[00:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1222.2s)]
*  isom. And that's true, especially of China. The second thing is there's going to be a lot [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1227.6399999999999s)]
*  of opportunistic countries, Vietnam in particular, that are going to come to us and say, [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1233.72s)]
*  we can do what China is doing to you and we will give you a better deal. We'll have reciprocal [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1238.92s)]
*  tariffs with you. But if you go after China, we're here and they're going to pop up. It's [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1244.76s)]
*  kind of like musical chairs. If the music goes off, everybody wants a chair. Once he starts [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1249.96s)]
*  to do these deals, a lot of countries will say, if I don't cut a deal with them, I'll be the last one [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1254.76s)]
*  to get into the American market. And so China is vulnerable in that aspect. They also have 300,000 [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1260.04s)]
*  students here. We don't have hardly any there. They are buying hundreds of thousands of farmland [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1266.8400000000001s)]
*  in strategically located places. The FBI CIA has estimated that 1% and that was very generous of [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1273.4s)]
*  students and people from China on green cards are actively engaged in espionage. That could be three [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1282.2s)]
*  or 4,000 people. So my point is this is that they see us as naive and as right for exploitation [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1288.52s)]
*  and 360 degree thinking. If Trump gets into a tiff with him as he is now, he has all sorts [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1297.48s)]
*  of levers. He could say to China tomorrow, we're restricting the number of Chinese students that [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1306.28s)]
*  are coming to the United States by a hundred thousand. They would go ballistic and so would [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1311.72s)]
*  the universities who are using those and charging them 110% as a way of cash to subsidize a lot of [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1316.1200000000001s)]
*  the things they shouldn't be doing. So he could say that tomorrow that the Chinese cannot buy [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1322.84s)]
*  land in the United States, especially farmland within a vicinity of a military base. He could [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1329.24s)]
*  really clamp down on patent, copyright theft, military exchanges. Some of our allies [[00:22:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1335.3999999999999s)]
*  have exchanges with China, which they appropriate American technology. So [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1343.8s)]
*  they think that we are completely dependent on them and we are in the short term, but on the [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1348.12s)]
*  long term, their entire growth has been predicated on American magnanimity and they know that. [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1353.72s)]
*  And you know, getting back to Wall Street, we were told we were sold this Megan by the [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1360.84s)]
*  Clinton administration, the George Bush administration, the Obama administration, [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1365.8s)]
*  that the more laxity and deference that you gave China, the more that they would rack up [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1371.32s)]
*  surpluses, become affluent, create a middle-class consumer class, get plugged in globalization, [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1378.12s)]
*  have their students in Western universities. Then they would liberalize and then they would [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1384.4399999999998s)]
*  become a constitutional society and join the family of nations. That never happened. They used [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1389.1599999999999s)]
*  this asymmetrical relationship with Europe and us to make a lot of money, to build a lot of weapons, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1394.36s)]
*  to bully their enemies and create the Silk Road, Belt and Road mercantile empire. And all is a way [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1400.68s)]
*  of dethroning the United States. So they have no goodwill among Americans and they're much more [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1410.44s)]
*  vulnerable than everybody thinks. We were watching, you know, the usual suspects for the most part [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1416.44s)]
*  beat up on Trump. There are a few outliers, but what I am gleaning is that some of the people who [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1424.92s)]
*  are defecting from Trump on this plan or just giving him time to see how it works are people [[00:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1431.0800000000002s)]
*  who are extremely heavily invested in the market. You know, it's like, okay, I get it. You're not [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1436.52s)]
*  his priority right now. He wants you to benefit too eventually, but right now he's doing something [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1443.4s)]
*  that he thinks long term could help the bottom half of the country. But they're not used to [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1449.72s)]
*  that, Victor. You know, following Bill Ackman's ex feed and he actually, he had a post about you [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1455.64s)]
*  tweeting directly to you saying you made a compelling case for the terror strategy, [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1464.44s)]
*  but that you had one issue incorrect. He claimed that the Trump, he describes the Trump terrorist [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1468.92s)]
*  as reciprocal and proportional to these other nations and what they've assessed on us. In [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1473.72s)]
*  actuality, the Trump tariffs were set at levels substantially above and in many cases at a multiple [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1478.52s)]
*  of the counterparty countries, tariff levels and goes on as Bill Ackman tends to do with a very, [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1483.32s)]
*  very long post. Yeah, I don't, I don't think it's, it's the way you calibrate whether it's [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1488.44s)]
*  reciprocal or not. So I think that most of them are reciprocal. Well, I know what you mean because, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1493.16s)]
*  I mean, there are some countries who they don't have a tariff on our goods necessarily, [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1498.28s)]
*  but we're just not allowed to sell our cars there. They've, they've created such a, like a green scheme [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1502.44s)]
*  that keeps us out that it's might as well have a hundred percent tariff. You know, we, we, I can [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1506.84s)]
*  tell you from agriculture, we dip chickens because we don't want people putting a whole chicken on [[00:25:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1513.1599999999999s)]
*  the counter for more than 24 hours. So we dip them in chlorine tinge water. European does not want, [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1519.32s)]
*  Europe's don't, what they say, oh, we're going to make a law of chlorine is too deadly. Or the [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1524.76s)]
*  Australians say in 2003, one Canadian cow came across the border with mad cows. So we're going [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1529.08s)]
*  to ban all beef. And they did until 2019. And then even after that, they made it difficult. [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1535.56s)]
*  All of that we can do in a round two, but I do think it's a parody. I live in a very poor community. [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1540.6799999999998s)]
*  And when I go to the supermarket, people will come up and talk, mostly Mexican American people. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1547.96s)]
*  And I can tell you that not one person the last week has mentioned the stock market. [[00:25:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1553.0s)]
*  All they have talked about is trade, trade and jobs, jobs, jobs. And these are the 50% [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1557.72s)]
*  who account for 1% 50% of the country that accounts for 1% of the market capitalization [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1564.92s)]
*  value in, in wall street. But that's not the people who are reporting. That's not the people [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1571.3200000000002s)]
*  who are weighing in. That's not the people who, and I think people, you know, and when you say reps, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1576.3600000000001s)]
*  when they say reciprocity, that's what I was getting to earlier. The first thing they'll say [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1583.4s)]
*  is that they would say, I talked to four or five people and they said, is it true that Mexico has [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1587.3200000000002s)]
*  170 billion trades? That's not fair. Is it true that Canada has 101? Yes. That's all people care [[00:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1592.9199999999998s)]
*  about. They don't want to have inordinate. They don't want to be the bully. They do. They would [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1600.28s)]
*  either like zero tariffs or tit for tat. And if Trump can stick to that, he will not only get a [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1603.9599999999998s)]
*  lot of foreign investment and change of attitude, but he will get the overwhelming support of the [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1609.8799999999999s)]
*  American people. But if he gets into all of this stuff that we just talked about, which is valid [[00:26:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1615.9599999999998s)]
*  and legitimate, but if he does it in round one, then people are going to come. Well, Trump's, [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1621.24s)]
*  I think the wall street journal runs almost every day. Trump is lying and not reciprocal or that is [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1626.44s)]
*  a losing argument at this stage. Well, just to finish the point on bill. So then by, by Sunday [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1631.8s)]
*  at 5pm, he called for a 90 day pause in the tariffs. So first he was, okay, I disagree with [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1638.76s)]
*  Victor a little, a little, but he said we have to help Trump succeed is the least we can do. [[00:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1643.32s)]
*  Then by Sunday at 5pm, the earlier exchange was Saturday. He called for a 90 day pause. We've got [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1648.5200000000002s)]
*  to pause it. We've got to pause it. The president's losing the confidence of business leaders around [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1655.96s)]
*  the globe. This is not what we voted for. Got to call a timeout. Then he followed up by saying, [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1660.2800000000002s)]
*  if you haven't noticed by now, I speak the truth, regardless of the consequences to me personally, [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1666.1200000000001s)]
*  or what other people think. Then by Sunday night, he was taking shots at Howard Lutnick saying, [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1669.64s)]
*  I just figured out why he's indifferent to the stock market and the economy crashing. He and [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1675.16s)]
*  Kenner Fitzgerald, which he runs are long bonds, meaning they profit when the economy implodes. [[00:27:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1678.8400000000001s)]
*  It's a bad idea to pick a secretary of commerce whose firm has leveraged long fixed income and [[00:28:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1684.2s)]
*  irreconcilable conflict of interest. By Monday morning, he was saying he had been unfair to [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1689.16s)]
*  Howard Lutnick. I don't think he's pursuing his self interest. I'm sure he's doing the best he can [[00:28:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1694.0400000000002s)]
*  for the country. I'm just frustrated watching what I believe to be a major policy error. Okay. So [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1698.76s)]
*  with all due respect to Bill, I've seen this from quite a few very heavily invested people. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1704.1200000000001s)]
*  They're against this because they're watching their own fortune or the fortune of their company [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1710.92s)]
*  go up and down precipitously. They see these massive falls and they want to stop it. I get [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1716.28s)]
*  that. But of course, waiting it out long term and letting things settle is what every investment [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1722.76s)]
*  advisor tells you to do. But separate and apart from that, they don't understand that this isn't [[00:28:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1728.68s)]
*  about helping the Bill Ackmans of the world. It just isn't. And Republicans in particular are used [[00:28:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1736.6000000000001s)]
*  to a president who is devoted to helping their pocketbooks. It goes back to the wisdom of my [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1742.44s)]
*  Nana who lived to be 101. And when she saw I was working at Fox News and I was saying certain [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1749.96s)]
*  things on certain policies and starting to sound more right wing, she said, [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1756.12s)]
*  Republicans. She goes, Republicans are for the rich. We're not rich. We're Democrats. [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1761.08s)]
*  Right? That was my Nana's wisdom born in 1915 and she wasn't wrong. And I think there's still a very [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1768.1999999999998s)]
*  large portion of the party that is used to that being the basic approach when their president- [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1774.6799999999998s)]
*  I grew up in a Democratic. All my siblings are Democrats. And what I was told was [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1782.12s)]
*  the Republicans, all they care about are capital gains, tax and privatizing social security. [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1789.0s)]
*  That's what I was told. And Trump comes along and for the first time, it's not what he said, [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1794.04s)]
*  it's what he did. He recaptured the middle class. You look at every statistic data point from the [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1800.76s)]
*  2024 election. He redefined American politics. The Democrats are the party of the professional [[00:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1806.12s)]
*  and wealthy and the subsidized poor. And he just, he wiped out the Democrats in middle-class voting. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1815.8s)]
*  And this is the reason why. And that's why he hasn't really, he hasn't taken a Wall Street hit [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1822.6s)]
*  of the same magnitude in his polls. Because as I said, 50% of the people have 1% of the [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1829.8799999999999s)]
*  value of the market. Well, on that point, on that point, here's, let me just play this sound bite. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1835.8s)]
*  It's Scott Besson, our treasury secretary, who sat down with Tucker last week and spoke to that a bit. [[00:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1840.04s)]
*  Here it is. We have President Trump's previous term when everyone said none of this was going to work. [[00:30:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1844.9199999999998s)]
*  Oh, the China terrorists are going to do this. They're going to cause inflation. They didn't. [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1851.08s)]
*  This is going to happen to working- it's going to be bad for working-class Americans. Well, guess [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1856.28s)]
*  what? Working-class Americans, the hourly workers did better than supervisory workers. [[00:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1861.64s)]
*  The bottom 50% of households, their net worth increased faster than the top 10% of households. [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1868.1200000000001s)]
*  And look, I'm not happy with what's going on in the market today, but the distribution of [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1875.96s)]
*  equities across households, the top 10% of Americans own 88% of equities, 88% of the stock [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1883.24s)]
*  market. The next 40% owns 12% of the stock market. The bottom 50% has debt. They have credit card [[00:31:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1891.32s)]
*  bills. They rent their homes. They have auto loans and we've got to give them some relief. [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1901.0s)]
*  And that top 10%, Victor, as you know, includes all of the Acela media, all these anchors on CNN, [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1908.9199999999998s)]
*  all these op-ed writers for the Wall Street Journal. Those are in the 88%. They are the [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1916.36s)]
*  ones who own the market. Yeah. And because they're running around like a chicken with [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1922.6s)]
*  their head cut off and somebody who lived on a farm, I mean, chickens really do run off. [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1929.08s)]
*  It's something to see. Oh, boy. [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1933.0s)]
*  And this is why I use that metaphor because they remind me of when my Swedish grandfather would say, [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1936.28s)]
*  cut the chicken's head off and then see this thing flop around. [[00:32:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1941.8s)]
*  Oh, my God. And that's what they're, yeah. They've lost their mind is what I'm saying. [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1946.12s)]
*  And if they would just take a deep breath and they would just say, hey, job growth shocked [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1952.36s)]
*  everybody. It was up 100,000 jobs that they said would not happen. The inflation rate is looking [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1958.28s)]
*  good. Oil prices are down. Energy are down 10%. On the foreign market, it looks like Iran is not [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1964.6s)]
*  going to be the disruptor that everybody said would happen. It looks like there is some pathway [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1975.0s)]
*  to Ukraine, a ceasefire. It looks like the Red Sea is navigable again. It looks like the southern [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1981.0s)]
*  border is calm. It looks like we can deal with Canada and Mexico, even though they have these [[00:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1986.92s)]
*  surpluses with us. It looks like if you look at Trump, what he's talking, extending tax cuts, [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1993.48s)]
*  deregulate. It looks like the first term in which the market went up 60%. If they would just look at [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=1999.0s)]
*  that and calm down, I think, I don't know what they're trying to do if they're trying to do a [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2006.1999999999998s)]
*  2008 or 1929 psychological meltdown, but they look ridiculous. They look ridiculous. And you [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2012.52s)]
*  know what's going to happen if Trump cuts all of these deals and this investment, and you and I [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2020.6s)]
*  have this same conversation nine months from now, and there's four trillion investment, [[00:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2025.8799999999999s)]
*  then they're going to say I was with Trump the whole way. I tried to calm people. It reminds me [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2030.9199999999998s)]
*  so much of all the people that swore that Christopher Steele was a genius or the laptop, [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2036.28s)]
*  they just knew it was cooked up in a Moscow headquarters or that Joe Biden was fit in a fiddle, [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2044.04s)]
*  Joe Scarborough. I've seen this guy. He's never been better. And I got a call on election night [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2051.4s)]

*  reliable. He is down three point. If he's down in a red state like Iowa, he's lost. And I said, [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2066.7599999999998s)]
*  this is bogus. He won that state by 12 points. So that class of this elite that owns stock, [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2072.92s)]
*  it's synonymous also with the people who follow every breath in the media and academia and the [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2083.64s)]
*  corporate boardroom and the legal community. But they're not Americans. Not like most Americans, [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2090.84s)]
*  is what I mean to say. The majority of Americans don't think like they do. [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2099.32s)]
*  And I'm not making fun of them. I'm just saying they get touchy, they get edgy, they get impulse. [[00:35:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2103.4s)]
*  I don't know what the word is, but I drive over to the coast each week on the Stanford campus. [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2112.52s)]

*  Central Valley, it's like, wow, I just went to Mars and I'm now back on earth, because they're [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2125.72s)]
*  not representative. I know what you mean. No, I think about it all the time because now, of course, [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2132.12s)]
*  I've been in media for a long time and we have some nice trappings surrounding us as a family. [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2138.3599999999997s)]
*  But we used to live in this three bedroom duplex that was in an okay area of town in this small [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2144.6s)]
*  little town in Westchester. A one car garage was fine. I'm not saying we were poor, but we [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2153.96s)]
*  didn't have a lot of money, that's for sure. And we were absolutely happy. We were so happy as a [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2161.8s)]
*  family. And we drive by that all the time. And our kids remember living in that house when they were [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2167.08s)]
*  toddlers. And I always say, you remember what life was like there. You don't need all this money. [[00:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2173.08s)]
*  You don't need a swimming pool. You don't need this stuff in order to live a really happy life. [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2178.7599999999998s)]
*  You need family, you need friends. You need something ideally that occupies your time on a [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2184.04s)]
*  daily basis that makes you feel like you're contributing to society. But I can't help but [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2188.44s)]
*  feel that there's an underlying missing value here in the rush to condemn his plan by the so-called [[00:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2194.6s)]
*  elites. It's like, could you just hold on and come to terms with a moment? What if you did have [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2202.52s)]
*  a massive wipeout on Wall Street that didn't rebound? I don't believe for a minute that Trump [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2209.8s)]
*  will leave it there. He too loves wealth. He loves wealth. He loves rich people. He surrounds himself [[00:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2214.2s)]
*  with rich people because he so admires them. There's no way he's going to tell the rich base, [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2220.12s)]
*  you're screwed. But let's just imagine a world in which they do get a little screwed and they [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2225.96s)]
*  actually lose a fair amount of money and the lower half of the country rises up. I just think [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2232.04s)]
*  there's this piece of the people covering this, the ones who are having the meltdowns that cannot [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2237.72s)]
*  imagine a life without their immense wealth. I can give you examples. I live in a 150-year-old [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2243.16s)]
*  house that was falling apart. So I had people work on it to read. So Juan was one of the [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2254.2s)]
*  electricians. He had long COVID. He could hardly walk. I said, Juan, how long have you been working? [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2260.28s)]
*  He said, I never took a day off. I can't. He was a genius when you looked at this old house, [[00:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2264.2000000000003s)]
*  how he figured out circuit panels and everything. And then there was Jose and he was a painter. And [[00:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2270.44s)]
*  I said, you don't look good today. He said, I have a kidney infection. I have to go up for injections [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2275.6400000000003s)]

*  He said, what's my alternative? And he said, I have a mortgage on my house. I have car payments. [[00:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2287.24s)]
*  California, I can't even afford $5.50 for diesel. That's what everybody goes through. And they're [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2294.9199999999996s)]

*  when whole towns were wiped out. They didn't care because they were offshoring and outsourcing and [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2307.3199999999997s)]

*  said, oh my God, the market is not 280 million Americans. For my skills, there's 7 billion [[00:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2326.0400000000004s)]

*  manufacture, farm, mineral, whatever, well, we have a special vocabulary for them. As Joe Biden said, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2344.9199999999996s)]
*  you go down on a mine, we close it, you'll learn how to code or program. He'll read, oh, you know, [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2352.6s)]
*  calls off it. You know, we're going to put you in the mine out of business. Okay. And then we had [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2358.2s)]
*  that language of disparagement for the same people, but now they were tagged with Trump. They were [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2363.0s)]
*  deplorable. They were irredeemable. For Obama, they were clingers. For Biden, they were chumps. [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2368.36s)]
*  They were dregs and garbage. So that's who they are. And I'm not just saying this to say it's okay [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2375.48s)]
*  to see the market go down. I think the market is going to settle down. I think it's going to [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2383.8s)]
*  digest this. And if these countries start to come in and think, I got to come in before I'm the left [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2391.2400000000002s)]
*  out, and Trump is wise enough to take the deal that results in either a no tariff or semi [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2397.8s)]
*  reciprocal and not worry, as I said earlier, about the past or and then just says, we're going to [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2406.1200000000003s)]
*  discuss the issue about health or gimmicks and that later. This economy is going to take off. [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2411.8s)]
*  I think interest rates are already going to go down. And he's going to Trump's pushing for that. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2418.6000000000004s)]
*  He's going to it's going to be my only worry is that there's going to be something like a Chinese [[00:40:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2423.7999999999997s)]
*  bio weapon or COVID 2.0 or something. But I think he's got enough people around him that are [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2429.72s)]
*  brilliant. And they are determined and they're they're addressing all at once, budget deficits, [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2436.68s)]
*  trade deficits, long term debt. And it's something to watch. Here's a little bit of comfort for [[00:40:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2442.7599999999998s)]
*  all the people who are part of the Assela media and the 1% and all that Trump, there were some [[00:40:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2451.7999999999997s)]
*  grumblings out of the Trump White House that he might raise taxes on the rich, or at least [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2458.04s)]
*  let them raise. In other words, when the Trump tax cuts expire later this year, he is expected [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2465.96s)]
*  through reconciliation to put them back into place for people. And there was some talk that maybe he [[00:41:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2472.2799999999997s)]
*  would exclude the richest Americans from that in order to pay for his no taxes on tips, [[00:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2477.64s)]
*  promise and his no taxes on Social Security promise. And I don't know whether that whether [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2483.24s)]
*  he's going to do that or not. But I would say if the market continues to bathe in uncertainty and [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2488.2799999999997s)]
*  volatility between now and then you have a much higher chance of Trump not letting your tax cuts [[00:41:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2493.64s)]
*  expire as a rich person because he's just not he's not going to completely thumb the middle finger [[00:41:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2500.3599999999997s)]
*  at the wealthier half of his base. He's just not. That's his whole family. It's every single [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2505.96s)]
*  friend he has. It's him and he hates taxes and he hates paying the government for things. So it's [[00:41:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2512.04s)]
*  like, just let's use our heads, take a deep breath, calm down. Okay. And that applies triple to the [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2517.96s)]
*  leftists, Victor, because not only are they lamenting what's happening with the stock market, [[00:42:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2525.32s)]
*  even though they were pro tariff their whole lives long, the left has been pro tariff for a [[00:42:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2530.36s)]
*  long, long time. There's a there's a Salvatore Nancy Pelosi from 1996 making the rounds. I don't [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2534.36s)]
*  know if you've seen it, but she's totally pro tariff. You're actually we have it. Here it is. [[00:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2538.2000000000003s)]
*  How far does China have to go? How much more repression? How big a trade deficit and [[00:42:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2542.84s)]
*  loss of jobs for the American worker and how much more dangerous proliferation has to exist [[00:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2551.0s)]
*  before members of this House of Representatives will say, I will not endorse the status quo. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2557.0s)]
*  Right now we have a $34 billion trade deficit with China, the 1995 figure, it will be over $40 [[00:42:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2563.32s)]
*  billion for 1996. That the average US MFM tariff on Chinese goods coming into the United States [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2571.8s)]
*  is 2%. Whereas the average Chinese MFM tariff on US goods going into China is 35%. Is that reciprocal? [[00:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2578.44s)]
*  The US allows China to flood our markets with 30 a third of their exports. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2588.68s)]
*  By the way, so she said it was a $34 billion trade deficit then now it's like 250 billion. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2596.2799999999997s)]
*  I think Trump should really call her up and ask if he can hire her and she can do that again and [[00:43:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2602.7599999999998s)]
*  update it. She can really explain to people. Yeah, I just read this. Suddenly, Richter, [[00:43:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2608.68s)]
*  they're all about free trade, the left suddenly all about free trade. They don't like tariffs now. [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2614.04s)]
*  Because it's Trump's plan. And of course, they don't like Trump and they don't like Elon and [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2618.68s)]
*  they're having like severe meltdowns, coast to coast, not only in the protests that we saw over [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2624.2799999999997s)]

*  waste. No finding efficiencies, none of that. And then we get this, the Federalist producing a survey. [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2640.6s)]
*  It was done by the Network of Contagion Research Institute, NCRI in partnership with Rutgers [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2649.7999999999997s)]

*  They go on to say that this is about something more than just the desire to kill Trump. [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2664.8399999999997s)]

*  emergent assassination culture grounded in far left authoritarianism and increasingly normalized [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2684.04s)]
*  in digital discourse. The reports found widespread justification for lethal violence, [[00:44:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2692.04s)]
*  including assassination among younger, highly online, and ideologically left aligned users. [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2697.8s)]

*  when you have the President of the United States telling donors that they got to put a bullseye [[00:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2717.6400000000003s)]

*  right in the middle of all this hysteria, take Elon down, or even back earlier when [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2728.7599999999998s)]

*  recent act of violence, the ideological rannings such as they were of the two foiled assassins, [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2754.2s)]
*  plus the Steve Scalise shooting and the trans thing. You're getting the impression that [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2761.24s)]

*  terrified. They came out, they were armed, they went through the whole property. We have 40 acres. [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2820.52s)]
*  So you were swatted? [[00:47:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2827.16s)]
*  Yes. They were worried because somebody, they said it called up and said that there was an [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2828.8399999999997s)]

*  48% say they can see that it's at least somewhat justified to murder Elon Musk. 55% said the same [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2926.52s)]
*  about murdering president Trump. 55% of those who simply identify as left of center think it is [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2934.68s)]
*  somewhat justified to murder Donald Trump. 55%. That's sick. There's something deeply wrong. [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2943.32s)]
*  Inside the Democrat party. This is not how Republicans talked about Joe Biden. Certainly [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2953.4s)]
*  not 55% of the Republican party would be out there justifying murder. There's something wrong. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2958.1200000000003s)]
*  There's a sickness. There's a cancerous illness bubbling up inside of their party. [[00:49:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2966.84s)]
*  The assassination attempts on Trump, the burning of the Tesla facilities, the fire bombing of the [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2971.32s)]
*  charging stations. They're not one-offs. The praise of Luigi Mangione, Luigi Mangione. It's [[00:49:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2978.36s)]
*  all connected. There's a theme because it is thematic in describing the left today. [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2984.76s)]
*  I had to take a quick break. There's so much more with VDH and we'll pick it up right after this. [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2991.88s)]
*  The IRS is the largest collection agency in the world. And with April 15th fast approaching, [[00:49:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=2997.7200000000003s)]

*  If you owe back taxes or have unfiled returns, waiting is not an option. April 15th could mark [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3007.32s)]
*  another tax year that has passed you by. So the smart move is to get ahead of it now. But listen, [[00:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3013.2400000000002s)]
*  never contact the IRS alone. Instead, you could let the experts at Tax Network USA handle it for [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3018.92s)]
*  you. Why? Well, not all tax resolution companies are the same. Tax Network USA has a preferred [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3024.6800000000003s)]

*  Act now before the IRS acts first. On Friday night, we received more than 1,000 pages of [[00:51:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3062.52s)]
*  writings by the Nashville school shooter, chilling journals that local officials in Nashville did not [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3069.64s)]
*  want you to see. The FBI sent the files to the Megyn Kelly show as well as to Congress on the heels [[00:51:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3075.88s)]
*  of a report from the Metropolitan Nashville Police Department last week that was severely lacking. [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3082.2s)]
*  Our team reviewed the documents created by the perpetrator of the March 2023 shooting [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3089.48s)]
*  that tragically took the lives of three children and three adults. The three children were third [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3093.96s)]
*  graders, aged nine. The documents provide clear insight into the depraved mind of this killer, [[00:51:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3098.44s)]
*  critical context that was excluded from the 48-page report released last week, [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3104.44s)]
*  and that has been withheld from the public for two years. At one point about a year plus ago, [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3109.0s)]
*  Steven Crowder got his hands on three pages, which was great. It was something. Three pages [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3114.6s)]
*  out of a thousand they have been withholding for years, saying it's somehow too much for us to see. [[00:52:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3120.8399999999997s)]
*  We've seen every other shooter's manifesto, rantings, writings. Why not this one? [[00:52:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3127.0s)]
*  We here at the Megyn Kelly show do not name school shooters, but due to the nature of this news, [[00:52:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3134.68s)]
*  we will mention that the shooter's given birth first name is Audrey. However, in the years leading [[00:52:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3139.32s)]
*  up to the horrific act, she instead went by the name Aiden and used he, him pronouns. [[00:52:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3145.0s)]
*  On our AM update show this morning, that's another show we're doing now. It's a 15-minute [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3151.96s)]
*  news update for you in the mornings. You can get it on youtube.com slash Megyn Kelly or our podcast [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3155.6400000000003s)]
*  feed. We delved into some of the writings and we will continue here. We'll repeat a couple, [[00:52:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3159.7200000000003s)]
*  but we will add because the report from the Nashville police barely touched on the full [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3165.64s)]
*  scope and breadth of what was contained. The killers struggles with her gender, her obsession [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3170.68s)]
*  with gender identity, alarming racial animus toward herself as a white person and how those [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3178.2799999999997s)]
*  factors contributed to the act that she committed that day. Why do you think they excluded all of [[00:53:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3184.8399999999997s)]
*  this? Why are those two things too hot to touch? The families of the victims do not wish for this [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3190.6s)]
*  information to be made public. We understand that, but we are sharing a sampling of necessary context [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3197.96s)]
*  omitted by the Nashville police. And that has been hidden for far too long from the public. [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3205.16s)]
*  The public has a right to know as a matter of safety in preventing more of these. The FBI has [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3210.92s)]
*  given us permission to say what is written, but not to show the actual documents. The journals [[00:53:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3218.6s)]
*  contain many pages expressing the shooter's belief that she is a man and was born in quote, [[00:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3223.64s)]
*  the wrong body. In one entry dated April 12th, 2022, this is a year before the shooting titled, [[00:53:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3228.8399999999997s)]
*  let kids choose their sex. The killer writes quote, how dare God hand me a training bra [[00:53:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3235.48s)]
*  when I didn't know WTF it was as a kid. I hated it much more. I'd like to dispose my vagina. [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3241.56s)]
*  We should all choose our gender. And to keep in mind, as you hear just these samplings, [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3248.28s)]
*  I'm going to read you that what the Nashville police represented was that her trans ideology, [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3252.6800000000003s)]
*  her gender confusion had absolutely nothing to do with the horrific acts she took. Why? [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3258.6000000000004s)]
*  How do you glean that this stuff is all over her writings? She's clearly deeply disturbed by it, [[00:54:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3264.28s)]
*  but somehow that's the part you can excise from her motivation? Wrong. In another, she writes quote, [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3270.28s)]
*  how does it feel to grow up the gender you were born with and are comfortable and happy with? [[00:54:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3277.24s)]
*  Well, I don't know that feeling. I never did use senseless people that you don't know WTF [[00:54:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3281.7999999999997s)]
*  comes out of your mouth telling me I'm female. Female pronouns make me feel like I want to die, [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3286.68s)]
*  especially called woman. I never was ever. I hate being in a woman's body need to die, [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3291.7999999999997s)]
*  but it said nothing to do with the act she took at covenant school. In an entry, [[00:54:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3298.6s)]
*  marked June 6th, 2021, the killer writes quote, Eric and Dylan. That's a reference to the [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3303.64s)]
*  Columbine killers were gods. All those little dumb shits in other school shootings during the 1990s [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3308.2799999999997s)]
*  were not gods, just cowards. Even if maybe they had a reason, they left it a mystery. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3314.92s)]
*  I realized that after knowing Columbine, I immediately became attached to it. Not just [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3320.12s)]
*  the notorious outcome, but the preceding evidence leading up to it. I feel I am the reincarnation [[00:55:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3324.68s)]
*  of Dylan Klebold. My thoughts of depression are forever linked to his and my experience as well. [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3329.64s)]
*  In a diary entry shortly after that, the killer writes about how epic it would have been if she [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3335.48s)]
*  had shot up her own high school quote, kill all the white kids, kill my own race. F yes, destroy [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3340.12s)]
*  all the white people who are teachers. Let all the black kids go unless if I don't like you. [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3347.4s)]
*  About a month later, the killer writing several pages about why black pain is different from [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3353.0s)]
*  white pain. Black people were given fate given nothing. While white people get power in the [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3357.7200000000003s)]
*  White House have all the privileges even to white people like me. White people are born with [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3363.6400000000003s)]
*  privileges. Black people aren't. Black people always had to earn and fight for their needs and [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3368.1200000000003s)]
*  wants. It was like that in history. It's like that now. The killer goes on quote, being white sucks, [[00:56:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3372.44s)]
*  but being black is so cool. Black people should rule. White people should fall. [[00:56:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3378.28s)]
*  Every white person who lived and died. I hate you all. July of 2022. The killer writes about [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3382.76s)]
*  wanting another therapy session, but not having the money quote. I need to have another session [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3389.1600000000003s)]
*  with my therapist. I need her. It's been two months. I don't deny needing help. I loathe [[00:56:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3394.2000000000003s)]
*  the reality of my fate as an autistic dependent 27 year old later on in the journal three pages [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3399.6400000000003s)]
*  that appear to have been printed and affixed into the journal titled in all caps. I hate [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3407.16s)]
*  the American people. The killer writing America was doomed from the very beginning quote. [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3413.8799999999997s)]
*  America started with slavery and white people ruling land. Black people were objects and [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3419.24s)]
*  owned by white landowners and farmers from the start of July 4th 1776. There are no African [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3424.2s)]
*  American rights. Slavery is still happening. It goes on quote. Government agencies have all the [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3429.7999999999997s)]
*  freedom white people who want to take away instead of adding more. What do you call that? [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3435.64s)]
*  America is not the land of the free. It's a land full of idiots. It will only get worse in this [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=3440.6s)]

*  upgraded the charge to state treason so she's been slapped with this crazy charge of treason [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=5944.28s)]
*  she's just there to see her grandmother and she gets a russian lawyer which i imagine one has to [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=5951.4s)]
*  do in order to fight charges by the russian authorities and so how did that happen and did [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=5957.88s)]

*  it was very very difficult because first of all i'm dealing with the mother and father which are [[01:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=5977.08s)]
*  in russia and they want to be hands-on with with a lawyer they want to be able to see the lawyer in [[01:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=5981.32s)]

*  lawyer and i will tell you every lawyer turned us down because they said it's too risky they said [[01:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=5995.639999999999s)]
*  you're fighting in russia like we can lose our license and eventually we've we've got all of the [[01:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6002.44s)]

*  we like this lawyer we'll go with him anyway go with the lawyer long story short the lawyer [[01:40:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6024.04s)]
*  ended up telling him to plead guilty now i was very upset about that i was like why would you do that [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6030.28s)]
*  and he said look it's she's gonna get 20 years in prison i can get that down to five years if she [[01:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6036.2s)]

*  her to plead guilty and guess what she got the minimum of 12 it didn't work but it painted this [[01:40:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6050.599999999999s)]
*  picture of cassandra now acknowledging what she did and it made me very very upset this lawyer [[01:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6059.8s)]
*  as as as the time progressed in this whole battle we realized this lawyer is like a puppet to the [[01:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6068.76s)]
*  kids k gb just a puppet he's doing everything they want he made cassandra sign letters cassandra was [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6074.360000000001s)]

*  so the lawyer wasn't really representing her best interest the lawyer the lawyer no no no no what [[01:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6086.2s)]
*  was there any other evidence against her that they used or what did it all boil down to this 151 [[01:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ld8PKc63Hqw&t=6094.04s)]
