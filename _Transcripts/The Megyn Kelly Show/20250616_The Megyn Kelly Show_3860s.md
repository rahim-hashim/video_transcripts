*  here in studio with me to Caroline Levitt and Marco Rubio in Washington, D.C. Zachary Levi and [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=18.72s)]
*  I sat down together as did Dave Portnoy and yours truly in the Sirius XM headquarters in New York [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=25.6s)]
*  City. That was fun and great. It was very interesting. Zachary Levi, he's a big Hollywood [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=33.6s)]

*  This whole thing is about your journey with Emma. Yeah, trying to conceive a baby. Yeah. And I mean, [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=116.8s)]
*  no detail is spared. Yeah. But so it's very personal. It's unusually personal. Yeah. Yeah. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=121.68s)]
*  Did you did you run it by her first? So the thing was, is, yeah, first, like, you know, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=126.56s)]
*  this is the most like male thing. Like, but I assumed that the reason why we couldn't is [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=132.48000000000002s)]
*  because it was her fault. Right. And I talk about it in the special where I'm like, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=137.44s)]
*  she was really concerned it was her fault. And I was really concerned it was her fault. Like, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=141.28s)]
*  we were all really concerned. Obviously her fault. Yeah. Because like men, we have this like confidence [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=144.0s)]
*  in our sperm that like, there's no real reason why. But we just know, right? Like every time I've ever [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=148.56s)]
*  had sex with a girl, I was like, Oh, my God, this is going to be great. Like, what should we do? How [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=154.4s)]
*  do you calling the next month? I know she's pregnant guarantee, which I now know is a waste. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=158.32s)]
*  And once we found out that her ovaries were perfect, and my sperm was horrible. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=163.76s)]
*  It actually made it a lot easier for me to talk about. Really? Yeah. Because I think the reason [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=169.28s)]
*  why like anybody who has fertility issues, one, it's very isolating, because you're so protective [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  of the person that you love, that you don't a lot of women feel a lot of shame around. Yeah, true. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=179.44s)]
*  And at first, I felt like real shame. I was like, Does God not want me to have a child? Like I was [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=184.39999999999998s)]
*  like, I didn't understand it. Like, I think I'm like a pretty good person. And I'm kind to people. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=189.68s)]
*  And I'm like, Why is this happening? What the fuck is going on? And yes, I get that. And a lot [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=193.28s)]
*  of women, if they are struggling, they're just like, they feel like it's a, I don't feel very [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=198.96s)]
*  stigmatized. Right. And but once she was perfect, and I was fucked up, I could get on stage. And [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=203.84s)]
*  I was really cathartic to talk about it. And then once I started talking about it, I literally [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=210.08s)]
*  thought that I was like, this was like a one in like 10 million thing. Oh, wow. The same I started [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=215.44s)]
*  talking about all my friends start telling me that they're doing IVF. Oh, wow. And like, all these [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=221.36s)]
*  people in the audience would hit me up afterwards. Oh, yeah, you know, same thing happened. I was [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=225.84s)]
*  like, What the fuck is this like, the last taboo subject? How did anybody ever get pregnant before [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=229.60000000000002s)]
*  IVF? Because everybody's doing it, dude. It is like, it's unbelievable. It's almost like, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  I was like, Does anybody really get abortion? Like, I'm like, it's so hard to get pregnant. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=241.44000000000003s)]
*  Why is this an issue? Like, how often do these athletes have unprotected sex that they have 20 [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=246.64s)]
*  kids? Like, like, I couldn't believe it. It was unfathomable. So but then it became like, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=252.48s)]
*  as brutal as it was, there was these kind of funny moments that being one of them. Yeah, that that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=259.2s)]
*  did the humility going into the room with the lady. Oh, we just talked to the audience. Doug came in [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=263.52s)]
*  to say hi to Andrew in the commercial break. And we were bonding over our shared experience, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=268.88s)]
*  because he and I did IVF with our kids to Doug joke that after he had to donate the sample. Yeah, [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=273.28s)]
*  first, he said he was gonna wear like a red crushed velvet smoking jacket on his way in and [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=279.2s)]
*  on the way out. He's gonna be like, That was fantastic. I was amazing. Yeah, I was always [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=283.84s)]
*  thinking about like, Do I make noises in there? Like, how uncomfortable do I make it for the other [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=288.4s)]
*  guys at the clinic? Like just screaming random things? Yes. Yes. Street. Crazy. But yeah, it's [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=292.55999999999995s)]
*  like, I was crazy. I was like a walk of shame when you're walking by all the other guys there. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=300.24s)]
*  Everybody's there. Oh, God, I know what you're about to do. It's so humbling. Yes. You're just [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=303.76s)]
*  sitting in this room, like all of you are in there. You're like, So why did they make you go [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=307.68s)]
*  in to give the sperm sample? I didn't think it could be. I did it from home once. Okay. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=312.0s)]
*  The whole I don't even I haven't even put like a lot of the stuff in it. But like the whole journey [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=316.64s)]
*  was brutal. So the first one I did from home, which was like, I'm in the room, my wife like hands me [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=320.16s)]
*  the thing like it's homework. And she's like, Okay, I'll give you 30 minutes, you go do your [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=325.28000000000003s)]
*  thing. I'm going to go outside or I'm going to do the dishes. So like, I hear her doing the dishes [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=329.44s)]
*  in the background where I'm like being mandated to masturbate. And I'm like, on our bed, like I don't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=334.4s)]
*  think I've ever masturbated on a bed. Like I'm just on our bed and the bed is made perfectly. Like [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=340.48s)]
*  everything is like set up. And I remember one point like, I'm just like, I don't know, this is [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=345.68s)]
*  like so weird. I like looked up and the TV was off. So it was just a black screen. So it's a perfect [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=350.08s)]
*  mirror of no and I was just like, this is the saddest day of my life. I'm sitting Indian style on [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=356.24s)]
*  my back. I'm trying to make a simple we send that sample in. It comes back. And it's like, it's not [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=363.2s)]
*  good. And they're like, not only are they not swimming, they're like shaped weird. And I was [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=371.52s)]
*  like, I was like a little defensive. So I was like, well, could that be from like the speed that they [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=375.76s)]
*  hit the cup? Like maybe, you know, it's the blunt force trauma kind of warped them a little. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=380.56s)]
*  The flow is just too strong. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=387.04s)]
*  It was too strong. That's what it is. And they're like, no, that's definitely not it. And I was like, [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=388.0s)]
*  okay. And they go, well, why don't you do this for like a couple months, wear baggy underwear, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=393.44s)]
*  ice your balls every single day. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=399.44s)]
*  Oh, ice them. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=400.88s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I guess that's a big thing. Don't drink anymore. Don't smoke anymore. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=401.76s)]
*  And take these pills and then we'll try it again in like a month or two. And I did that and we tried [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=408.24s)]
*  it again and it got worse. And I was like, why do you think that is? And the doctor was like, [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=413.6s)]
*  we've never seen this before. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=420.64s)]
*  There's some pride in that. It's got to be a little bit records. I told a story one time and [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=423.04s)]
*  Dave Rubin was on, but Doug had the funniest experience there where they make you ejaculate [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=427.68s)]
*  like 24 hours before the real sample. That's going to be like your future kid. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=434.96s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=439.03999999999996s)]
*  They want you to clean house. Yes. It's like, I can't remember if it was 24 or 48 hours before. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=439.52s)]
*  Okay. So, but they want it to be 48 and they don't really want it to be 46 or 44. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=444.08s)]
*  Because you need the amount of time to build up the new batch. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=450.71999999999997s)]
*  Yes. So like timing does matter. It just so happened that on one of ours, [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=452.88s)]
*  we were visiting my, my Nana, who was literally like 90 at the time and we were playing dominoes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=457.12s)]
*  And I was like, Doug, it's time. He was like, what? I'm like, you got to go in there right now. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=464.16s)]
*  My poor husband. And he goes like one of these older person's homes where like there's five [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=470.64000000000004s)]
*  inches between the bottom of the door and the ground. Every piece of conversation and the [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=475.44s)]
*  dominoes like your palm in the double five, you know, and Doug said, horrible for Doug. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=480.64000000000004s)]
*  The thing about this is like, it's a, it's the, the journey is brutal when you're in it is the [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=490.8s)]
*  hardest thing that you'll go through in your life. Sort of the hardest thing we went through. And, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=495.59999999999997s)]
*  but after the fact, it is hysterical. Yes. Like there's believe what you've been through. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=501.2s)]
*  Yeah. And like, there are so many of these things that are so funny. And the beautiful [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=507.44s)]
*  thing about having a child is you get this like amnesia for what you went through to get there. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=511.03999999999996s)]
*  I think that's actually kind of like built into our DNA. So we keep making them. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=516.08s)]
*  I totally agree. You know, same women have been saying that for eons because of the [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=519.52s)]
*  pain of labor and it's so, you know, devastating. And then you forget all about it. I never had [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=523.4399999999999s)]
*  labor because I had three C-sections, but my friends tell me it's extremely painful. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=529.84s)]
*  Oh, my, my Emma was in there for 24 hours and then she had the C-section because the, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=533.68s)]
*  the baby's heart rate dropped. Oh God, that's scary. Yeah. The whole thing is, is, is terrible. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=537.6s)]
*  When you were doing the shots before to prepare for the IVF, like, did you have any fun mood [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=541.68s)]
*  swings or anything? Oh yeah. I was actually fine. I did not have weird mood swings, but it was very [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=547.12s)]
*  funny because Doug does not like he, his mom got this terrible cut in her leg and it was so brutal [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=552.88s)]
*  and Doug was right there. He bandaged it up. He put the medicine on. I was like, [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=559.36s)]
*  I can't take that kind of injury. But you pull out a needle and Doug is one of those like, [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=564.64s)]
*  Oh, so he, so he can't, but he had to at the beginning. As it turned out, he didn't have to, [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=569.92s)]
*  but we thought he did. Yeah. Because in the beginning, they really make it up into a thing. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=574.88s)]
*  Like you got to mix the compound and it's like kind of back in a hard spot to reach. You got to ice [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=578.64s)]
*  the area. Oh my God. Like our future family depends on this. And Doug was in a hot, like a cold sweat [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=582.72s)]
*  and the superintendent of our building at the time, his name was Lance. And they were like, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=589.52s)]
*  it's very important that your wife have a partner that helps her. And Doug is like, [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=592.96s)]
*  this is going to be very hard for Lance. But he did it. He did it. He got it through. But honestly, [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=595.6s)]
*  by the third child, you know, he was no part of it. I was like, I need no ice. I'm good. Boom, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=603.28s)]
*  we're done. Yeah. After the race. It is crazy that they make you mix it at home. So anybody [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=608.8s)]
*  who's not familiar, they give you these two, I guess, hormonal compounds and you have to [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=612.9599999999999s)]
*  put them together in the syringe. It's just the right proportions. I'm like, why isn't this done [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=619.28s)]
*  at the lab? And then we just hit it. Like you don't have to make the Kit Kat, right? Like make the bar [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  and then send it to me. And I remember like watching my wife do these things, making sure [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=629.44s)]
*  it's the right amount. You got to push a little out so no air gets in there. Right. Right. So [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=633.44s)]
*  you don't give yourself an air bubble like life or death. Literally. And she's like, [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=637.2800000000001s)]
*  did I push too much out? Will I not get it? Is this, but they're, yeah, they're fine. I mean, [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=641.12s)]
*  Emma would get like, it would really get her going. I should get angry or just overly emotional. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=646.0s)]
*  But we didn't know that that was the cause. So like, I remember we got into it at a Japanese [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=652.32s)]
*  restaurant. You don't realize how quiet those restaurants are until you're having like a loud [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=658.16s)]
*  blow up with like, and you know, the only thing interrupting the blow up, cause everybody is [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=661.76s)]
*  already quiet at a Japanese restaurant. And then once you have like a verbal altercation, [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=666.88s)]
*  they're really quiet. Oh, I love when somebody has a fight and I'm nearby. Oh my God. Doug and I, [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=671.8399999999999s)]
*  like he'll start talking. I'll be like, be quiet. This is too important to me. Everybody was locked [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=676.88s)]
*  in. They're just slurping udon and watching us. And the only thing that would interrupt it is like [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=680.4s)]
*  when a new person would walk in and you know, the whole restaurant has to go, [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=684.4s)]
*  has to say, Emma would feel like they were interrupting our argument. So, so, so we're [[00:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=687.4399999999999s)]
*  fighting. Emma goes, are you kidding me? And then back to yelling at me. It's just amazing. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=696.4s)]
*  Well, weren't you, so you weren't that guy who was like, she's going through a lot. These are [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=702.16s)]
*  just her emotions. I'm just going to let everything slide. I'm not going to get mad about anything. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=705.84s)]
*  We didn't know that it was the case. So we didn't know until literally that night. I go, [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=710.8s)]
*  Hey, did we do the shot? We did the shot today. Right. And she goes, Oh shit. And we're walking [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=716.4799999999999s)]
*  down. We were on 10 Maersk Street. That's when you put it together that he's hormonal. And then, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=720.56s)]
*  and then she was also like, Oh fuck, I guess I'm like really reactive to this. And then from then [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=724.8s)]
*  on, we stopped going to Japanese restaurants. And then how about after she had the baby? Did she have [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=730.64s)]
*  like, cause you're sleep deprived. You're very hormonal. It's the most insane thing. If you're, [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=734.64s)]
*  did you breastfeed? Yeah. Okay. That is the, I think that this is, I think that is the most [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=740.0s)]
*  difficult part of child rearing is the, the, if you are breastfeeding full time, like meaning [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=747.44s)]
*  every two hours, that is insane. Yeah. It's a lot. That is insane. Every two hours. So you're waking [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=754.88s)]
*  up. I don't think a lot of people know this. You're waking up every two hours in the night. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=762.64s)]
*  You don't get more than an hour of sleep at a time. It's truly like a, like an astronaut training [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=766.88s)]
*  situation. Yeah. No, it's brutal, but then that it, it lets up a little when it lets up. This is [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=771.76s)]
*  beautiful bonding experience that you have with your child. And like, it's something even now, [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=778.96s)]
*  like Emma's still breastfeeding and it's just this thing that she's like, she doesn't even want to [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=782.64s)]
*  let go of it. Yeah. Well then you get to like the six month mark where the baby can start having [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=786.88s)]
*  like smaller, like a solid food and they're still having breast milk. And you're at the point now [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=791.04s)]
*  you're producing more milk than ever. And yet the baby's somewhat getting a little independent [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=797.12s)]
*  and the weight comes shredding off. That's the best moment where you're like, I'm making tons of [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=802.0s)]
*  milk. All these calories are coming off for free. Oh, cause your body is burning calories. But your, [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=808.32s)]
*  your baby doesn't need as much milk as from you as he needed at five months. Cause now he's starting [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=813.6s)]
*  to eat food, but your body doesn't know that. So it's still burning like 800 calories a day. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=818.5600000000001s)]
*  You're like, Oh my God, I found the waste again. There's a normal ass. Thank you, sweet baby. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=823.68s)]
*  I always say they're selling breastfeeding moms all wrong that you would care about the hell of [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=831.3599999999999s)]
*  our babies, but we know that babies who are formula fed are fine too. You have to sell it to them like [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=834.7199999999999s)]
*  Ozempic. You'll be skinny. Yes. It is natural Ozempic. It's natural Ozempic. Let that baby suck the fat out of you. [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=839.28s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=844.96s)]

*  My little boy. What's his name? Nicholas and we call him Nico. [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=928.72s)]
*  Now we talked about this a little backstage at the Super Bowl but how are you handling, I mean true, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=933.68s)]
*  new motherhood. It's not even a year and this crazy job. Yeah, it's a lot. No denying it. He's [[00:15:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=940.0s)]
*  seven months. I had him in the midst of the presidential campaign. Three days before the [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=949.12s)]
*  president almost lost his life in Butler, Pennsylvania. My son was born on the 10th. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=956.48s)]
*  The president was shot on the 13th. It was my first day home with him from the hospital [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=961.04s)]
*  and it kind of threw me right back to work much sooner than I would have probably expected or [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=967.36s)]
*  hoped. But becoming a mother in the midst of this very chaotic political world that I work in [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=973.28s)]
*  has been the best thing I could have ever imagined because it gives you great perspective [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=980.08s)]
*  and it humbles you and my son doesn't give a crap about my job. He just wants me to come home [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=985.92s)]
*  and snuggle and play toys and be present. So it's a difficult balance to prioritize being good at my [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=992.24s)]
*  job and being good as a mother but I just try to prioritize my time and carve out that time when I [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1000.8s)]
*  can and I'm so grateful to have the support system I do. A great husband who can be very present with [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1006.24s)]
*  our child and then of course a wonderful mother and father and friends who chip in when I need [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1011.84s)]
*  them. Your parents must be so proud of you. I think so. I hope a grandchild and access to [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1017.2s)]
*  President Trump in the same year. My mom actually was in town this week to help with our baby because [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1022.1600000000001s)]
*  my husband had some work things to attend to and she came to my briefing yesterday. She was in the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1027.04s)]
*  room. I was like are you sure you want to go in? She'd get annoyed by pesky reporters being rude. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1032.48s)]
*  I brought in some backup yesterday. I brought in my colleagues Walton, Stephen and Kevin. A lot of [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1036.8799999999999s)]
*  the questions were for them. I asked her after. I said how was it? She was like thank God all the [[00:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1042.8s)]
*  questions weren't to you today. I would have been dying in there. She enjoyed it very much. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1046.96s)]
*  My Nana who died at 101. She was in her elderly years not that able to get out and around. If I [[00:17:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1051.28s)]
*  had an important court argument that was on tape I would show it to her and she would get so mad at [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1058.72s)]
*  the judges. She didn't think they should be allowed to ask me any questions. She didn't like [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1064.4s)]
*  opposing counsel. Why is he saying that about you? They don't totally get it. It's a motherly bias [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1068.48s)]
*  that we have for our babies. You are balancing with the baby. Can I just ask you one other [[00:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1074.16s)]
*  question on that because we talk about it all the time especially on the right. I too am a working [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  mom and always have been. I've been a professional woman since I graduated from college or law school [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1085.2s)]
*  but now there's I think a good thing which is the restoration of valuing so-called traditional moms [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1091.12s)]
*  and that's great. The women who take care of their kids full time. Most of my best friends [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1097.4399999999998s)]
*  are doing exactly that but it seems like in the right there's a bit of a shift toward like [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1102.0s)]
*  you can't do what Caroline's doing. That's actually like an unsafe or a dangerous or a bad [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1107.2s)]
*  choice for families, for children which I reject wholesale but you hear it more and more. [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1112.32s)]
*  Do you hear that and what do you think of it? I would reject that it's a bad choice. Is it a tough [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1118.6399999999999s)]
*  choice? Absolutely. As a mother you want to be with your child 24-7. You have that maternal instinct. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1123.12s)]
*  Not all the time. Well right now yes because he's seven months and just squishy and lovable but [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1132.0s)]
*  I'm sure that will change. No but you do have that maternal instinct but also recognizing [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1136.24s)]
*  I'm doing this work for my son and for all children to make this country better and it's a once in a [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1142.6399999999999s)]
*  lifetime opportunity. It's also very it's temporary right? In four years my son will be four years old [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1149.4399999999998s)]
*  and the president will no longer be at the White House and then I'll move on and do something else [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1156.0s)]
*  but you know this chaos of 24-7 work is a temporary matter and that's what at least I tell myself to [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1160.6399999999999s)]
*  get through these very long and hard days but I would reject that you can't be a good mom and be [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1168.32s)]
*  good at your job. I think you can do both. It certainly not it's not for everybody and it [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1173.6s)]
*  takes a lot of work and will and faith and prayer and it's hard but it can be done and you know [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1179.9199999999998s)]
*  I would reject that. We can't chase our great conservative moms out of the workforce. Right. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1189.9199999999998s)]
*  We need them. We get rid of you. We get rid of Katie Britt. We get rid of Usha Vance. Right. [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1195.84s)]
*  Like this is not the way Amy Coney Barrett is not on the supreme like that's not that should not be [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1199.52s)]
*  the place the conservative movement lands. I agree. All right so you so now you start as [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1204.48s)]
*  White House press secretary and were you thrilled to get that invitation? Of course yes. I was very [[00:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1209.36s)]
*  humbled and honored and I was campaigning you know with the president over the past year through the [[00:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1214.24s)]
*  court trials we sat in that courthouse in in Manhattan with the brag trial so many rallies [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1220.56s)]
*  and we worked so damn hard to win that election. You must have really wrestled with how you were [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1226.8s)]
*  going to meet the high bar set by Corrine Jean-Pierre. Sorry. Sorry. Was that out loud? [[00:20:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1230.8s)]
*  No she was terrible. Yeah. I mean come on. Yeah. So yeah how is your approach different would you [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1238.0s)]
*  say? I think it's vastly different and if you ask people even in the legacy media even the Trump [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1242.8s)]
*  haters they will tell you the approach has been much different not just for me but the entire [[00:20:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1249.84s)]
*  White House. Oh absolutely. They come in my office every day and they'll admit that off the record. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1254.48s)]
*  Maybe not on the record but they will say they appreciate the access and the transparency and [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1258.8s)]
*  the preparation that goes into my briefings and everybody on our team by the way who goes out to [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1264.48s)]
*  the cameras and speaks. We have great policy experts who are great spokespeople for the president [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1270.8s)]
*  and they appreciate the information that they're being given. They're also exhausted by the way [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1276.64s)]
*  because we are doing so much. And not even in like a wussy sad little way like they must be exhausted [[00:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1282.5600000000002s)]
*  it's just it's non-stop. It's insane. So who's your least favorite? Well I did have a bit of a tiff [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  this morning outside with our friend Peter Alexander at NBC News. So it was great. We'll drop in a clip [[00:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1295.8400000000001s)]
*  of it where he was really pressing you on whether there's going to be criminal prosecutions for this [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1302.24s)]
*  alleged fraud in the waste, fraud and abuse. According to an IG report from the Social Security [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1307.76s)]
*  Administration there was 71 billion dollars worth of fraud in one single fiscal year that we know [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1313.1200000000001s)]
*  about and so that is a lot of fraud Peter. To be clear that 71 billion dollars was from 2015 to [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1318.96s)]
*  2022 so it wasn't in just one year. 71 billion dollars. But it wasn't in one year just over [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1325.2s)]
*  multiple years from 2015 to 2022. So are you defending 71 billion dollars in fraud Peter? [[00:22:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1331.2s)]
*  That's a lot of money. Why is the media so against cutting waste fraud and abuse from the government? [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1337.28s)]
*  I don't get it. We won't be deterred. We will not be deterred from people like you and the press. [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1342.0800000000002s)]
*  You said something that wasn't true which is you said that they have found before that they believe [[00:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1347.92s)]
*  there have been tens of millions of people who are receiving money who are dead on the Social Security [[00:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1352.64s)]
*  List. The same report that you referred to said that almost none of those individuals are... [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1358.1599999999999s)]
*  Peter did you watch the full clip of the interview that I did when I said that? [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1362.72s)]
*  And I said there are a lot of unanswered questions and we suspect there could be tens of millions of [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1366.8s)]
*  people. So you just said what I said is not true. In fact it was true. That's a suspicion that this [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1373.36s)]
*  administration has and we're committed to finding out the truth. It perplexes me and also infuriates [[00:22:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1379.4399999999998s)]
*  me why the media continues to make excuses for our government spending billions and billions of [[00:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1384.48s)]
*  dollars in wasteful money. Maybe they don't mind but I know there's millions of people watching that [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1390.0s)]
*  do mind so we're going to keep doing what we're doing with Doge. It was a pretty incredible [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1395.04s)]
*  exchange where it was like 71 billion has been spent on fraudulent payments and he's like oh [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1399.3600000000001s)]
*  but that was over many years. Does it matter? Hello? There's one report that showed 71 billion [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1404.88s)]
*  dollars. What are you talking about? Eyes on the ball. Yeah exactly. All right so that's good. I'm [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1410.0s)]
*  glad to hear the NBC guys out. Good choice. Sorry Peter. How do you prepare because you can't know [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1414.56s)]
*  everything and you could get asked anything and unlike Corrine Jean-Pierre you're not out there [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1422.56s)]
*  reading and furiously flipping through your tabs to try to find an answer somebody else has written [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1428.8s)]
*  for you. So how are you preparing? So I did prepare a binder for the first briefing. [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1434.0s)]
*  My great assistant Keegan put it together and then I showed up to work and it was like this thick [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1440.96s)]
*  and I was like I can't even move this. I can't use this. It was too cumbersome for my brain and the [[00:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1447.84s)]
*  way I learn and think and study to have that. It felt like added weight and I said I want to just [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1455.52s)]
*  go in there and speak from my mind and from my heart. Like your boss. Like my boss and I've been [[00:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1461.84s)]
*  working for my boss now on the campaign. I know the policies we're enacting. We've been talking [[00:24:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1468.8s)]
*  about them for years and so and in school I was that way like studying. I would just read, you [[00:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1473.9199999999998s)]
*  know, highlight, memorize, articulate. And then it goes off to the side. Yeah. And you talk. Exactly [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1480.8799999999999s)]
*  and so that's been my method of preparation. No nerves? The first briefing I was certainly [[00:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1487.04s)]
*  nervous. I think any human would and I'm not afraid to admit that. But it must have been cool [[00:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1492.8799999999999s)]
*  to get up there. It was. You know once I got up there I realized okay like I can do this. I know [[00:24:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1496.8799999999999s)]
*  what I need to know and now I feel very, you know, comfortable and confident and you know I will [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1503.68s)]
*  never get complacent because I understand the weight of the responsibility on my shoulders [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1510.8799999999999s)]
*  speaking on behalf of the President of the United States. So I remain as prepared today as I was on [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1515.52s)]
*  that first day and I hope that's true four years from now. And I have we have amazing people in [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1520.4s)]

*  and so we were up hours before the U.S. was up and so I was seeing the results, the poll results and [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1730.24s)]

*  of compromise and then it's a little more compromise and a little more compromise and [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1791.04s)]

*  we must continue to stay in prayer and petition and believing that something really good is [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=1999.76s)]
*  happening right now and do it with empathy make sure that people are not being just [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2005.8400000000001s)]

*  but I think that these are things that have been long long long overdue long overdue and we deserve [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2015.84s)]
*  it everyone deserves this kind of transparency like light is the best disinfectant like just get [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2024.48s)]
*  in there just look at it all let's have a real coming to Jesus moment and we need to do that with [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2029.6s)]
*  all things we need to bring the American public in on a lot of these things that have been secretive [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2034.32s)]
*  no no no we can't tell them like rip the band-aid off SSRIs talking about that openly I mean that [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2039.28s)]
*  has been more out there in the conversation but it's very bold for the HHS director to say [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2044.08s)]
*  we actually are going to be looking into these it's just the Americans are taking the antidepressants [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2048.64s)]
*  like they're candy and they don't realize why they're not getting better and then they up the [[00:34:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2052.96s)]
*  dosage and then they try a different one and they up the dosage there and there's no actual public [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2056.48s)]
*  health official being really straight with them on the downsides of these drugs and how there might [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2061.12s)]
*  be alternative ways not to rip on those drugs they have been helpful for a lot of people but [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2065.52s)]
*  they're not for everybody and it's the first line of defense my friend has a daughter in college [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2069.36s)]
*  and she went to like the college counseling place because it can be a difficult adjustment [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2073.84s)]
*  they try to push an SSRI on her it's like for the love of god maybe just talk to her do talk [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2078.56s)]
*  therapy talk do cognitive behavioral therapy before we just knee-jerk give the drug well [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2083.52s)]
*  absolutely but but I think that there's even more effective ways of solving for all of this and you [[00:34:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2088.24s)]
*  really got to go to the source you got to go to the root right why are SSRIs pushed on everybody [[00:34:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2094.48s)]
*  so much it's because there's incentive programs why are vaccines and the vaccine schedule pushed [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2100.96s)]
*  on children so hard because there's incentives why should there be incentives for doctors [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2106.16s)]
*  to push what should just be healthy and natural and good you shouldn't have to incentivize a [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2111.44s)]
*  doctor to encourage their their their patients to do something that's been tested and is safe [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2117.12s)]
*  and effective and everything you just have a doctor say oh this is great so why are you having [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2122.24s)]
*  to pay them x amount of dollars bonus to make sure if they get 95 percent of their pediatrician [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2126.3999999999996s)]
*  gets 95 percent of the people in their in their practice and the children all fully vaxxed up and [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2131.6s)]
*  then you give them hundreds of thousands of dollars in return this is not okay so I think that [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2137.04s)]
*  if we actually start to regulate these these industries all of that downstream pushing and [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2142.4799999999996s)]
*  stuff that's all going to kind of start to resolve itself and once it gets exposed 100 [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2147.68s)]
*  moreover I think when it comes to our farming situation listen maybe under FDR incentivizing [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2151.7599999999998s)]
*  farmers getting out of the great depression there's some there was some good that they were [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2158.24s)]
*  trying to do with all of that but all that did was led to it led to like bad capitalism run amok and [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2161.9199999999996s)]
*  people in industrial farming and companies like Monsanto creating glyphosate and atrazine and all [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2169.12s)]
*  of these things that are poisoning us which is why you can literally eat all the bread you want [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2175.2s)]
*  in europe and you can't eat any bread in the united states that's the point we don't have to [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2179.2799999999997s)]
*  have this on our wheat we don't have to eat our pasta and our bread like this but what I think [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2182.3199999999997s)]
*  like one of the biggest first things that they can do is if you instead of incentivizing farmers to [[00:36:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2187.2s)]
*  do massive monocropping with industrial fertilizer instead start incentivizing farmers and we by the [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2191.7599999999998s)]
*  way we must because to to incentivize farmers to have regenerative organic farms ron johnson was [[00:36:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2198.24s)]

*  our soil is dead we only have so many more cycles left because the nutrients have all been sucked [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2209.68s)]
*  out of it through all the industrial fertilizing and the and the tilling for monocropping it's [[00:36:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2215.6s)]
*  destroying our environment so people that want to solve for all of these things guys we can help the [[00:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2220.7999999999997s)]

*  rich woman yeah who you know in her case it's questionable but in a lot of these other women's [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2754.1600000000003s)]
*  cases they their husbands are multi-millionaires or billionaires and then the women like open a [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2759.6800000000003s)]
*  charity yes or like give their money to somebody and then they're like i'm an entrepreneur i'm an [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2765.36s)]

*  right doesn't make you a founder well it's also she never cared you know it was all about in the [[00:46:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2781.36s)]
*  beginning it was all about like unwinding the systems of oppression yeah they remember that's [[00:46:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2786.6400000000003s)]
*  done didn't you know remember that you saw that remember that it was like she would go to like a [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2791.6800000000003s)]
*  third world country and there'd be a bunch of kids dancing and she'd take a photo with them now it [[00:46:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2796.08s)]
*  seems much more about like she's looking at like guinness pouch or what guinness pouch did with her [[00:46:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2801.68s)]
*  store yes goop or whatever it's i think it's goop yeah and i think she's looking at that going that's [[00:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2806.64s)]
*  what she wants to be she wants to be martha stewart yeah although what i found out after the fact was [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2811.44s)]
*  she launched her show with showing you how to make this one recipe it's like one pot pasta you make [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2816.24s)]
*  it on that stove and then everybody flooded twitter with the fact that that apparently is a martha [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2821.7599999999998s)]
*  stewart recipe sure that's apparently very well known in martha stewart yeah so even the inaugural [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2828.0s)]
*  episode is is cheating off of somebody else's well i mean you gotta hand it to her it she knows that [[00:47:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2832.88s)]
*  we don't have a memory yes the country doesn't have a memory we have a fatally short memory [[00:47:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2839.2s)]
*  and we're kind of tolerant of however people want to reintroduce themselves in the moment yes so she [[00:47:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2845.76s)]
*  understands america i didn't know better than than i do or maybe you do because she gets it we [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2851.28s)]
*  love the hockster we root for the hockster we root for kind of the criminal sometimes and she's [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2857.84s)]
*  kind of assuming that role of going this is who i am today we got to talk about bill bella check [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2863.76s)]
*  you ripped him okay i i mean i thought it was elder abuse i like honestly what i saw there was [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2869.28s)]
*  dr jill had dr jill vibes this overly aggressive younger partner who's in this like apparently he [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2874.4s)]
*  looked infirm to me the way he was answering those questions like man who's being taken advantage of [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2881.76s)]
*  and all i could think was his family needs to do an intervention and get this woman off of his back [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2887.28s)]
*  but can you set the stage for us on like what what's happening with this guy i'll start by saying i [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2890.7200000000003s)]
*  am a diehard new england patriots fan yeah you're from boston diehard i love bill balachek he's like [[00:48:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2895.28s)]
*  my guy has brought so many championships i know him personally he lives on nantucket i live on [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2901.2000000000003s)]
*  nantucket i've met jordan so it's a very awkward thing to see i also watch that show cbs sunday [[00:48:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2906.48s)]
*  morning with the interview it's like my feel-good show i just like it i like nature there's some [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2912.72s)]
*  politics whatever but for the most part that is a drink your coffee eat your bagel feel good [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2918.0s)]
*  show so i was not expecting this interview i was squirming i don't know what to expect i don't know [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2924.3199999999997s)]
*  what to think about it uh it certainly was awkward i've heard people say you know is she taking [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2930.48s)]
*  advantage of him well he's taking advantage of her he's sleeping with a very attractive young [[00:48:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2938.8s)]
*  girl 50 years younger i don't know why she's so involved like i really don't um i've met her she's [[00:49:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2942.88s)]
*  nice enough it she's running the whole show i've known that a couple months ago how so like she [[00:49:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2951.1200000000003s)]
*  every every piece of bill balachek business goes through her like she is basically let she would [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2956.6400000000003s)]
*  act like if that was maybe not in a romantic relationship and that's his pr manager or like [[00:49:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2963.6s)]
*  an agent yeah nobody's blinking at that like that happens i'm sure a lot with celebs we're not [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2971.2s)]
*  going to talk about it now you combine it with bill balachek who's gruff with the media and [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2976.08s)]
*  generally always handles himself it's just a very awkward situation the age gap is huge clearly [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2980.3199999999997s)]
*  but she runs the show there's rumors hard knocks for hbl was supposed to do north carolina she [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2986.0s)]
*  shut that down um the state that's where he's the coach now yeah he's the coach there so it's just uh [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2991.76s)]
*  it's such a juxtaposition of a guy who seemingly had no media savvy but was always just straightforward [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=2998.48s)]
*  no time for the media now having his life run by a 25 year old it certainly is eye opening for a [[00:50:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3007.6800000000003s)]
*  guy like me i also know i'm going to run into probably them and then tuck in and i'm going to [[00:50:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3014.0s)]
*  be carrying my watermelon out of stop and shop and i don't want it to be an awkward conversation [[00:50:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3019.28s)]
*  but it went super viral i mean it's all anybody's talking about it's all any because it's just such [[00:50:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3025.36s)]
*  a departure from how a sports fan patriot fan everybody thought of bill balachek so explain [[00:50:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3031.44s)]
*  that to me because we watch the i come into this like at a left field i know who he is of course [[00:50:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3038.0800000000004s)]
*  even i know who bill balachek greatest coach of all time but i don't follow his you know i didn't [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3042.4s)]
*  know about the girlfriend and all that um to me he looked out of it like he seemed confused but i've [[00:50:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3047.04s)]
*  never ever seen yeah so i've seen a lot of people like he's wearing a holy sweatshirt that's what he [[00:50:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3053.84s)]
*  does like that that is his look does he talk like that like does he look confused generally [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3058.72s)]
*  he generally if he doesn't want to answer a question he grumbles he says i'm not going to [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3064.16s)]
*  answer that he's famous for not answering questions he's never media savvy him going on a book tour [[00:51:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3068.24s)]
*  which is what he was doing seems like the last thing he would ever do in a million years if she [[00:51:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3074.48s)]
*  wasn't there i would anticipate him just being like i'm not going to answer it he's he's rarely [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3080.48s)]
*  conducting interviews that he has no interest and he just doesn't care for the media or what they [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3087.76s)]
*  think the thing that he said that was the most accurate is probably i don't care what people [[00:51:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3092.56s)]
*  think about me and clearly he doesn't but i've never seen him defer to anybody like that that [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3096.8s)]
*  is the most shocking yeah like if someone else is speaking for him that never happens he speaks for [[00:51:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3104.4s)]
*  himself loudly through his actions clearly and is always like a general in in the commander of the [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3109.92s)]
*  room really so to see him basically give what appears to be control of his life to her is [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3116.8s)]
*  shocking any go ahead most the audience have probably seen the clip by now but just in case [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3124.64s)]

*  input that's it you would never make a promise ever it's literally considered unethical to say [[00:54:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3275.92s)]
*  i won't ask about that you know at most i've ever heard somebody say is we can't make you any promises [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3280.96s)]
*  but you know we're not that interested in that subject like a wink and a nap but never never has [[00:54:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3286.2400000000002s)]
*  a pr person ever interviewed interjected into into an in the middle of it no it's very unusual [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3291.44s)]
*  people asking now if someone doesn't want to talk about it we generally want because people [[00:54:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3297.12s)]
*  generally want to talk about what you are asking not to talk about so we won't do it it's strange [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3300.16s)]
*  i i don't agree with that it was different rules if it's like a host you know i mean if you're [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3305.28s)]
*  sitting to somebody who doesn't consider themselves a journalist very different and by the way this is [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3310.0s)]
*  how talk shows get away with it all the time i've been asked to go on a bunch of talk shows including [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3312.96s)]
*  tamarind halls like five years ago and her executive producer said we'll give you all the [[00:55:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3317.36s)]
*  questions in advance i'm like i'm not doing that i felt like i don't want that yeah right so it's [[00:55:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3321.76s)]
*  she got got away with it because they consider that a talk show but she's not i guess calling [[00:55:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3326.4s)]
*  herself a journalist anymore at least wasn't for that show okay so then jennifer belichick's [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3330.4s)]
*  daughter-in-law dying to hear this weighs in and says publicists act in a professional matter and [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3334.96s)]
*  do not storm on storm offset delaying an interview yeah so i know them too this is all like uh and [[00:55:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3340.8s)]
*  that probably tells you everything you need to know about how the family and that's natural [[00:55:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3349.6800000000003s)]
*  there's a story that came out in the new york post i think yesterday that she accumulated like [[00:55:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3353.6000000000004s)]
*  10 million dollars of real estate very quickly so i'm sure the family based on that quote is a [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3357.52s)]
*  little like what is going on here and it's just this is a guy that is not a pushover he has built [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3362.8s)]
*  his reputation on being like a gruff kind of guy who needs everything particular and detail oriented [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3368.64s)]
*  it's just very strange to see he's the guy tim walsh was trying to convince us he was no jazz [[00:56:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3376.08s)]
*  hands yeah football yeah i don't even know if even he was the guy man yeah he was trying to i think [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3382.7999999999997s)]
*  be more like a gronk guy but who knows well there's more so he probably you know about this because i [[00:56:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3389.04s)]
*  saw you commented on it um so bill belichick posted a statement on the unc university north [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3395.36s)]
*  carolina chapel hill is where he coaches right chapel hill yep um and he he wrote wrote as [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3403.6s)]
*  follows i agreed to speak with cbs sunday morning to promote my new book the art of winning um prior [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3408.2400000000002s)]
*  to the interview i clearly communicated with my publicist so he's not even saying he told tony [[00:56:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3413.2000000000003s)]
*  docapool or the cbs publicist i clearly communicated with my publicist at simon and schuster that any [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3417.92s)]
*  promotional interviews i participated in would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3423.76s)]
*  unfortunately that expectation was not honored during the interview i was surprised when [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3427.84s)]
*  unrelated topics were introduced and i repeatedly expressed to the reporter tony docapool and the [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3431.84s)]
*  producers that i preferred to keep the conversation centered on the book after this occurred several [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3436.6400000000003s)]
*  times jordan with whom i share both the personal and professional relationship stepped in to [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3440.5600000000004s)]
*  reiterate that point and help refocus the discussion she was not deflecting any specific question or [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3443.92s)]
*  topic i'm sorry bill but she was but was simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3448.2400000000002s)]
*  track some of the clips made it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met but [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3453.04s)]
*  we've been open about the fact that jordan i met on a flight to palm beach in 2021 and goes on for [[00:57:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3456.24s)]
*  them saying these are just selectively uh selectively edited clips suggested a false narrative that [[00:57:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3461.04s)]
*  jordan was attempting to control the conversation which is simply not true yeah i'm like white [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3466.24s)]
*  knuckle in the table uh in my years following bill bella check i would say my knowledge of him [[00:57:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3471.12s)]
*  there's roughly zero percent chance he wrote that he just he just doesn't care generally [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3480.96s)]
*  what anyone thinks about him so to go write that that my guess would be jordan wrote that the fact [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3487.84s)]
*  it is on the north carolina website is insane right it's just insane um it's shocking again it's [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3494.0s)]
*  i'm speaking to all patriot fans boston people this guy like [[00:58:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3504.08s)]
*  if you could have predicted this people would say you're living in a bizarro world it's just [[00:58:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3508.24s)]
*  so strange in this long email crazy the public statement crazy but i i'm not even sure [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3512.48s)]
*  he knows that was written you're right like he may not how does greenland fit into all of this [[00:58:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3520.0s)]
*  well the arctic which has gotten very little attention but the arctic circle on the arctic [[00:58:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3526.24s)]
*  region is going to become critical for shipping lanes for how do you get some of this energy [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3531.2s)]
*  that's going to be produced under president trump these energies rely on shipping lanes [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3535.6s)]
*  the arctic is some of the most valuable shipping lanes in the world as some of the ice is melting [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3540.64s)]
*  there's become more and more navigable we need to be able to defend that so if you project what the [[00:59:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3545.2799999999997s)]
*  chinese have done it is just a matter of time before because they are not an arctic power they [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3549.8399999999997s)]
*  do not have an arctic presence so they need to be able to have somewhere that they can stage from [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3554.64s)]
*  and it is completely realistic to believe that the chinese will eventually maybe even in the [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3558.8799999999997s)]
*  short term try to do in greenland what they have done at the panama canal and in other places and [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3564.0s)]
*  that is install facilities that give them access to the arctic with the cover of a chinese company [[00:59:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3569.36s)]
*  but that in reality serve a dual purpose that in a moment of conflict they could send naval vessels [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3574.88s)]
*  to that facility and operate from there and that is completely unacceptable to the national security [[00:59:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3580.08s)]
*  of the world and to the united to the security of the world and the national security of the [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3586.16s)]
*  united states so the question becomes if the chinese begin to threaten greenland do we [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3589.76s)]
*  really trust that that is not a place where those deals are going to be made do we really [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3593.76s)]
*  trust that that is not a place where they would not intervene you don't think denmark would stop [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3598.0s)]
*  them i think that's been the president's point and that is that denmark can't stop them they [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3603.2000000000003s)]
*  would rely on the united states to do so and so his point is if the united states is on the hook [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3607.6000000000004s)]
*  to provide as we are now we have a defense agreement with them to protect greenland if [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3612.1600000000003s)]
*  it comes under assault if we're already on the hook for having to do that then what we might as [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3616.88s)]
*  well have more control over what happens there and so i know it's a delicate topic for denmark [[01:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3621.36s)]
*  but it's again a national interest item for the united states so there was a con a conference [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3626.88s)]
*  call between president trump and the danish prime minister apparently didn't go very well [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3631.84s)]
*  reportedly involved some sort of a meltdown on the prime minister's part they don't want to give it [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3638.88s)]
*  up so what does that what options does that leave us because president trump did not rule out [[01:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3644.32s)]
*  economic or potentially military use well i think president trump's what he has said publicly is he [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3650.8799999999997s)]
*  wants to buy it he wants to pay for it and how we worked on something like that how something like [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3657.2799999999997s)]
*  that is approached obviously has probably done better in the appropriate forums as opposed a lot [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3663.4399999999996s)]
*  of the stuff is done publicly and it's not helpful because it puts the other side in a tough spot [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3668.0s)]
*  domestically so those conversations are going to happen but this is not a joke like what he is [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3671.68s)]
*  saying is is pretty accurate people don't talk about it for years we do have this is not about [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3676.56s)]
*  acquiring land for the purpose of acquiring land this is in our national interest and it needs to [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3681.04s)]
*  be solved president trump's put out there what he intends to do which is to purchase it i wasn't [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3685.2799999999997s)]
*  privy to that phone call but i imagine the phone call went the way a lot of these phone calls go [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3690.48s)]
*  and that is he just speaks bluntly and frankly with people and and ultimately i think diplomacy [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3694.4s)]
*  in many cases works better when you're straightforward as opposed to using platitudes and [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3699.52s)]
*  language that translates to nothing so when president trump said he might use [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3704.72s)]
*  economic or military coercion what does that mean well i don't i don't remember him saying [[01:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3708.96s)]
*  military coercion he did he was asked you know what would you rule out you rule it out right [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3714.48s)]
*  i don't think he's in the he listen he also brings to this he said no i won't rule it out [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3719.68s)]
*  because he brings to this this is a businessman who's involved in politics not a politician [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3724.72s)]
*  involved in politics so he approaches these issues from a transactional business point of view [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3730.8s)]
*  so he is not going to begin what he views as a negotiation or a conversation by taking anything [[01:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3736.2400000000002s)]
*  leverage off the table okay and that's a that's a tactic that's used all the time in business it's [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3741.92s)]
*  being applied to foreign policy and i think to great effect in the first time you look at the [[01:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3746.4s)]
*  abraham accords and the democrats mocked the abraham accords when they were made and then by [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3751.04s)]
*  the end of the biden administration they became the linchpin of a lot of what we're hoping to [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3755.84s)]
*  build on that never would have happened had there not been a transactional approach you look at [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3760.0s)]
*  what his envoy to the middle east steve woodcoff has achieved that that the biden administration [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3764.0s)]
*  asked woodcoff they asked for him to be involved in these conversations he has brought a businessman's [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3768.16s)]
*  approach to a very delicate and intractable foreign policy challenge and delivered a ceasefire that [[01:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3773.28s)]
*  obviously is tenuous and has long-term challenges to it but there are hostages being released every [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3779.92s)]
*  day that didn't happen for over a year and a half until he became involved and that's the president's [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3784.56s)]
*  envoy a very close friend who's brought the same kind of business approach to some of these [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3788.88s)]
*  challenges so let's look forward four years does the u.s. own greenland we'll see i mean obviously [[01:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3793.44s)]
*  that's the president's priority he has made that point i think that what i can tell you about four [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3800.2400000000002s)]
*  years without getting into specifics because i don't you know i'm not we're not in a position [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3804.08s)]
*  yet to discuss exactly how we'll proceed tactically what i think you can rest assured of is that four [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3808.08s)]
*  years from now our interest in the arctic will be more secure our interest in the panama canal will [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3813.52s)]
*  be more secure our partnerships in the western hemisphere will be stronger will be stronger we [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3818.64s)]
*  need to understand a lot of these countries in central america they're not destination sites [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3823.8399999999997s)]
*  they are countries that migrants come through and that and that these human trafficking rings run [[01:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3828.4s)]
*  people run people through it creates tremendous instability for these countries at a tremendous [[01:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3833.2s)]
*  cost as well they would welcome help in stopping that migration corridor from continuing because [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3837.68s)]
*  it's destabilizing their countries so i think we're going to have a western hemisphere it's [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3843.12s)]
*  more secure and our national interest in all parts of the world that's the goal are going [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3846.72s)]
*  to be more secure from the arctic to central america to even africa [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDswXheSfiY&t=3850.3999999999996s)]
