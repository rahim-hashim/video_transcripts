# Megyn's NYT Interview, WHCA Fires Unfunny Comedian From Dinner, and Newsom's Failed Shift w/ The EJs
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [March 31, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show and happy Monday. The [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=0.0s)]
*  White House Correspondence Association is reversing course deciding that we are now [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  in such a quote, consequential moment for journalism, that they will be canceling their [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=9.84s)]
*  scheduled comedian for their big gala in late April and focusing only on honoring the very [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=16.2s)]
*  important work our corporate media does every day to fight for democracy or something like [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=24.12s)]
*  that. They really want to honor the White House reporters who gave it all, left it all on the [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=29.64s)]
*  playing field this year. You know how like they covered the Biden mental infirmity so closely [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=35.24s)]
*  and explosively and blew the lid, right? Oh wait, no, that never happened. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=42.52s)]
*  Will that award be given in April for all the people who completely blew it? And instead of [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=48.2s)]
*  exposing that, ran cover for him? Because yeah, that happened over the past 12 months since their [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=53.96s)]
*  last big gala. Or are we just going to honor the reporters who are taking a dump on Donald Trump [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=59.24s)]
*  every day? I can't wait to find out. I was invited to this shindig and as I have for every year over [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=65.56s)]
*  the past 10, I declined to go. I'm not going to this. When I was a very young reporter, I found [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=72.2s)]
*  this exciting before I understood what was what in Washington and back frankly, when it was relevant [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=77.56s)]
*  and kind of cool. I hate to tell the people going those days are over. You're now sort of saying yes [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=82.92s)]
*  to what's become a loser party where they can only get the dregs. And I urge anybody with ego [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=90.12s)]
*  and self-respect to say no, no, not going to that. And speaking of corporate media, I went over to [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=98.44s)]
*  the New York Times earlier this month. I mean the actual New York Times building, the belly of the [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=107.4s)]
*  beast and sat down for two hours for their quote, the interview podcast. This is part of the biggest [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=113.4s)]
*  podcast in America called the daily, which the New York Times drops Monday through Friday. And then [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=123.4s)]
*  on Saturday, they drop quote, the interview podcast with millions of downloads per episode. And I have [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=128.92000000000002s)]
*  some thoughts and some behind the scenes moments for you on what happened, how it came out and why [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=135.96s)]
*  I did it. So let's get into it. Joining me now, the EJs, Emily Jasinski, DC correspondent for Unheard [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=141.72s)]
*  and host of Undercurrents and Eliana Johnson, editor in chief of the Washington Free Beacon [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=148.36s)]

*  YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. You know how much my family and I love our dogs, [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=162.04s)]
*  right? Even sweet Strudwick cannot imagine life without them. They've got a great life, [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=167.4s)]
*  but some dogs are not so lucky and they need our help. This is why I'm so glad to tell you about [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=172.76s)]
*  Delta Rescue, the largest no kill care for life animal sanctuary in the world. They have rescued [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=177.64s)]
*  thousands of dogs plus cats and horses too. They provide all the animals with shelter, [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=183.64s)]
*  safety and most of all, love. And they've been doing it for more than 45 years now. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=188.68s)]

*  Strudwick, but we would like other dogs who need love to find it too. Visit deltarescue.org today [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=207.96s)]
*  to learn more. That's deltarescue.org. Ladies, welcome back. Hey, Megan. Hey, Megan. Great to [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=214.84s)]
*  see you both. Good to be here. Okay. So why I went over to the New York Times, they gave me this [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=222.76s)]
*  invitation and I talked with Steve Krakauer, my executive producer about it quite a bit. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=231.48000000000002s)]
*  And Abby's funny because she always like gets the incoming. She's like, don't do it. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=237.0s)]
*  Don't do it. She's like, they're going to hate you. You don't want any. And she's very defensive [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=240.36s)]
*  of me. But Steve was more like, we should consider this one. And we talked about it. And I have a [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=248.20000000000002s)]
*  couple of things that we're promoting right now, like our AM update and our expansion into this [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=254.04000000000002s)]
*  more podcast network where we're bringing on other voices and trying to promote them. So I thought if [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=260.36s)]
*  I were to do it, this would be a time. And the truth is I listen to the daily most days and I [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=265.08000000000004s)]
*  talk about the daily on this show a lot. And I'm a weird fan of the show. Like I, I love to rip on [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=270.12s)]
*  it, but I do learn from it as well. I think it's a useful podcast. Sometimes it's useful just to bash. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=275.96s)]
*  Sometimes it actually does provide information. Like I loved the podcast they did on what Trump's [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=283.48s)]
*  tariffs are doing down in Mexico when it comes to fentanyl labs. Like that was actually a fair [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=288.76s)]
*  and balanced piece. And I think they're making an effort to like drop a few here and there that [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=294.12s)]
*  might be a little more acceptable to Trump fans. In any event, I figured I would, I would do it. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=298.68s)]
*  So I was asked to sit down with Lulu Garcia Navarro, who is a legit reporter. She's been all [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=306.52s)]
*  over the world covering actual news for the New York Times and other outlets for many, many years. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=314.76s)]
*  And I didn't know her very well. I knew she'd done JD Vance and she seemed fair with him. So I figured, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=319.8s)]
*  all right, you know, here we go. And Michael Barbaro is the host of the one Monday through [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=327.4s)]
*  Friday. And I truth be told, I kind of like him and we have a friendly relationship, not friends, [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=332.12s)]
*  but friendly. So in any event, I decided to go over there. So it was 90 minutes sitting down [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  together in the New York Times building. And then it was another, I don't know, half an hour or 45 [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=342.68s)]
*  minutes the next day after you've had a time to reflect, which is kind of funny. Even that is kind [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=346.2s)]
*  of leftist, right? We're going to reflect and then we're going to chat again. So we went over to the [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=351.8s)]
*  New York Times building guys. And it was very fun. It was walking in there. I have to say they were [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=359.24s)]
*  very nice. They were very polite. They treated me well, but you know, there are all these heads at [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=364.36s)]
*  the New York Times like, Whoa, is that walking through like, yes. And then you could hear all [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=368.76s)]
*  the like, like, as we, and we weren't even on the main floor. We were just all like on the [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=376.76s)]
*  podcast floor, but everybody would did like a 180. It was very funny. And the one guy, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=381.4s)]
*  sort of the handler who was dealing with me before Lulu came in and said, you know, Lulu, [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=387.64s)]
*  she often takes people up into like the heart of the newsroom when the interview is over and [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=392.59999999999997s)]
*  introduces them to people. So she might do that with you. Let's just say that didn't happen. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=397.32s)]
*  It was, there was no tour of the New York Times. It was a no. I appreciate that. Why did, why would [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=402.12s)]
*  she want to do that? Why would this gains Lulu zero street cred in walking through the New York [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=410.6s)]
*  Times newsroom with me. It was fine. But I have to say I liked her. She was very kind to me, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=415.8s)]
*  like in terms of our, you know, dealings behind the scenes, she was very nice. You can kind of [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=423.48s)]
*  tell when someone hates your guts and they're about to interview you. I didn't feel that way [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=426.92s)]
*  about her. And the interview itself didn't reflect some, you know, animus on her part or bad faith. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  I thought, you know, she's, I think of the left and came at these issues from the left that was [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=437.88s)]
*  understood and not surprising, but I didn't sit her sit across from her thinking, this is someone [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=443.64s)]
*  who can't stand me. And that would have led to a bad interview had I felt that way. So that's why [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=448.76s)]
*  I think it all worked. You know, it came off fine. I was more relaxed and giving her answers. And [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=453.56s)]
*  she was a good interview in terms of saying, like, tell me about that, as opposed to, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=460.44s)]
*  you know, just trying to hammer me on various things. So in any event, it posted on Saturday. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=465.4s)]
*  I hope people take a listen to it. We'll talk about a couple of sound bites and a couple of the [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=469.71999999999997s)]
*  outtakes, just because those are always fun to know, you know, what happened. We released a couple [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=473.0s)]
*  on social media over the weekend. And I'll tell you, the biggest divide between Lulu and yours, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=479.47999999999996s)]
*  truly, which we talked about was she didn't understand exactly what it is people like us [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=485.15999999999997s)]
*  do. The two women I'm looking at and myself, right? That like, we do offer political commentary, [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=491.72s)]
*  and we do offer our own opinions, but we also are journalists. But we all exist in this new [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=499.08000000000004s)]
*  ecosphere, right? Like we all have podcasts, we all have direct relationships with our audiences. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=505.32000000000005s)]
*  We're all in new media, as opposed to corporate legacy media. You know, the free beacon is its [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=511.16s)]
*  own entity. But I mean, Eliana does instinct wretches and is very honest. In any event, [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=517.32s)]
*  that was where we really kept tripping wires, because she didn't get how I can still call [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=523.88s)]
*  myself a journalist and have endorsed Donald Trump. Which one is that, Steve? [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=529.1600000000001s)]
*  Okay, that's number four. And we'll kick it off with that one. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=535.88s)]
*  You interviewed him. And it was a fair interview, a tough interview, but you opened it by saying, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=540.36s)]
*  that he was a friend. You said, I've been really dismayed by the amount of pylon [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=547.4000000000001s)]
*  that he's been suffering. And I've been outraged by the unfairness of the media's [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=552.44s)]
*  coverage of the allegations. And that's a direct quote. And so, I'm curious what you're doing in [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=556.12s)]
*  that interview, because you're setting up the interview in a particular kind of way that perhaps [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=562.12s)]
*  it wouldn't be set up in the mainstream media. Yeah. Well, I'm glad you asked that, because I [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=567.4000000000001s)]
*  feel like part of our discussion before and today is getting at something that our wires are [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=574.28s)]
*  crossing. Your wires and my wires are crossing in a way. You're kind of looking at me and saying, [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=582.4399999999999s)]
*  it's not behaving like a typical journalist. And it is still calling itself a journalist. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=587.88s)]
*  And I'm trying to say to you, yes, I'm still a journalist. I'm trying to understand it. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=592.92s)]
*  But yeah, no, I know. I'm not saying you're judging me. Right. But I'm trying to say to you, [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=596.36s)]
*  yes, I'm still a journalist, but I'm in this new ecosystem where the old rules don't apply. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=601.88s)]
*  I'm in this world with, yes, Charlie Kirk and Dan Bongino and Ben Shapiro. But my world is also [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=608.4399999999999s)]
*  Joe Rogan with these in-depth interviews and also Theo Von. And it's a very large world. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=615.96s)]
*  And how the consumer receives it is by going on youtube.com on their television screen [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=623.24s)]
*  or going to the vertical integrations on Instagram or TikTok and just taking in content. What's the [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=630.1999999999999s)]
*  content that you want to receive? I'm on the list of content creators. And so the fact that I'm also [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=636.6s)]
*  a journalist who breaks news and reports on news is like an extra. But what's most important in [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=641.08s)]
*  my business now is authenticity, that you are honest with the audience. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=647.96s)]
*  And really this is a point we just kept coming back to where she thinks in a way, you can be too [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=653.88s)]
*  honest if you get on stage with a political candidate and endorse him and tell people you're [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=659.96s)]
*  voting for him and you think they should too, that you've crossed a bridge that burns as you walk [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=664.44s)]
*  across it and you can never return back over to journalism land. And I just didn't see it that way [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=671.4s)]
*  at all. We had a long debate and a lot of debates about owning one's bias. And she didn't understand [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=677.64s)]
*  if you own your bias, doesn't that sell your soul basically? How can the audience then trust you [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=686.28s)]
*  to rip on your own side? And the following soundbite is in that context, Satwan. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=692.6s)]
*  I think the most serious thing I've heard about him has been the E. Jean Carroll allegation that [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=699.4s)]
*  he sexually assaulted her in a Bergdorf dressing room. And I don't believe one word of that. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=703.88s)]
*  There are other women who have said- [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=711.48s)]
*  I know, I've interviewed some of them. But look, the things I heard were included things like he [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=714.04s)]
*  got handsy on an airplane. Now I don't know whether that happened or it didn't, but do I find that a [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=720.12s)]
*  deal breaker for a possible politician? Not really. At least I reported on their stories [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=724.92s)]
*  and did them the courtesy of bringing them to air in front of millions of people and let the audience [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=731.32s)]
*  make up its mind. My problem is more with these Democrats who will bury these allegations against [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=736.0400000000001s)]
*  their candidates or their candidate spouses and then play holier than thou when they're looking [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=741.4s)]
*  at Donald Trump. Do you see yourself as a journalist still? Or would you not describe yourself like that [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=746.28s)]
*  anymore? No, I'm still a journalist. I mean, I break news all the time. And when I sit with Trump or anybody [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=751.72s)]
*  else in the administration, I ask tough questions. I mean, as recently as September of 23, I interviewed [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=755.64s)]
*  Trump and he got so mad at me. He didn't talk to me for six or seven months. So it's not, look, [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=760.44s)]
*  it's a tough job to do. You have to be able to hit the people you admire. And I do. I've hit them all [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=767.24s)]
*  right before the election. I ripped on Trump's Madison Square Garden rally as too bro-tastic [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=774.84s)]
*  and got specific about why. You have to understand, if you haven't sold your soul, you have to be [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=779.5600000000001s)]
*  willing to criticize the people even you that you admire on your quote side. And my owning my bias [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=786.84s)]
*  by going out there on stage with Donald Trump and saying, I'm voting for him and you should too, [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=793.8000000000001s)]
*  is a bonus when it comes to my credibility. Now, everybody has zero doubt about where I stand [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=798.2800000000001s)]
*  and they can filter everything I say through the appropriate lens. What typically happens in [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=803.64s)]
*  journalism is they say they have no bias and then they just work it out in the printed word or on [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=807.72s)]
*  their shows without owning it. But the audience knows it and it creates a distrust and a divide. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=813.88s)]
*  Okay. Two, just two points as an addendum and then we'll get into it. So I went on in the one answer [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=821.8s)]
*  and I, she did find I have no problem with the way the times edited the interview. This is not a Ben [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=827.56s)]
*  Smith situation where I just thought he just tried to hammer me for his own reasons. She was very [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=832.6s)]
*  fair, but I just want to say that, and that one answer where I'm like that what I have a problem [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=838.2s)]
*  with is these people who will go after Donald Trump and play holier than now when covering him, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=843.08s)]
*  but will bury the allegations against Democrats. And what I said at the end of that, because we [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=850.5200000000001s)]
*  have a transcript of it was like, I didn't see a lot of questions by the times or anyone else [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=854.84s)]
*  about why Doug Emhoff allegedly wailed on his ex-girlfriend, the one he dated right before [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=860.0400000000001s)]
*  Kamala. Where was the deep investigation into whether he fathered a love child with the nanny [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=864.84s)]
*  and why the ambulance came to her home on the night she lost the baby. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=869.48s)]
*  Nobody cared about that. I've actually reported on both of those stories, which is something about [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=872.68s)]
*  two reporters in America can say. And then added just a bit later when she was like, I don't get [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=877.3199999999999s)]
*  how you can go out and endorse this guy, understanding he's going to make mistakes. He's [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=883.88s)]
*  going to do things that are wrong. Who you know, she says, will have to be criticized because that's [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=888.36s)]
*  the nature of any political leader. And I said, you know, see, to me, it's funny to hear you ask that [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=893.16s)]
*  because I guarantee you my audience is going to laugh at this question because they're going to [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=898.84s)]
*  say that is rich coming from the New York times, which did more to run cover for Joe Biden than [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=903.72s)]
*  virtually anyone else in media. I don't run cover for Donald Trump. I've ripped on Trump endless [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=908.44s)]
*  numbers of times. I put my record of ripping on Trump up against the record of anybody in the [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=913.72s)]
*  leftist media of running against Joe Biden or calling out his infirmities. Even when Trump was [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=918.76s)]
*  running, one of the reasons why he attacked me after I hosted a presidential debate that he did [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=924.76s)]
*  not participate in is because I raised questions about Trump's mental acuity. And I had noticed he [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=928.36s)]
*  was having some word slips saying the wrong thing about Obama when he met Biden, World War III, [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=933.16s)]
*  when he meant to, and he got mad and he attacked me, which is totally fair game. I am fair game. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=938.28s)]
*  I'm in the arena and I'm fair game. I'm not above getting attacked by him. I wasn't in 15. I'm not [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=943.88s)]
*  in 25. So to me, it's funny to hear you ask that question because you must not listen to the show [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=949.8000000000001s)]
*  that often. Okay. So having said all that, Emily, your thoughts? [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=956.36s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, that was a part of the interview that you just played that I was trying [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=961.48s)]
*  to like stand up and clap when I was listening because it was such a great explanation of what [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=964.28s)]
*  people are doing now and where the wires are exactly getting crossed, which is that I actually [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=968.84s)]
*  think a lot of even thoughtful people who are coming to this conversation in good faith, like [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=973.8000000000001s)]
*  I genuinely think she was don't totally watch the programs that they're engaging with enough [[00:16:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=979.0s)]
*  to understand what's really happening and what the relationship is with the audience, because [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=986.36s)]
*  your audience would hear the question that you just read out and say, what do you mean? Like, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=990.52s)]
*  of course, Megan has to criticize. It doesn't matter that Megan went and endorsed Donald Trump. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=995.16s)]
*  She's been criticizing him like three days later. It just is a complete, and a lot of times it's [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=999.96s)]
*  from these soundbites that go viral is when people who don't regularly listen to a show will dip in. [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1006.12s)]
*  And so they kind of think that they understand what happens, but it's really totally different. [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1012.36s)]
*  Like your relationship with the audience is totally different than somebody who genuinely [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1017.4s)]
*  doesn't listen to it every day, fully understands, or even like three times a week understands. And [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1020.44s)]
*  that is where I think she thought that you were working with the campaign, cooperating with the [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1027.32s)]
*  campaign, that you were a part of the campaign because you gave that speech when in fact all you [[00:17:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1035.08s)]
*  did was be more honest with your audience than a lot of the journalists who are even just straight [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1040.04s)]
*  news reporters who work in their desk at the White House and absolutely know that they're voting for [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1044.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris, come to every question, believing Kamala Harris good, Donald Trump bad. Every time [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1049.56s)]
*  they sit down and write copy, you're just being honest with your audience. And that's an improvement [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1054.6799999999998s)]
*  for most Americans. Yeah, Eliana, this is what I was trying to say to her. Like, [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1059.56s)]
*  like basically you guys at the Times are not fooling anyone. Everyone knows that you're leftist [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1063.4s)]
*  and everyone who listens to this show knows I'm more on the right. And in owning it and just [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1071.64s)]
*  expressly saying, this is what I'm going to do in the ballot box and this is what I think you should [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1078.8400000000001s)]
*  do. It's really not, it's, it's not as big a transgression off of where we used to be as she [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1082.76s)]
*  would have us believe. Like there's no one in America who thinks the majority of New York Times [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1089.08s)]
*  staffers voted Trump. I think that was a really important part of the conversation. And [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1094.6s)]
*  look, for 20 plus years, you know, you could trace it back to Dan Rather in 2004, but even before that, [[00:18:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1105.48s)]
*  when we had these experiences with titans of supposedly neutral purveyors of the news, [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1114.2s)]
*  who claimed to be one thing, and then there were scandals that showed them to be operating in the [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1122.2s)]
*  service of one political party. And so your statement that, hey, disclosing your biases [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1127.64s)]
*  upfront actually builds trust with an audience rather than undermining it or undermining one's [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1134.1200000000001s)]
*  credibility was I think really important. And what I think that the Times often misses is that [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1141.0s)]
*  our problem with them, you know, our frustration with them, and I say this from the beacon all the [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1147.48s)]
*  time, like the beacon, we say we're conservative, like we, we own that. And our problem with you [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1154.2s)]
*  is that you claim to be down the middle and we know you're something else. And that is what has [[00:19:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1161.72s)]
*  broken trust with audiences and readers. So when you don't cover Doug Emhoff and the scandals [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1166.6s)]
*  surrounding him, that's trust breaking. If you were to come out and say, like, hey, we don't cover [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1174.4399999999998s)]
*  scandals about Democrats because it undercuts our political priors or our mission here. It's going [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1181.32s)]
*  to piss off our readers. Like, okay, we'd be fine with that. It's the posturing that you're fair. [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1186.76s)]
*  Yes, right. Just own it. I don't understand why it's lazy and as they don't. [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1192.44s)]
*  You know, but it's, that is why there's this wide open space for people like you and Joe Rogan and [[00:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1198.6000000000001s)]
*  others to go build these huge audiences because they're not fooling people. Well, Megan, they're [[00:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1204.76s)]
*  just breaking trust with people. Can I answer why they don't? I think that's actually a really [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1210.1200000000001s)]
*  interesting part of this because I believe that you could fix trust in media tomorrow if the New [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1213.88s)]
*  York Times and even the good faith people, like there's maybe 10% of journalists can genuinely be [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1220.04s)]
*  neutral and don't have like significant biases in one direction or the other. You can't tell it in [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1224.84s)]
*  their copy. Like there are some people who can do that, but they're very, very rare. But the New [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1229.48s)]
*  York Times and the Washington Post just came out tomorrow and said, our reporting, not our [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1233.1599999999999s)]
*  editorial side, our reporting leans left. The vast majority of our reporters are liberal. We think, [[00:20:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1238.52s)]
*  you know, maybe they put one of those signs in this house, we believe X, Y, and Z outside of [[00:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1243.32s)]
*  the New York Times. They would fix trust with their audience like right off the bat because they do [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1247.72s)]
*  some genuinely decent reporting. Just tell us what you think. But the reason they can't do that is [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1252.76s)]
*  that they are all in these cultural bubbles where they don't understand that their biases are biases. [[00:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1257.72s)]
*  They think this is just a matter of human rights or decency or civility, but they don't understand [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1264.0400000000002s)]
*  that actually those are significant biases in one direction or the other. So they're in such a bubble [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1269.96s)]
*  that they're not even able to determine anymore what's a bias and what's actually just things [[00:21:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1274.68s)]
*  that are still controversial and contentious outside of their little bubbles and what's [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1281.4s)]
*  actually just something that's a point of consensus that we all agree on. They can't tell one from the [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1286.3600000000001s)]
*  other because they're so siloed in what Charles Murray called super sips, New York, Washington, [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1290.44s)]
*  D.C., L.A., where upper middle class educated people disproportionately cluster and are [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1296.1200000000001s)]
*  disproportionately powerful. They can't even tell anymore. Yeah, okay. So I've had these debates [[00:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1301.4s)]
*  online and the audience knows I love Sasha Stone. She has a great substack, Free Thinking Through [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1307.16s)]
*  the Fourth Turning, which she turns into a podcast and I love she's been on the program. [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1313.3200000000002s)]
*  But she asked this online recently and I took a stab at answering it and we had like a back and [[00:21:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1317.48s)]
*  forth on it. But she was asking like I'm going to screw it up. But it was basically why are they [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1321.88s)]
*  doing this? Like why did they do this to us? They continue to pretend that they're neutral and we [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1326.84s)]
*  know they're not. And I said they genuinely believe they're neutral. Like they're not like [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1333.32s)]
*  I'm biased and I don't want anyone to find out, Eliana. They're like no, we are the truthful ones. [[00:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1341.24s)]
*  Like we are the gatekeepers. You know, like what is life going to be like if there are no rules? [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1349.4s)]
*  And in fact, she and I kind of got into this too. She's like, you know, what does that look like? [[00:22:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1358.2800000000002s)]
*  You know, where the rules are out the window. And here's a little bit of that in SOT5. [[00:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1362.1200000000001s)]
*  I think you're right that there is some way that we are seeing things or discussing something [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1369.0800000000002s)]
*  different, right? I guess what I'm trying to understand is what are the rules of this new [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1376.92s)]
*  world that you are inhabiting? Are you sort of making them up as you go along and you're [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1381.0s)]
*  sort of seeing what it is or do you adhere to some of those old values that you used to embrace? [[00:23:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1385.8000000000002s)]
*  The only way one succeeds in this medium is by violating all those rules that we used to have in [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1390.1200000000001s)]
*  journalism where you don't really talk about yourself at all. You don't talk about your [[00:23:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1397.16s)]
*  opinions. You might have a bias. Your only goal is to hide it, not to own it and then get past [[00:23:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1401.96s)]
*  it with the audience. It's just a whole new world and it's okay. We used to be much more partisan [[00:23:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1407.72s)]
*  and openly partisan in our journalism and our media, you know, a hundred plus years ago and we [[00:23:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1413.48s)]
*  survived that just fine. And we will survive this just fine too. What the audience wants from me [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1419.48s)]
*  is my authentic self and no filter. What they can smell from a mile away is a phony. [[00:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1425.8s)]
*  So they have no problem with me endorsing Trump, even if they don't like Trump. What they would [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1432.2s)]
*  have a problem with is me pretending I don't have a horse in the race and going out and trying to [[00:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1437.48s)]
*  deliver the news as though I'm completely objective and I'm just as open-minded to Kamala as I am to [[00:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1443.88s)]
*  Donald Trump. And the secret addendum to that, Eliana, is that is not only actually the rule [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1450.28s)]
*  for me in new media, it's actually the rule for you too, Lulu. It's actually the rule for everyone. [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1459.72s)]
*  You just haven't realized it yet. [[00:24:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1467.96s)]
*  I mean, look, I think there's some truth to the idea that they don't realize they're biased, [[00:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1472.28s)]
*  but I'm not totally sure that's the case. I mean, when you have the CEO of NPR testifying [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1479.08s)]
*  before Congress and saying, yes, we're 87 Democrats and zero Republicans, like it does sort of defy [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1489.08s)]
*  logic that they can truly believe that doesn't actually show up in any of the news coverage. [[00:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1495.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. I mean, and not to mention, like, do you believe this country is about black plunder? [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1502.8400000000001s)]
*  Right. [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1510.04s)]
*  That woman, right? But I genuinely believe that woman is there. I don't remember ever tweeting [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1510.2s)]
*  that, but that sounds right. I genuinely believe that woman took to the congressional seat last [[00:25:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1517.8s)]
*  week and was like, I'm not biased and NPR is not biased. We check our bias. There's a legit wall [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1524.2s)]
*  between me and the actual reporters at NPR, Emily, and that protects us. And then when you [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1531.32s)]
*  ask the follow-up question, we're like, what about the people on the other side of that wall? What [[00:25:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1538.6s)]
*  have you done to satisfy yourself that they're not just like you? And reflecting those biases [[00:25:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1542.2s)]
*  in their reporting, it's like the monkey with the see no evil, hear no evil, speak like, I know nothing. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1547.48s)]
*  Seriously. And I think actually Eliana's point is a legitimate one. And one thing you hear from the [[00:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1554.4399999999998s)]
*  media a lot when you point out those discrepancies is they will say, okay, but it's because, like, [[00:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1559.96s)]
*  look at Donald Trump. It's because Republicans don't have as many serious people to put forth [[00:26:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1565.48s)]
*  that aren't trafficking and disinformation. That's always the excuse, right? But they don't even [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1572.2s)]
*  understand sometimes that, like, they don't, they're completely out of the loop. They dismiss as [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1577.0s)]
*  conspiracy theories. Often when Republicans point out the lies or the pattern of lies that certain [[00:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1582.68s)]
*  Democrats have told, because again, they will categorically say it's not serious if it's coming [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1589.08s)]
*  from the Federalist. It's not serious if it's coming from Ben Shapiro. So they don't even [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1594.4399999999998s)]
*  understand. Like, they're not even able to make those equivalencies. You know, they say, well, [[00:26:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1598.84s)]
*  of course, we don't platform as many Republicans as we do Democrats. Republicans have an endemic [[00:26:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1603.0s)]
*  truth problem. And it's like, you weren't covering, for example, Biden, as you started with, Megan, [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1607.48s)]
*  like, every, the White House was suddenly talking about how these were, quote, cheap fakes. And you [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1612.84s)]
*  guys literally, like, reprinted their press releases for several weeks until the debate, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1617.96s)]
*  and you couldn't do it anymore. There's certain storylines like Tara Reid. There's certain [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1622.76s)]
*  storylines that they just check out of because they assume it's all the public information. [[00:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1628.04s)]
*  How many people, literally, how many people in America can say that they've interviewed [[00:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1631.48s)]
*  both Trump accusers on the sexual assault or harassment front and Tara Reid? I literally, [[00:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1636.44s)]
*  I might be the only one. Like, the New York Times cannot say that. You know, that's what I was [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1642.8400000000001s)]
*  trying to say to her. Like, there was another part that didn't make the dance where I said, look, [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1647.16s)]
*  to me, it's funny, you know, that you're asking this about me and how I can maintain my ability [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1654.2s)]
*  to criticize him notwithstanding my endorsement because I wrote, I said, this is the sin of which [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1658.3600000000001s)]
*  the left is guilty. You know, like, no one on the left can really ask this question. You're asking [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1664.2s)]
*  me. There are very few who actually do raise these questions on their own side and who are willing to [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1669.88s)]
*  go after Kamala and Joe Biden or Barack Obama or God forbid, Michelle Obama in the way I go after [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1675.56s)]
*  the right and Trump. They just won't do it. If you listen to my show, you listen for a week, [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1682.44s)]
*  you'll have multiple examples of me raising questions about the way Trump has done something [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1687.56s)]
*  or his team has done something. But I don't have TDS. I can see the good he does very clearly. [[00:28:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1692.12s)]
*  And I have no problem giving him credit for the wins. After that, she said, I'll say that [[00:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1698.6s)]
*  Ezra Klein, one of my colleagues was one of the earliest people to call for Biden to drop out of [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1704.68s)]
*  the race. And I said, where was the Times editorial doing that at any point prior to the debate? [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1709.8s)]
*  That was also January. I mean, that was that was January. Like this, [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1716.44s)]
*  that could have been saying that he's old. Ezra Klein was saying Biden's too old. He wasn't saying [[00:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1720.28s)]
*  he's lost it. You know, he's like, oh, he's too old to be president. And, you know, she said, oh, [[00:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1725.8s)]
*  well, I said, where was that? Where's the Times editorial doing that before that debate? She said, [[00:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1730.2s)]
*  well, the editorial pages, as you know, are different than the news pages. And I said, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1735.48s)]
*  where was the news coverage? Where was the news coverage? Where was Peter Baker documenting the [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1739.64s)]
*  fact that these brain doctors had been to the White House 10 times over the prior year? And she said, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1744.52s)]
*  I'm not going to litigate the Times coverage. And I understood she was not there to defend the New [[00:29:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1749.48s)]
*  York Times, which I totally get. Like she wasn't sent to me to come on my show as a representative [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1753.32s)]
*  of the Times and to defend them. She's like, I'm trying to do a nice profile of you, lady. [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1758.52s)]
*  Why do you keep attacking me? I was basically saying, you can't ask me how I could possibly [[00:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1763.16s)]
*  be fair to Trump notwithstanding my endorsement. When you're the New York Times, you just can't do [[00:29:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1771.72s)]
*  it. And here's, let me explain to you why you can't do it. That's sort of where we were going, Emily. [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1776.44s)]
*  Yeah. No, and that's a really good point. And to me, it's just like, some of these lines, [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1781.24s)]
*  some of these, like they actually is a good example about the cheap fakes, because it's not [[00:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1789.08s)]
*  just what their editorial writers, their columnists were saying. I mean, your point is that the straight [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1793.48s)]
*  news coverage is shot through with the bias that should be on the editorial side. If there were [[00:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1799.32s)]
*  this traditional neutral firewall, which just doesn't really exist, nobody believes that it [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1805.32s)]
*  exists. They will tell you in our newsroom every day, there's no overlap, but they believe roughly [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1810.2s)]
*  the same things. Even if there's little debates, they believe roughly the same thing. So why wasn't [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1815.56s)]
*  there the Peter Baker stories? That's the question we need to have answered about the White House [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1821.8s)]
*  having doctors coming in and out of it, about donors being upset when they saw him in person. [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1827.0800000000002s)]
*  Those stories were nowhere to be found. Instead, it was the cheap fake storyline. [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1832.76s)]
*  It's not just the Times. We're picking on them because I sat with them, but NPR with her little [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1837.0s)]
*  firewall, those NPR reporters weren't running around covering the Joe Biden mental acuity [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1842.04s)]
*  problems. And you all saw last week and when it happened what they did with the Hunter Biden laptop. [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1847.4s)]
*  Like we're not interested. Our viewers aren't interested in that fake news story. That's the [[00:30:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1852.3600000000001s)]
*  problem. Neither the editorial nor the journalism side is open-minded to any bad news to Democrats [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1856.92s)]
*  that doesn't dovetail with their worldview. If a Democrat works with a Republican, they might do [[00:31:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1863.8s)]
*  a negative story on him, right? But they're not going to cover things that could actually [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1869.08s)]
*  undermine Joe Biden's chances of reelection in an honest way. And everyone knows it. That's what I [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1873.6399999999999s)]
*  was trying to say. You go back 150 years in this country, we used to be very partisan, that so-called [[00:31:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1879.08s)]
*  yellow journalism period. People used to pick up different rags to read and they would completely [[00:31:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1884.44s)]
*  affirm their worldview on the right and the left. And that's how life was. And we did just fine. [[00:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1888.84s)]
*  And if we're in a country where you're quote siloed that way, it's okay. The reality is we [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1893.32s)]
*  already are there. That is where we already are. We're just pretending in the so-called mainstream [[00:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1898.1999999999998s)]
*  that we're not, that those are still our gatekeepers. All right. Moving [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1904.52s)]
*  past that particular subject, I do want to show this. So we did get into [[00:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1908.76s)]
*  my long history with Trump, Eliana and me asking him that question at the debate. [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1913.6399999999999s)]
*  And then he came after me and she raised a question that a lot of the left cannot, [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1918.1999999999998s)]
*  and even some on the right who don't love Trump, cannot understand. They can't understand how I, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1923.4799999999998s)]
*  or frankly, anyone who doesn't totally endorse the way Donald Trump has behaved his entire life, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1933.0s)]
*  or with respect to us or an individual like let's say John McCain or the Gold Star families in the [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1940.12s)]
*  first race and so on, can come around to supporting him. This is a genuine inability to understand. [[00:32:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1944.92s)]
*  Please explain to me how you can endorse that man. And we got into E. Jean Carroll. You heard me [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1952.68s)]
*  saying there, I don't believe her, but we expanded it just a bit and sought to. [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1958.1200000000001s)]
*  I do think he's taken inappropriate liberties with women and gotten handsy with them in a way he's [[00:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1962.92s)]
*  owned himself. Okay. Years ago when he was a celebrity and it is what it is, that's the past. [[00:32:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1970.12s)]
*  But it's just about so much more than that. We are talking about how many people dying at the [[00:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1977.9599999999998s)]
*  southern border because of the invasion that we've suffered under Joe Biden. We're talking about [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1983.9599999999998s)]
*  Ligand Riley, whose killer was led in under Biden. We put him on a taxpayer flight down to Georgia [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1990.12s)]
*  where he murdered her. I don't give a shit about Trump getting handsy with somebody 20 years ago. [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=1995.08s)]
*  I want someone who will close the border, which he has. I want someone who will keep boys out of my [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2001.8s)]
*  daughter's sports, which he has. I want someone who will stand up to the insane DEI policies so that [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2007.08s)]
*  white kids will stop hearing in school that they're born with some original sin from which they [[00:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2014.04s)]
*  cannot recover, which he has. And I mean that right there, Eliana, [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2018.68s)]
*  that just sums up why so many of us happily, gleefully, hopefully, and just [[00:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2027.48s)]
*  optimistically pulled the lever for Donald Trump in November and remain really grateful to him for [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2035.3200000000002s)]
*  the agenda he is unleashing. Anybody on the left still obsessing about Trump and like [[00:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2041.64s)]
*  E. Jean Carroll or when he was a celebrity? It's just people are dying. [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2049.6400000000003s)]
*  Young women are being killed. Young women are being hurt on the sports fields. Have some perspective. [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2058.12s)]
*  I actually don't think that that question was about Trump, Megan. I think it was about you. [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2064.6800000000003s)]
*  And I think the question was put to you such that it really was, how can you, Megan Kelly, [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2070.68s)]
*  who talk a lot about how about who position yourself as pro woman, who talk a bit about how [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2077.7999999999997s)]
*  to have a real career and build a family, who are certainly, you know, you're certainly not a [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2087.3999999999996s)]
*  wilting violet, how can you have that identity, which is very much a public identity, and, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2092.92s)]
*  you know, vote for this scumbag, endorse this scumbag when you have been publicly mistreated [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2102.52s)]
*  on the basis of your, you know, lady parts, like it made them a subject of conversation. [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2108.6000000000004s)]
*  So I took that to be about you and like, you know, a sort of tacit attempt to undermine, [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2115.6400000000003s)]
*  you know, your credibility on that issue. And I actually thought it was an interesting conversation [[00:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2120.52s)]
*  because it gets to issues that like all voters confront, which are like, what are lesser and more [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2125.72s)]
*  important issues to me that I'm going to vote on? And you basically said, like, look, he may have [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2131.0s)]
*  mistreated me personally, like it was a micro and macro thing, but that's just less important to me [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2137.56s)]
*  than other issues the nation is confronting, on which I think he's going to perform much better [[00:35:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2144.28s)]
*  than she would have. Like, it's just, and I do think there's like an inability on the left to [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2151.6400000000003s)]
*  get beyond like, well, he mistreated you, how can that not be the main issue that you're going to [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2158.6000000000004s)]
*  vote on? Yeah, that's right. And I think it's a feeling that the left has in general on Trump, [[00:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2163.1600000000003s)]
*  and they did include this piece in the interview where she said, what do you think of Trump [[00:36:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2169.8s)]
*  dismissing the media as enemy the people on fake news? Oh, and let me add, Megan, like, [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2175.48s)]
*  we saw Democrats do this with Bill Clinton all the time. It was like, oh, whatever, you know, [[00:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2179.7200000000003s)]
*  he got a handsy with an intern in the Oval Office, but like, he's doing a lot of great things. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2185.1600000000003s)]
*  And I think that's like a perfectly fair argument to make. Like, yeah, that's fine. You know, [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2190.44s)]
*  and conservatives issue with him was he was he lied under oath. But by the same token, I think [[00:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2196.6s)]
*  it is fine for for conservatives to say, like, we don't care that much about his personal conduct [[00:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2201.72s)]
*  from 10 or 20 years ago, we don't think that he, you know, never lies, but he's doing things that [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2207.56s)]
*  we think are a lot more important. Well, and it's like you look over at the other side, it's like, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2213.96s)]
*  well, if I vote for Kamala, I could bring in a party that has had a president office who did [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2219.4s)]
*  more than get handsy with an intern. I mean, he was getting blowjobs from her at the Oval. [[00:37:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2225.64s)]
*  And while he was married, by the way, fine. Okay. And then the woman who was running is married to [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2229.96s)]
*  a guy who's been credibly accused as an abuser, a woman abuser, which the left wouldn't even cover. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2236.2799999999997s)]
*  And so it's like, okay, no one is ideal. Like, most of these characters who wind up running for [[00:37:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2243.64s)]
*  office are ideal. Maybe Mitt Romney was ideal, except for the weird dog stuff. But his policies [[00:37:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2248.92s)]
*  weren't ideal. His policies didn't speak to the Republican base. Go ahead. [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2253.48s)]
*  This came up in the Hegseth nomination too, where I can't remember which senator asked him, like, [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2257.96s)]
*  were you unfaithful to your wife and suggested that that disqualified him from being the secretary [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2262.68s)]
*  of defense. Was that Tim Kaine? I can't remember who it was, but it was like, are you serious, man? [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2269.08s)]
*  Right. I mean, you ran with Hillary Clinton. Look around this room for a hot second. You ran for [[00:37:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2277.2400000000002s)]
*  president with Hillary Clinton. How many of these United States senators have been unfaithful to [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2281.4s)]
*  their spouses, but there is this, I think, instinct on the left to say, like, these matters of personal [[00:38:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2286.36s)]
*  conduct, which frankly, the country is so far beyond. Like, you really left that behind. [[00:38:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2293.1600000000003s)]
*  But ironically, I have to say in the left's defense, they got that from the right. You know, [[00:38:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2298.2000000000003s)]
*  the right used to be the more judgmental, like, nobody who's had an affair, that party. It wasn't [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2302.2000000000003s)]
*  until Trump came along that that was completely busted open. Remember the story in 15, how can [[00:38:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2307.0s)]
*  evangelicals get behind this guy, this Randy celebrity, handsy, right? Yeah. Well, also Trump [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2312.04s)]
*  was the first person to like first high profile person to understand this about American politics, [[00:38:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2321.88s)]
*  because the Tim Kaine example is fantastic, at least on the right, that is to say, he brought [[00:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2327.16s)]
*  the Clinton accusers to the debate and put them in like the front row back in 2016. It was genius, [[00:38:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2332.2s)]
*  truly genius, because he recognized that his voters and people who could be persuadable [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2339.64s)]
*  to his side, the most important thing he could do was to show that Hillary Clinton does not have [[00:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2345.96s)]
*  the moral high ground when she criticizes his character. And that's what the entire stunt was [[00:39:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2352.3599999999997s)]
*  proving is the emperor is wearing no clothes. And as soon as you can prove that Trump realizes he [[00:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2358.2s)]
*  can compete on the policy grounds, but it's convincing those persuadables that there is no [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2363.56s)]
*  moral high ground among his critics. And that's absolutely true. It's proven to be true over and [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2368.68s)]
*  over again. It's funny because there was another point at which she and I discussed Trump and his [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2373.3999999999996s)]
*  attacks on the media. And I was saying, like, why are we pretending that we're just like these [[00:39:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2378.7599999999998s)]
*  little butterflies that can't have the wings plucked off? Like, we're tough, we can take, [[00:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2383.48s)]
*  it's fine. Who cares, basically, what Trump says? Yes, he's demonizing the news media. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2387.6400000000003s)]
*  The whole point would be not to lean in, right? Like, try to maintain your objectivity and [[00:39:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2394.44s)]
*  disprove the accusations. You look at a place like CNN, that's where they went wrong. Jeff Zucker was [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2402.36s)]
*  like, Oh, he's actually giving me ideas to be an enemy of the people to be fake news. Yes, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2408.04s)]
*  that's how I'll drive my ratings up. Yeah. Put your head down and do your job. [[00:40:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2413.32s)]
*  That's it. That's it. We don't have to spend any time really thinking about his names that he's [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2421.16s)]
*  calling us. Just do just do the work and try to be fair and try not to have TDS. Okay, so overall, [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2425.8s)]
*  I think the times for what I thought was a fair interview, I liked Lulu. If I see her again, [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2432.44s)]
*  I think it'll be friendly. And I think, you know, there was some value to getting in front of the [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2436.84s)]
*  Times audience, which by the way, is having a meltdown over the whole interview. If you look at [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2443.0s)]
*  the comments on the Times' YouTube feed, they're so unhappy. They're so mad that I don't believe [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2447.1600000000003s)]
*  Eugene Carroll. I don't believe her at all. Not one word. Women don't run around laughing about [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2452.6800000000003s)]
*  their rapes. And by the way, she can't even remember what year it happened. Please give me a break. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2458.76s)]
*  I'll buy you Paris, Rachel. That is not a rape survivor. Okay. Anyway, [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2464.68s)]
*  I thank the Times for the interview and I thought it was actually a very good conversation. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2471.7999999999997s)]
*  And I'll just add one addendum to Ben Smith of Semaphore. That's the kind of conversation you [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2475.8799999999997s)]
*  and I could have had if you had just asked probative, like open questions to try to get [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2480.7599999999998s)]
*  it where media is right now. Like she and I actually plowed new ground to have sort of somebody [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2485.64s)]
*  from the legacy media talking to somebody like me who was of that world, but now is in the new. [[00:41:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2490.92s)]
*  It was an interesting conversation because she was open-minded and she was honest about like where [[00:41:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2496.44s)]
*  she was, you know, not getting it. And like that, we advanced the ball. That's, that's how [[00:41:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2501.32s)]
*  interviews should be done. So thumbs up. And I encourage everybody to go listen to it. It's [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2506.92s)]

*  I can't remember who it was, but it was like a couple of guys out there in Silicon Valley who [[00:44:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2666.76s)]
*  were not great. And so we interviewed her and we interviewed a bunch of women who were kind of [[00:44:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2669.88s)]
*  complaining. And so that's the foot on which we got off, which I would say is a leftist foot, [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2674.2s)]
*  right? Like she met me doing a more left leaning story and therefore she liked me, [[00:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2679.24s)]
*  right? Because it's like, great, you're a woman of the right, but you're open minded to sexual [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2683.9599999999996s)]
*  harassment claims. So let's go. Well, we maintained an occasional correspondence via text, etc. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2689.4799999999996s)]
*  And I met her like once or twice for a drink. And I have to say, like we got along, she's a very tough, [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2695.8799999999997s)]
*  ballsy, openly lesbian woman. And that's fine. I actually have a fair amount of friends who are [[00:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2703.56s)]
*  LGBT. LGBT. And that is great that whatever, I've got absolutely no issues there. As you know, [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2710.52s)]
*  we stop at the T. Anyway, so how did things go south? Well, let me play the soundbite first, [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2720.04s)]
*  and then I'll tell you how. Here's her. [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2727.8799999999997s)]
*  Megan Kelly is launching a podcast network. Lots of people are doing this. MK Media launching [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2729.64s)]
*  next month will have shows from Mark Halperin, Maureen Callahan, and Link Lauren. I think the [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2733.88s)]
*  company she's worked with was sold to Fox, the red, whatever you call it. Let's listen to what [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2739.4s)]
*  Megan has to say about this. So excited about these three. Are these a great three to launch with? [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2744.84s)]
*  They cover the gamut, right? It's like, Link has got such a following amongst young, sort of right [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2751.16s)]
*  leaning people or independent minded people who have just had it with the weird left. [[00:45:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2757.56s)]
*  Anyway, her podcast, which launched in 2020, I was one of the first people to talk to her about [[00:46:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2762.44s)]
*  doing a podcast, as I've said before, is consistently one of the most popular news [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2766.36s)]
*  podcasts in the country. I don't know if it's news exactly. You're kinder to her than her. I think [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2770.52s)]
*  she's just a rage machine and she has a little act that she takes on the road and screams at women, [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2774.84s)]
*  a lot of women. But the idea of what's happening here is a bigger thing is there's a lot of really [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2779.32s)]
*  interesting independent companies being created, whether they're on conservative or liberal. [[00:46:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2784.52s)]
*  And it really is this idea of doing these podcasts networks is going to be really interesting in how [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2789.4s)]
*  you do them and keep them entrepreneurial. I know Scott and I have talked about it, [[00:46:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2794.28s)]
*  especially the voices on the weird left, like ourselves, what is wrong with her? [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2798.52s)]
*  What is wrong is I see you and I hear you and I see how nasty you are to everybody. [[00:46:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2805.64s)]
*  I love that she calls me a rage machine. She is literally known for like walking away with [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2811.0s)]
*  people's balls. It's a mystery in Silicon Valley why people continue to sit down with her. Elon [[00:46:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2815.08s)]
*  hates her guts. All she does is rip on Elon night and day. If you are an executive in Silicon Valley [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2820.8399999999997s)]
*  that sits with her, you know she's going to try to leave with your jugular. That's what she's known [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2826.4399999999996s)]
*  for. By the way, I will put my record of protecting women up against Kara Swishers any day of the week. [[00:47:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2830.6s)]
*  In fact, I can't think of a single thing Kara Swishers ever done for women at all, except what? [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2837.96s)]
*  Support abortion rights. That's probably what she's thinking. But I'll tell you how things went wrong. [[00:47:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2843.7200000000003s)]
*  When I and she's right. She did encourage me to launch the podcast. I remember her. She sent me [[00:47:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2850.36s)]
*  a text that said something like the lesbians are for it because she was seeing a bunch of [[00:47:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2854.52s)]
*  either lesbian podcasters or just friends that she was after a drink we had. And I appreciated [[00:47:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2860.52s)]
*  that. Now, honestly, I was very open minded to Kara Swisher and understood our policies are [[00:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2865.08s)]
*  very different. But you know, I have a lot of friends who are on the other side of the aisle and [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2870.04s)]
*  would never make those the stakes of a relationship. You know where things went south was [[00:47:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2873.96s)]
*  she didn't like my COVID commentary once I actually did launch the podcast, either on the show or on [[00:47:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2878.92s)]
*  X or the which was then Twitter. And I was pointing out that young people were getting myocarditis, [[00:48:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2886.2s)]
*  especially young teenage men and dying and suffering the world over as a result of these [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2894.2s)]
*  vaccines. And it wasn't being disclosed. And I was citing Dr. Vinay Prasad, who was way ahead on [[00:48:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2901.08s)]
*  this issue was having pediatric cardiologists on his show and talking about it. She didn't like [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2907.16s)]
*  that. None of the left like that. And unfortunately, she invited me to go on her podcast. And I agreed. [[00:48:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2912.04s)]
*  That's not the unfortunate part. I said, fine, I'll do it. I was fine. I'm fine mixing it up with [[00:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2920.52s)]
*  people. I was scheduled to go on I think on a Tuesday or a Wednesday. And the previous Friday, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2925.72s)]
*  so like five days prior, my sister died. My sister unexpectedly had a heart attack and died at age [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2934.92s)]
*  58. And I had Abby text her assistant say, MK has had something personal happen, something personal [[00:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2943.88s)]
*  came up. And she's not going to be able to make it. This is five days in advance, but I knew very [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2952.36s)]
*  well I wasn't going to be doing anybody's podcast. And she responded, not the assistant, she responded [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2956.84s)]
*  and said, Oh, that sounds like a good idea. And I certainly hope she'll stay off X in the meantime. [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2965.32s)]
*  So her instinct was to question, right, like, why I was doing it, like she wasn't really accepting [[00:49:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2974.6s)]
*  that it was a personal thing that had happened to me. She thought I was trying to avoid her [[00:49:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2980.2000000000003s)]
*  because I was on X saying controversial things that she was. She was objecting to, and that I [[00:49:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2984.84s)]
*  didn't I wasn't, you know, strong enough to go on Kara Swisher's podcast. Again, like somebody who [[00:49:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2991.6400000000003s)]
*  doesn't fucking know me at all, right, like I'm afraid of having somebody asked me tough questions [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=2996.76s)]
*  or mixing it up. And Abby responded by saying, actually, her sister died. And she writes back, [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3002.04s)]
*  Oh, well, I was only joking. I was only joking, you know, sorry. I'm sorry, but she's a bad person. [[00:50:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3011.72s)]
*  That's you're a bad person. Did she ever send me a note? Did she ever say like, I'm so sorry [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3018.92s)]
*  about your sister? Or like, the last correspondence we had had was sure, I'd be happy to come on your [[00:50:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3024.44s)]
*  podcast. Then she shits on me to my assistant and finds out that she's a shit that I've had a death [[00:50:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3029.8s)]
*  in the family, someone close to me. And does she say politics don't matter? I'm going to shoot her [[00:50:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3037.0800000000004s)]
*  a note. You know, we've had these drinks. I helped her whatever. No, she's she says, Oh, I was only [[00:50:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3042.6000000000004s)]
*  joking. She has to cover her own ass because she knows she's now made herself look terrible. [[00:50:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3048.28s)]
*  And from that point forward, all she's done is rip on me. And frankly, vice versa. I mean, [[00:50:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3055.4s)]
*  I just see her very differently. Now. I think she's a bad person. I think there's a there's a kind [[00:50:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3059.64s)]
*  of person that cannot put politics to the side. She liked me when she thought I was a me too loving [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3064.2s)]
*  NBC News employee. And once she realized I wasn't, that I really am more conservative in my worldview, [[00:51:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3071.8s)]
*  that I would question the COVID vaccines, that suddenly I was too scared to go on with Kara [[00:51:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3080.84s)]
*  Swisher and must be in bad faith and saying I can't make it after all, and not revealing in [[00:51:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3087.1600000000003s)]
*  the first email my personal tragedy, which Abby would never do without my permission anyway. [[00:51:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3093.56s)]
*  To me, this just shows what we're up against. And now she's out there like she's a rage machine. [[00:51:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3100.84s)]
*  And what is she talking about? Weird left talking about you, Kara, you, you need to make an [[00:51:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3105.7200000000003s)]
*  examination of yourself and your own heart. Okay. Any thoughts on that? [[00:51:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3110.92s)]
*  Well, I mean, she's just the combination. She has a combination that's really, I think, dangerous, [[00:51:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3116.92s)]
*  which is sanctimonious and close minded. And when you combine those two things, it's really toxic [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3122.28s)]
*  and it makes for very unhappy people. And I think very unappealing media personalities. And so [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3128.92s)]
*  I'm not entirely surprised by this, but it's just, I think there's a type of journalist who [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3135.56s)]
*  gets validation and sort of the moral affirmations of commentary. And I think unfortunately, she's [[00:52:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3141.08s)]
*  one of those people and it's very dangerous. Yeah. I don't, it's just like, I'm so over it. [[00:52:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3146.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't know. Eliana, you've been like openly conservative for a long time. Like, do you have [[00:52:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3152.12s)]
*  friends on the left? Do you maintain friendships? Do they make politics the stakes? [[00:52:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3156.2s)]
*  You know, it's an interesting question. I've always found like when I worked at Politico and [[00:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3163.24s)]
*  when I was a contributor at CNN and even in college and that sort of left, left wing environment, [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3169.3999999999996s)]
*  I found if you keep your views to yourself and don't express them, that's how I've sort of made [[00:52:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3176.8399999999997s)]
*  my way and made peace there. And I haven't found people necessarily coming to, you know, a few [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3182.52s)]
*  people, a few people will come and pick fights with you. But the trouble comes if you actually [[00:53:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3189.24s)]
*  openly express your views. People don't like it. Like if you want to talk about what you think [[00:53:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3195.0s)]
*  becomes a problem. If you're going to keep your head down and not say what you think, [[00:53:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3201.88s)]
*  like you can get by peaceably. It's so sad. It's really sad. Like I, [[00:53:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3205.56s)]
*  that's how different we are. Like I knew very well how leftist she was. I didn't care. I don't care. [[00:53:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3213.0s)]
*  I just don't care about that in my friendships. Life is too short, you know, but she cared. [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3221.16s)]
*  Like she, once she saw where I stood on COVID, it was a bridge too far. She was, she turned off. [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3227.72s)]
*  She thought I was like somehow gross and afraid and a liar. Like it's okay. Whatever. I mean, [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3233.72s)]
*  enough time spent on her, but yeah, go ahead, Emily. But you were right. This is what drives [[00:54:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3240.52s)]
*  me crazy is like you were right. And she was holding herself up as the, as the sort of fact [[00:54:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3244.8399999999997s)]
*  based arbiter of truth and using her platform to smear you. And it's turned out that you were [[00:54:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3249.9599999999996s)]
*  vindicated. So that's what I think is just like so egregious. So there's no humility looking back [[00:54:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3256.3599999999997s)]
*  and thinking like I was the one who was in the wrong and I was coming out real hot. I was real [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3261.24s)]
*  sanctivodious. I was real close-minded. I was wrong. Megan was right. Shouldn't have smeared her. [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3266.4399999999996s)]
*  There's just none of that. It's just more smears. Yeah. I just don't understand why you wouldn't [[00:54:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3270.68s)]
*  then reach out to me and say, Hey, hope you're okay. I just, I genuinely don't get it as mystery [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3276.68s)]
*  to me. Whatever. Uh, it life's about, you know, the people who are there for you, not the ones [[00:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3283.08s)]
*  who aren't. Um, okay. So let's move on. I think it's fascinating the way that the White House [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3287.96s)]
*  Correspondence Association has canceled this comedian. Now this guy, Eugene Daniels, we've, [[00:54:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3293.64s)]
*  we've shown him to the audience before. He's the one he's openly LGB. I don't know about tea. [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3299.7200000000003s)]
*  I mean, he's posting pictures of himself in like trying to look like Beyonce and sexy Beyonce [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3307.4s)]
*  clothing and wigs. Okay. This is the, this is him. He's the president of the White House Correspondence. [[00:55:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3314.12s)]
*  Okay. Yeah, I don't. Okay. The listening audience, please just go to youtube.com. Okay. [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3320.7599999999998s)]
*  I can't do this justice. Go about an hour into the show and you will see it youtube.com slash [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3328.2799999999997s)]
*  Megan Kelly. And, uh, Eugene thought this woman, Amber Ruffin would be a great hire for the White [[00:55:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3331.88s)]
*  House Correspondence dinner. And now why did he think that she would be a great hire for this [[00:55:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3339.72s)]
*  dinner where the rule here at the gridiron at the Al Smith dinner, all of which are events at which [[00:55:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3345.7999999999997s)]
*  the president will typically appear. I mean, it's a great get the president will come and he'll make [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3352.6s)]
*  fun of himself and he'll take the press's barbs to or those of a comedian. And that, and it's [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3357.8799999999997s)]
*  like a spirit of unity, but the rule was always singe don't burn. That is the rule until Trump. [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3362.44s)]
*  And then these comedians started coming out and lighting bonfires about Sarah's Huckabee Sanders [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3370.28s)]
*  and her devil mascara or whatever the line was. I can't remember it, but it was mean and, um, [[00:56:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3377.88s)]
*  ripping Trump like talk about burning. I mean, it was truly like five alarm fire burning. Okay. We [[00:56:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3384.76s)]
*  have, we have an example of this. Yeah. Here's a montage. Oh, here we go. My team's way ahead of me [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3391.56s)]
*  of some of what we've seen over the years. It's not 11. And I am truly honored to be here. [[00:56:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3396.84s)]
*  Even though all, all of Hollywood pulled out now that King Joffrey is president and it feels like [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3401.56s)]
*  the red wedding in here, we gotta address the elephant. That's not in the room. Trump isn't [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3405.48s)]
*  here. If you haven't noticed, he's not here. And I know, I know I would drag him here myself, [[00:56:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3410.68s)]
*  but it turns out the president of the United States is the one pussy. You're not allowed to grab [[00:56:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3416.92s)]
*  nice. You're all supposed to keep it classy, but anyway, so Amber Ruffin gets hired for the gig [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3424.52s)]
*  and, um, hold on a second. Do we have, we have, okay, we have a little bit of how she sounded [[00:57:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3431.8s)]
*  prior to getting hired. Here's take a listen. [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3440.52s)]
*  In an interview on Monday, president Trump said that the phrase black lives matter is quote bad [[00:57:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3444.6s)]
*  for black people. I fact check that statement and I found out that it is in fact not true. [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3450.44s)]
*  I did some more digging and found out that it was also a dumb thing to think. In addition to that, [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3457.08s)]
*  it's an even dumber thing to say. And those are the facts. [[00:57:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3465.32s)]
*  Oh my God. That is just so typical leftist. It's not funny. It's political. [[00:57:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3472.84s)]
*  It's ripping Trump. She's looking for applause, not laughs. And so Eugene Daniels was like, yeah, [[00:57:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3479.8s)]
*  right on. That's our girl. Let's do this. So she gets hired and the Trump white house [[00:58:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3487.0s)]
*  through a spokesperson, a deputy comms person tweets out. I think, I think comes, [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3494.2799999999997s)]
*  tweets out something like really, really. And she then goes on a media tour promoting her gig [[00:58:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3498.68s)]
*  and the media tour gets her fired here in particular is what appears to have gotten her [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3506.8399999999997s)]
*  fired. Sat seven. Okay. So will anyone from the administration be a tent? How much do you actually [[00:58:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3512.6s)]
*  know about who will be in attendance? Do you get like the rundown? I'm sure that I will at some [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3518.44s)]
*  point. I know the news organizations that will be attending. Like I'm not a hundred percent interested [[00:58:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3525.2400000000002s)]
*  in being like, ha, you're here. Look at your stupid head. You're burned. I care. Like you're kind of a [[00:58:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3531.32s)]
*  bunch of murderers. I mean, so like they were like, you need to be, you know, equal and make sure that [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3537.0s)]
*  the, that you give it to both sides and blah, blah, blah. I was like, there's no way I'm going [[00:59:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3546.68s)]
*  to be freaking doing that dude under no circumstance. Yeah. I think it's just that burns on Trump hurt [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3552.6s)]
*  badly in, and then it trickles down to everyone who is around him. Cause y'all also guilty. So [[00:59:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3559.64s)]
*  I think it just, they got their feelings hurt, but it may want that false equivalency that the media [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3567.32s)]
*  does. They want that. It feels great. It makes them feel like human beings, but they shouldn't [[00:59:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3572.44s)]
*  get to feel that way. Cause they're not. Some people are more culpable than others. That's right. [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3577.0s)]
*  They get more jokes made about them and the jokes are meaner because they're doing things that are [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3583.4s)]
*  worse in a lot of ways. That's how that goes. It can't be even. It actually can't, it can't be [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3589.48s)]
*  even handed and becoming a part of what's wrong. [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3598.84s)]
*  This is who they hire. So that finally got her fired with this sanctimonious statement [[01:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3603.7200000000003s)]
*  by Eugene Daniels, who had earlier said, I mean, this woman's beliefs about Trump and the right [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3608.6000000000004s)]
*  were not a mystery. We could play 10 more soundbites, but when he hired her on February 4th, [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3613.1600000000003s)]
*  he announced he personally chose her, that her talents are unique and the ideal fit for this [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3618.0400000000004s)]
*  current political and cultural climate. Her perspective will fit right in, right in, he said [[01:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3624.6s)]
*  at this dinner. And only when she came out and said the truth about what she's going to do to [[01:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3631.0s)]
*  Samantha Bee on this podcast was he then forced because the White House and the right were [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3636.2s)]
*  completely ripping them to shreds. And I'm sure that there were many right-leaning journalists [[01:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3642.2s)]
*  saying, we're not going, not going to go sit there. And the administration, I mean, [[01:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3646.8399999999997s)]
*  Trump's not going already, but maybe they got an administration of an official or two. I'm sure all [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3650.68s)]
*  of whom said we're out. Then he issues the statement saying the White House Correspondence [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3655.3199999999997s)]
*  Association board has unanimously decided we are no longer featuring a comedic performance this year. [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3661.08s)]
*  I want to ensure the focus is not on the politics of division, but entirely on awarding our [[01:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3668.44s)]
*  colleagues. He says at this consequential moment for journalism, entirely on awarding our colleagues [[01:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3674.84s)]
*  for their outstanding work, their scholarship and mentorship for the next generation of [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3681.0s)]
*  journalists. So what do you make of it, Emily? It's now, there's not going to be a comedian [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3687.32s)]
*  because what we need to do is focus on the outstanding work of the White House press corps. [[01:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3693.56s)]
*  Emily Griswold Oh, yes, it must be celebrated. This is exactly what we were talking about earlier [[01:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3698.28s)]
*  in that anytime they say that there's disproportionate, like, oh, your coverage [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3702.52s)]
*  isn't even it's not balanced between Republicans and Democrats. They say that's because Republicans [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3706.6s)]
*  are worse. This is where they can't even tell what their own biases are. And obviously, this is a comedian [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3710.68s)]
*  who is clearly on the left. She's not claiming to be anything else. But that's the White House [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3716.44s)]
*  Correspondence Association, the bastion of journalistic integrity saying her views are going to fit right [[01:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3721.32s)]
*  in. Of course, like this is exactly what we need. And you know, if they wanted someone who would do [[01:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3727.16s)]
*  a great job skewering Trump and scaring Democrats as well, you could find someone like Thea Vaughn, [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3732.36s)]
*  or you could find someone like even Joe Rogan or Shane Gillis, Andrew Schultz, these guys, [[01:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3738.36s)]
*  it's actually, it's right. And it's actually a really good parallel with what we're talking [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3743.4s)]
*  about with your New York Times interview. It's like they don't understand that some really popular [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3747.4s)]
*  comedians actually go after Republicans to actually go after Trump, like their equal opportunity. [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3751.7200000000003s)]
*  In the same way a lot of podcasters are equal opportunity, they don't hold back when they [[01:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3758.7599999999998s)]
*  disagree with him or when he does something that's, you know, funny and could be spoofed or [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3762.2799999999997s)]
*  satirized. And so they have no idea. They're just in these insane bubbles where they think the only [[01:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3767.72s)]
*  person who can do a good job at the White House Correspondence Association dinner is Amber Ruffin, [[01:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3772.12s)]
*  who is not funny. It's like they hadn't evolved since 2017 with the rest of the country, even [[01:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3777.56s)]
*  though Donald Trump was just elected again with an even higher margin in the Electoral College. [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3783.64s)]
*  So they're completely out of touch. They were caught in it. And the last thing I'll say is [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3788.7599999999998s)]
*  this is always what the White House Correspondence Association dinner should have been. They want to [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3792.68s)]
*  claim it's a fundraiser. They want to claim the moral high ground. We're fundraising for journalism. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3796.7599999999998s)]
*  It's about democracy. Okay, well then stop making it a Hollywood spectacle and just fundraise. Do [[01:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3802.2799999999997s)]
*  that fine, but stop acting like this is some great thing for the country when it's actually just an [[01:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3808.7599999999998s)]
*  orgy of elitism. Yeah. Or you know, it would have been so easy, Eliana, go for Jim Gaffigan, [[01:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3814.04s)]
*  who spoke at the Al Smith dinner. He's a comedian. He's never been really a Trump fan, but he did a [[01:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3820.8399999999997s)]
*  great job that night of ripping on both sides. Remember, this is the one that Kamala didn't show [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3826.52s)]
*  up at. It's this big Catholic adieu in New York City. We were there and Trump clearly finds him [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3831.7999999999997s)]
*  acceptable because Trump showed up. Gaffigan was there. Trump was there. Trump laughed. He was very [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3838.2s)]
*  able to make fun of himself, very open to it. If it's a singe, not burn. It's not that hard. Just [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3844.3599999999997s)]
*  freaking pay up. Go with Gaffigan. Go with somebody you know, Trump, but they don't care. [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3850.04s)]
*  They don't want Trump there. And by the way, Eugene Daniels knew that because he did a joint [[01:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3855.96s)]
*  interview with this Amber Ruffin on Morning Joe when they made the announcement. And the following [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3862.2799999999997s)]
*  exchange happened. Look at SOT9. You say you have invited President Trump and the first lady to [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3867.0s)]
*  attend in his first term. He never did. He didn't. He didn't. He had four shots. Four shots. He missed [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3872.04s)]
*  them all. Do you hope to see him there? No. No, no, she said sitting next to Eugene. He's well aware [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3878.76s)]
*  of Amber's feelings about the Trump administration and Trump himself. That's how she got the invite. [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3887.0s)]
*  So why do you think he pulled it? Like, why didn't he just say, oh, calm down, we're going to stick [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3893.48s)]
*  by her? A couple of reasons. I mean, first of all, the goal should be to have the president there, [[01:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3900.36s)]
*  makes it a more newsworthy event. And one thing we haven't talked about is that there's talk of [[01:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3907.72s)]
*  actually the White House participating in a counter programming event with conservative journalists, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3912.76s)]
*  which would actually take the air out of this event. But Eugene Daniels, who was a co-author [[01:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3919.32s)]
*  of political playbooks, sort of the flagship newsletter of the DC elites, has quit that and [[01:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3924.76s)]
*  left to be a host on the left wing MSNBC, which is spinning off from MSNBC, or from NBC to become its [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3933.48s)]
*  own independent network. And as a result of that, there have been calls for him to resign [[01:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3943.4s)]
*  from the White House correspondence, from the presidency of the White House Correspondence [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3951.2400000000002s)]
*  Association, which is supposed to be held by somebody who's an ostensibly neutral White House [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3956.12s)]
*  reporter. And he's resisted those calls. I think there's also been some unhappiness with the way [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3962.44s)]
*  the White House Correspondence Association has managed this rift with the White House [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3968.52s)]
*  over the White House's takeover of the pool, the White House press pool. This is all very, very [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3973.48s)]
*  Washington inside baseball. But the long and short of it is there's a vibe shift in this town. And [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3979.56s)]
*  this is part of it, which is that it now hurts you to have some lunatic comedian appearing at the [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3985.96s)]
*  White House Correspondence Association dinner, and rather than be honest about that and say, [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3993.32s)]
*  this is not an appropriate entertainer for our dinner, because she said X, Y, and Z, [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=3998.44s)]
*  they're doing a New York Times, and they are lying to their audience about the real reasons [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4004.1200000000003s)]
*  for this shift. And beyond that, you know, the ultimate defense of comedy is being funny. [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4010.44s)]
*  And she did not have that defense. You know, like that's just not that's right. That's not [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4019.8799999999997s)]
*  her goal. Like Stephen Colbert, like Jimmy Kimmel. Well, that was another thing I forgot to mention [[01:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4025.48s)]
*  that Lulu and I had an exchange on my time at NBC and blackface. And there was a point which I said, [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4031.24s)]
*  you know, I would look I was asking the question about when did that go from being something you [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4038.12s)]
*  could do with impunity to something you'd get canceled for. And she was like, everyone knew [[01:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4041.7999999999997s)]
*  it was racist. And I said, Did they really? I like everyone knows now. You know, thanks to [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4047.64s)]
*  what happened to me at NBC. That's also why we have more black santa's everywhere. So you're [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4055.48s)]
*  welcome, everyone. And so I said, everyone knows now. And she was like, and then here's the here, [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4059.64s)]
*  I'll tell you what I said, I actually have here, Sam, I meant to read this earlier. I said, [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4071.16s)]
*  I knew that that had been my experience growing up in the 70s and 80s that people used to do it. I [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4077.72s)]
*  just didn't know that NBC had been airing shows in the past couple of years with people doing it [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4081.8799999999997s)]
*  like scrubs, like Jimmy Kimmel, I meant Fallon. You know, they opened the Oscars with Billy Crystal [[01:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4085.56s)]
*  in blackface. There were so many examples. I said in the interview, but I didn't have it at the [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4091.48s)]
*  ready because I wasn't expecting a huge controversy over it. What'd you say, Steve cracker? [[01:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4097.16s)]
*  And then Jimmy Kimmel, of course, did it too. Jimmy Kimmel did it doing Karl Malone. I mean, [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4102.68s)]
*  he was speaking in ebonics. It was like the most offensive thing you've ever seen in your life. [[01:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4106.44s)]
*  Fine. He's on ABC news every night to now or ABC every night. Then I went on to say, she said, [[01:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4110.28s)]
*  she said, I thought everyone understands that blackface is racist. And I said, now they do. [[01:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4116.679999999999s)]
*  But trust me, some of this made the dance, but not much. I said, Jimmy Kimmel didn't understand [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4121.879999999999s)]
*  it. Jimmy Fallon didn't understand it. NBC didn't understand it. Julianne Hough, who opened the [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4126.2s)]
*  Oscars doing a land acknowledgement the other night, didn't understand it when she was wearing [[01:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4129.5599999999995s)]
*  it. Ted Danson didn't understand it. Whoopi Goldberg didn't understand it. I mean, I could [[01:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4133.0s)]
*  keep going now all day. If you want to, I could give you 12 more names. So it's not true Lulu, [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4136.76s)]
*  that everybody understood that. It is not. So that was my question. When did it go from something [[01:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4142.28s)]
*  that people used to do with impunity? Hello, Justin Trudeau. She included that part to something that [[01:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4147.24s)]
*  will get you canceled. If you go back and look at my comments on the air, that is what I asked. [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4152.04s)]
*  And I went on to say, and for that question, as you point out, ostensibly, they ruined my career. [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4157.56s)]
*  They bazooka'd me. Not they. Andy Lack. He bazooka'd me. By the way, he later lost his job. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4165.72s)]
*  So anywho, this woman, Amber Ruffin, and her history was well known to these people. I have [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4173.72s)]
*  no sympathy for them. I'll just give you one other soundbite, which is why I think Eugene Daniels [[01:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4179.64s)]
*  hired her and loved her so much and thought she was a perfect fit. Here she was in 2021 after [[01:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4184.28s)]
*  the Kyle Rittenhouse verdict on her own show, which was on NBC's Peacock. [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4191.16s)]
*  It's not okay for the judicial system to be blatantly and obviously stacked against people [[01:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4198.92s)]
*  of color. It's not okay for there to be an entirely different set of rules for white people. White [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4205.5599999999995s)]
*  people have been getting away with murder since time began. I don't care about that. I care about [[01:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4213.32s)]
*  you. You matter so much that the second you start to get a sense that you do, a man will grab a gun [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4217.48s)]
*  he shouldn't have in the first place and travel all the way to another state just to quiet you. [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4223.719999999999s)]
*  So yeah, that's why he wanted her. And he learned the hard way. Those days are over. That kind of, [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4231.719999999999s)]
*  you know, just divisive rhetoric is over. The vast majority of the country has rejected it. [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4238.2s)]
*  And we don't think it's funny. We don't think her brand of comedy is funny. So goodbye. Enjoy [[01:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4243.08s)]
*  your ongoing obscurity, Amber. In the world of podcasting and media shows is now Gavin Newsom, [[01:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4248.28s)]
*  the governor of California. There is no bigger fan of Gavin Newsom than Bill Maher. He loves the guy. [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4255.8s)]
*  Bill, snap out of it. And he had Gavin Newsom on his show on Friday night, a couple of soundbites, [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4262.92s)]
*  making the rounds, including this one on the trans issue, SOT19. [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4271.56s)]
*  A lot of people lately talking about this 80-20 issue. And I think you were on the other side of [[01:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4278.360000000001s)]
*  this now, the side with the 80. 80 being 80% of the people in this country. Again, this is the issue [[01:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4283.320000000001s)]
*  of should biologically born men be able to compete in women's sports? That's tough. And, you know, [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4289.400000000001s)]
*  I saw the polling here in California. They think you're a traitor for saying this. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4297.320000000001s)]
*  You know, when those kind of people call you a traitor, there's a word for that, electable. [[01:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4301.4800000000005s)]
*  If the Democrats can't get with 80, how are they going to do something when it's a 51-49? [[01:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4309.64s)]
*  No, look, I get it. And the other side weaponizes these issues. They dehumanize, they attack, [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4315.4800000000005s)]
*  they demean, and they've weaponized this issue extraordinarily well. That said, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4322.2s)]
*  on the fundamental question, is it fair? And I can give you example after example, [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4326.5199999999995s)]
*  just in my home state, there was someone that won a triple jump by eight feet. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4330.76s)]
*  It was fundamentally unfair. We haven't been able to figure that out. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4336.12s)]
*  You see, the right has weaponized. One might even say they pounced, Emily, on this issue. [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4341.5599999999995s)]
*  I mean, yeah, of course, it was the right who was just so excited to talk about bathrooms [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4348.2s)]
*  and locker rooms. They just couldn't resist it, couldn't wait. It wasn't the Obama administration [[01:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4355.8s)]
*  that had a dear colleague letter that wasn't even going through the proper legislative process and [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4360.92s)]
*  suddenly transformed how every school around the country had to use their bathrooms and locker [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4366.12s)]
*  rooms and do sports. No, no, no, it was absolutely the right who just couldn't wait to make an [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4372.04s)]
*  issue out of transgender kids. I mean, this is why Gavin Newsom, I think, is having a hard time [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4377.16s)]
*  on his rehabilitation tour as he's launched his podcast. It's impossible for him to run from his [[01:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4382.599999999999s)]
*  actual record because he can't fully disavow it. He can't fully get away from it. It's like how he [[01:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4391.32s)]
*  said, nobody in our office ever used Latinx. And then a million clips were produced of Gavin [[01:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4397.5599999999995s)]
*  Newsom himself, let alone his office, saying the word Latinx. He can't fully divorce himself from [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4402.68s)]
*  the last 10 years of politics. Oh, we have that. So he tried to tell Charlie Kirk, like nobody in [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4409.08s)]
*  my office has ever used that term Latinx. And then who was it that put this together? [[01:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4413.64s)]
*  It was the K-file, Andrew Kozinski, who is one of the best things about CNN. It's a very short list. [[01:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4421.08s)]
*  You got Harry Enton and you got Andrew. I'm sure there's something more. I like Tapper. He's a [[01:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4426.68s)]
*  friend of mine, but I know our audience is not huge fans. Here's what he found, put together after [[01:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4432.68s)]
*  Newsom was out there claiming, never, never. I hope we can really paint a picture in terms [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4440.76s)]
*  of our consciousness of how impactful this has been on the Latinx community, Latinx community, [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4445.88s)]
*  Latinx and black communities. You've got politicians that are banning not assault [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4452.6s)]
*  rifles, but the word Latinx. They're not even serious. That's so fun. Gavin, Gavin, a simple [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4457.4800000000005s)]
*  Google search about yourself will serve you well before you make these sweeping claims. [[01:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4465.8s)]
*  But on the same dishonest, disingenuous front, he tried to act like he's the reasonable one on the [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4470.84s)]
*  trans and the children issue, Eliana, which is a lie. His state is as radical as they come. Only [[01:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4478.52s)]
*  Minnesota under Tim Walz is more radical, which to his credit, because Bill Maher is on the right [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4487.320000000001s)]
*  side on this issue, meaning correct side. He did raise with Gavin Newsom, who then wiggled and [[01:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4493.240000000001s)]
*  wormed and which was typical in the interview, did not accept any responsibility. Here it is in [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4500.040000000001s)]
*  side 18. But governor, you were the poster boy for a lot of this stuff. California had a rule that [[01:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4505.48s)]
*  schools cannot be required to notify parents if their kids in school have changed their gender, [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4511.719999999999s)]
*  their pronouns. It makes a lot of people go, well, you know what? That's the party without common [[01:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4520.5199999999995s)]
*  sense. Now, if that's your state, how are you? I just disagree with that. I mean, the law was [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4525.48s)]
*  a teacher would be fired if a teacher did not report or snitch on a kid talking about their [[01:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4533.72s)]
*  gender identity. I just think that was wrong. I think teachers should teach. I don't think they [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4539.320000000001s)]
*  should be required to turn in kids. And by the way, turn in, we're talking about their parents. [[01:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4543.400000000001s)]
*  How can you snitch? The idea of a snitch and a parent to me doesn't compare. [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4548.12s)]
*  Well, I just, I don't, but what is the job of a teacher? It's to teach. If Johnny's talking about [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4552.360000000001s)]
*  some identity issue or some issue about liking someone of the same sex, is that the teacher's [[01:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4557.96s)]
*  job to then report that. By the way, in this law, the teacher can still do that, but they can't be [[01:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4562.44s)]
*  fired if that's what, it can't be fired if that's not what they do. And that's something I think is, [[01:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4568.12s)]
*  I just think that was fair. God bless Bill Maher for trying, Eliana. I genuinely appreciate him [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4574.12s)]
*  with the retort of how can you snitch to one's parents when you're talking about a minor and [[01:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4581.96s)]
*  very serious mental problems? I agree with all of that. However, I hate to say, I do think that this [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4588.76s)]
*  podcast thing that Newsom is doing is pretty smart. If he wants to run for president in 2028, [[01:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4599.72s)]
*  it appears he's laser focused on that. And Maher actually introduced him as he's running for [[01:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4606.36s)]
*  president too. Cause he's like, look, you said he's worse except for Tim Walz. Well, he's doing [[01:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4612.36s)]
*  better than like the vast majority than the democratic party, which is switching his position. [[01:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4618.84s)]
*  So he's like, far ahead of all of them. And so the question really is like, are people going to hold [[01:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4624.5199999999995s)]
*  it against him that he's switched all of his positions? I'm not sure if that's really going [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4631.72s)]
*  to matter four years from now, there's going to be lots of embarrassing video. But that's sort of [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4637.64s)]
*  the question that's hanging in my mind is how much will that dog him? But he's doing better than the [[01:17:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4642.280000000001s)]
*  rest of his party mates. I mean, I said this on the Times interview as well. He is smart to start [[01:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4648.6s)]
*  this. And the reason he's smart to start it is because he has no muscles, Emily, none. He's a [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4655.32s)]
*  sinewy little weakling when it comes to arguing any of these issues, especially cultural issues, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4661.88s)]
*  because he, like all liberals has never had to do it. So now he's trying to get his training, [[01:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4667.88s)]
*  which is smart on his part. And it would be smart on the part of conservatives to say no, because [[01:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4673.96s)]
*  they declined to help him get in shape before the big bout. We're supposed to be helping Rocky, [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4679.56s)]
*  not Drago. What happens if this, you know, there's no Republican president and all everything just [[01:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4685.96s)]
*  sort of goes back to the way that it was before Gavin Newsom is not going to be the bulwark for [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4693.400000000001s)]
*  sanity when it comes to kids sports or bathrooms or locker rooms. Look at what happened to the [[01:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4699.160000000001s)]
*  prisons in California. It has just been awful, awful under him. So he is, it is smart, but if he [[01:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4704.04s)]
*  could go a step further and be honest about what he got wrong and why he got it wrong, that would [[01:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4710.36s)]
*  be really impressive. But that's the one thing he will not do. He can't admit. That's why he said [[01:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4715.4s)]
*  Latin X, nobody used it in our office. Like the one thing he can't do is say, here's why I was [[01:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4721.0s)]
*  using the word Latin X. Here's why I thought it was right. Here's why I was supporting these locker [[01:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4725.16s)]
*  room things. Here's why I thought it was right. And here's why I was wrong. He won't do that. So [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4729.72s)]
*  he's not really going to get a lot of the trust back. It's a start. It's not sincere. It's not [[01:18:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4733.88s)]
*  sincere. Like if it were sincere, he would totally own it and say, like, you know, I am genuinely [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4738.6s)]
*  sorry about this. It's Carol Markowitz has a great piece in the New York Post today writing about, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4743.4800000000005s)]
*  it was posted on RealCare politics, talking about how the left seems to be at least grappling with [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4748.04s)]
*  the fact that wokeism was an epic fail and like heartily rejected by the American people, has been [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4755.88s)]
*  and continues to be. But they want to quietly move past it without any acknowledgments of what they [[01:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4762.76s)]
*  did. And same on COVID, same exact thing on COVID. The New York Times, you know, two weeks ago with [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4768.12s)]
*  its piece, like, gee, it really looks like it came from a lab. Why didn't anyone discuss that? [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4774.68s)]
*  Like, you know, conservatives like fire coming out of everybody's ears. What is because you, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4779.0s)]

*  Yeah, we were misled. So it's like, they're trying to do this little sleight of hand, not little, [[01:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4789.160000000001s)]
*  large sleight of hand because they lost that there. They looked at that swing state polling, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9SMOvXiIFKg&t=4797.88s)]
