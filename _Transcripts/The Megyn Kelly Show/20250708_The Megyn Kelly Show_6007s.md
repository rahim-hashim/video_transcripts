*  Remember when CNN tried to take a turn to the more moderate and they were gonna like try to win back [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=24.78s)]
*  Some of their conservative or you know middle-of-the-road viewers that's over this Caitlin Collins [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=29.86s)]
*  This Abby Philip. They're Don Lemon [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=36.78s)]
*  They're just as left [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=40.54s)]
*  It's shocking how far left they've gone. Remember when that Caitlin Collins used to be like I'm from a [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=42.58s)]
*  Southern state and I used to work for Tucker at the Daily Caller so you can trust me [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=48.94s)]
*  She Alabama she's as far left as Don Lemon now you watch her show [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=53.82s)]
*  That's who she is [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=59.34s)]
*  Meantime New York City Democratic mayor [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=61.660000000000004s)]
*  Candidate Zoran Mumdami did not have the most patriotic statement about the 4th of July we did [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=64.10000000000001s)]
*  We're gonna give you some highlights from our big party [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=69.9s)]
*  But wait till you hear how vice president JD Vance responded to Mumdami [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=71.9s)]
*  Which is an interesting thing because clearly the Republican mainstream is [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=76.42s)]
*  Enjoying elevating him. They see him as a Jasmine Crockett. They don't feel afraid of Zoran Mumdami [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=82.74000000000001s)]
*  They love him. They want him to be the face of the Democratic Party and [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=89.38000000000001s)]
*  We should ask our panel today why that is our panel is perfect to answer that question [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=93.42s)]
*  They are the guys from the real clear politics podcast [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=98.5s)]

*  Guys welcome back great to see you [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=198.5s)]
*  Great to be with you. Oh, it's a pleasure. All right [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=201.14s)]
*  So we're not gonna start with mom Dami. We're gonna start with [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=204.54s)]
*  Epstein which I just think is so interesting and I'm I'm noticing something [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  Equally interesting some Trump loyalists some people who are like diet are avoiding the story [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=214.22s)]
*  And I think it's because they don't want to get into sort of civil wars within MAGA, but [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=219.7s)]
*  We don't care we want to talk about what's happening [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=227.34s)]
*  it's a big news story now as a large faction of the right and the MAGA base is [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=230.5s)]
*  turning on part of the Trump administration and [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=236.78s)]
*  I wonder what you guys make of it, you know [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=239.86s)]
*  My own take on it this morning on our am update podcast last night when I joined [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=242.26s)]
*  Afterparty with Emily Jushinsky a new MK media offering that airs live 10 p.m. YouTube calm Mondays and Wednesdays [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=246.94s)]
*  was [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=254.22s)]
*  That this I put it mostly on Pam Bondi [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=255.46s)]
*  And the reason I do that is because I know cash and damn [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=258.78000000000003s)]
*  Bongino said a lot of stuff about Epstein when they were private citizens [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=261.94s)]
*  But ever since they got into the FBI have not heard them torque up the conspiracy [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=265.42s)]
*  I don't want to say theories, but just like thoughts and [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=271.26s)]
*  ideas around Epstein their [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=275.74s)]
*  Statements as public officials [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=279.38s)]
*  Have so far been consistent with the statement they made last night were on Sunday night to Axios in this statement that they were [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=281.3s)]
*  released but Pam Bondi [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=287.26s)]
*  has been like [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=289.42s)]
*  putting oil on this fire since she became the [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=291.5s)]
*  Head of the Department of Justice the Attorney General and I have to say it's very unusual [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=296.3s)]
*  For the head of the DOJ to be speaking the way she has been [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=301.42s)]
*  Usually the the Attorney General tries not to make a lot of comments about the cases [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=305.70000000000005s)]
*  They're investigating or have under their purviews been weird to hear her [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=310.46000000000004s)]
*  So vocal about it which led a lot of people to think man [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=313.74s)]
*  They must really be on to something and finally we're gonna get real answers on this case [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=317.5s)]
*  And then the Sunday night news drop comes to Axios not exactly right-wing friendly saying there's nothing [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=321.14000000000004s)]
*  There'll be no more release of any documents. There's no there there. He killed himself. There's no client list [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=327.54s)]
*  There are no powerful people he was blackmailing and you're not getting another single document. So your take on it [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=333.98s)]
*  Let me start with you on a Tom [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=340.90000000000003s)]
*  Well, I agree with you [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=343.42s)]
*  I mean so Pam Bondi made this statement that she said it's sitting on my desk and you know [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=344.42s)]
*  Peter Ducey asked about that at the briefing and [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=348.98s)]
*  Caroline Levitt tried to parse that and say well she was talking about the review not the list itself [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=351.74s)]
*  And so that explains this discrepancy that people are you know, she just mentioned the list play that time [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=356.18s)]
*  Forgive the interruption, but I'll play this on back and you pick it up on the back end. Yeah, according to the report this [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=362.18s)]
*  systematic review revealed no [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=368.22s)]
*  incriminating client list [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=370.58s)]
*  So what happened to the Epstein client list that the Attorney General said she had on her desk? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=372.78000000000003s)]
*  Well, I think if you go back and look at what the Attorney General said in that interview [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=378.46000000000004s)]
*  Which was on your network on Fox News [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=382.66s)]
*  Go on Robert said DOJ may be releasing the list of Jeffrey Epstein's clients [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=384.66s)]
*  Will that really happen and she said it's sitting on my desk right now to review [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=389.24s)]
*  Yes, she was saying the entirety of all of the paperwork all of the paper in relation to Jeffrey Epstein's crimes [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=393.96s)]
*  That's what the Attorney General was referring to and I'll let her speak for that [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=400.84s)]
*  But again when it comes to the FBI and the Department of Justice [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=404.28s)]
*  They are more than committed to ensuring that bad people are put behind bars this Attorney General and the FBI director are [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=407.53999999999996s)]
*  Committed to putting bad people behind bars where they belong that they promised an exhaustive review [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=414.14s)]
*  That's what they did for any further details. I would refer you to the Department of Justice [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=419.74s)]
*  Very rare you see Caroline Levitt on her heels or so obviously spinning that was one instance. Go ahead Tom [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=425.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, so I mean the thing about that is is if that's what she meant [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=433.14s)]
*  That's certainly not how it was portrayed in the meeting when she said it months ago [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=436.7s)]
*  So she could have clarified it at any time said no no no no no I didn't say there was a list [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=441.02000000000004s)]
*  I just meant the review she also said there were tens of thousands of videos and and so, you know that kind of [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=444.82000000000005s)]
*  She could have if she wanted to clarify her statement [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=451.86s)]
*  She could have and she didn't and the other thing, you know people have been talking about it [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=454.54s)]
*  I've been following this obviously online is that you know, so galane Maxwell is in prison for [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=457.74s)]
*  trafficking kids to whom [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=464.42s)]
*  Somebody right we know that there are people involved and so look [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=467.42s)]
*  I think this is a mess for the administration and and they have been it is one of those things that [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=472.66s)]
*  It's been a super, you know, highly public interest story people have wanted to know what's going on [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=478.74s)]
*  And and it felt like the government has been withholding information from them [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=484.82s)]
*  We ran a piece on on real clear politics this morning from Mike Schellenberger [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=488.86s)]
*  Who's no, you know right-wing nut and and saying look the public sort of [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=493.3s)]
*  Congress should demand and the Trump administration should provide transparency on this issue because right now they've just kind of made a mess of it [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=498.06s)]
*  Yeah, what do you think Carl? [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=505.34000000000003s)]
*  Well client list was an unfortunate phrase to be used to begin with. I mean Jeffrey Epstein wasn't [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=507.62s)]
*  Convicted of being a pimp I guess [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=515.14s)]
*  I guess your son [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=517.82s)]
*  Yeah, his girlfriend was yeah, he was a creeper just to be clear just because galane Maxwell was found guilty of sex trafficking girls [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=519.66s)]
*  to Epstein like [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=527.38s)]
*  Finding young girls for Epstein's sexual pleasure ahead Carl [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=529.38s)]
*  But not not for you know, Bill Clinton or Alan Dershowitz or Donald Trump or these names that people floated for Jeffrey Epstein [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=533.06s)]
*  Who killed himself in prison? That's the the charge, you know, it's a scandal that the most visible [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=539.8199999999999s)]
*  Defendants in federal custody kill themselves or are killed it happened to whitey bulger [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=546.9s)]
*  The prison system is the Federal Bureau of prisons should really be asked to account for itself [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=552.8199999999999s)]
*  Why why these people are killed why these things happen that the information should be made public? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=557.86s)]
*  But if you're if you're not if you're not in the fever swamps of conspiracies you think well [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=562.66s)]
*  Here's a narcissistic guy who finally got caught and finally got caught in a justice system. He couldn't escape [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=567.18s)]
*  He was looking at life in prison if he committed suicide, that's not that's not unheard of that [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=573.42s)]
*  It happens doesn't doesn't like does it make sense? [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=578.98s)]
*  And then but the the people loyal to Trump's, you know [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=582.38s)]
*  It kept spinning this these conspirator before he even committed suicide because they they thought they they could get Bill Clinton or somebody like that [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=586.34s)]
*  Then of course, you know Donald Trump knew Jeffrey Epstein [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=595.18s)]
*  The from what I've read and everything and I looked into this at the time a couple years ago when Trump realized what? [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=600.26s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein was about he recoiled from that he and he said, you know, he likes him very young and he distanced himself from [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=607.5799999999999s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein so so there there's no reason we don't have any evidence that these famous people [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=615.9799999999999s)]
*  I don't want to talk about the prince. Well, we know they were on the mayor [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=622.9799999999999s)]
*  They were on the plane and that many of them visited Epstein Island and visited his Manhattan mansion [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=626.54s)]
*  But Epstein had a very very wide web of connections. He was he was friends with the president of MIT [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=632.42s)]
*  He was regularly appearing at Harvard. He was hanging out with royalty like Prince Andrew, but others as well [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=638.66s)]
*  So it was very easy for Epstein to get people on his jet and visiting him in his island [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=644.7199999999999s)]
*  It doesn't mean all of them were there to take advantage of barely legal type young girls [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=650.42s)]
*  But but the thing look we've had a couple of things [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=657.14s)]
*  We've had girls who were in that mansion say there were cameras everywhere and they knew that they were being filmed like Virginia Juffre [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=660.5799999999999s)]
*  She's probably the most notable she recently died. But do you Virginia Juffre lied many times about the Epstein case? [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=666.5799999999999s)]
*  I thought I followed it very closely many many many times. So we don't know what's true [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=674.14s)]
*  Apparently there are videotapes of [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=679.54s)]
*  Epstein is how the DOJ is making it sound now with these barely legal type girls [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=681.54s)]
*  And in addition we believe and I'm gleaning from what they put out in that statement [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=686.26s)]
*  child sexual assault materials that appear to have been looked at on his computer like [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=691.02s)]
*  Forgive me. He was it we used to call it kiddie porn [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=697.3399999999999s)]
*  But you know child pornography that it appears he might have been looking at and if you read deep on this case [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=699.4s)]
*  What you find is that if there was some case in which a civil plaintiff? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=705.7s)]
*  Demanded documents and certain files and it appears that the DOJ may have found that stuff on an Epstein computer at one point [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=710.0200000000001s)]
*  And had to produce it or at least notify the other side [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=717.58s)]
*  They produced it but there was a lockdown on any of that because you're not allowed to share those types of files for the protection [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=721.26s)]
*  of the children [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=727.46s)]
*  but that forgive me, it seems like a non sequitur like [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=728.98s)]
*  His obsession with [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=733.34s)]
*  Pornography or what he was looking at that he got off the internet is not really what the issue is it's disgusting and felonious [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=735.4200000000001s)]
*  But Andrew it the the issue is whether there are powerful men who were using [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=741.98s)]
*  Epstein and galane Maxwell to funnel young girls or underage girls to them [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=747.82s)]
*  That there's a list of that are now being protected by government because they're so powerful or they're so wealthy [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=752.5s)]
*  That both sides of the aisle will just bend the knee to make sure they don't get brought down [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=759.0600000000001s)]
*  That's why people are interested in these so-called files or lists [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=764.22s)]
*  Yeah, no, and I I think that you laid it out perfectly and I think I [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=767.98s)]
*  Hate when people just call this conspiracy theory because I think this is a very legitimate news story that deserves to be looked into [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=773.1s)]
*  By the mainstream press, you know, the vice president himself said that before he before the election [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=780.02s)]
*  That this is a really important story and people should he said they should release the list [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=786.04s)]
*  Exactly use the word list. Yeah, so I I you know, I hope people keep digging into it [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=790.52s)]
*  There's a little wrinkle here that that I'm interested in [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=796.8s)]
*  I don't know but there is this minute that is missing from the from the tape that they released of his cell [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=799.88s)]
*  The minute before midnight. I mean, I will say if you're conspiracy theorists the minute before midnight is kind of too perfect [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=806.52s)]
*  Movie title. Yeah, but it no, I think it I think it's a it's a real question and I think that there is [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=813.52s)]
*  at least a [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=820.9200000000001s)]
*  Plausible case to be made that this is a cover-up and as such it should be investigated. So [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=822.9200000000001s)]
*  again, you know [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=830.36s)]
*  Whether Trump is involved or not according to Elon Musk. He is I don't know but I think you have to [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=832.64s)]
*  That for a second would have released it Biden right? Yep, and Andrew [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=839.84s)]
*  I mean Merrick Garland would have released that in right in the course of the election if he were if maybe his name was [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=844.6s)]
*  In the book, but that doesn't mean anything, you know, I mean [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=851.88s)]
*  Alan Dershowitz his name was in the book because he was his lawyer. That doesn't mean Alan Dershowitz was a client [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=855.2800000000001s)]
*  I'm well aware of the accusations against him by Virginia Dufresne, which were utter bullshit utter bullshit [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=859.64s)]
*  He was not yeah she he proved that they were wrong he was not in the yes country [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=866.0s)]
*  He was out of he was overseas when she said he was you know in this island and she wound up confessing [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=870.76s)]
*  Oh, I may have been confused about him [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=876.28s)]
*  But you know you mentioned the autopsy which is sort of or like the the the death was it a suicide or was it a murder? [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=878.16s)]
*  it's connected to the question of client list and whether he was being blackmailed because [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=884.8399999999999s)]
*  People believe he was killed because they think there were these powerful forces out there that had a reason to kill him [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=888.5999999999999s)]
*  So those two do go hand in hand and it's not just crazy right-wing [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=895.04s)]
*  conspirators as Kaylin Collins was saying on her show last night [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=900.88s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein's brother Mark hired dr. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=905.16s)]
*  Baden who is world renowned for his skills as a forensic pathologist [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=908.5999999999999s)]
*  Who conducted an autopsy on Jeffrey Epstein and came out of the autopsy saying? [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=914.16s)]
*  This was a murder he has a bone that was fractured in the front of his throat that gets [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=920.64s)]
*  Basically it gets broken typically when you've been strangled not I guess when you hang yourself [[00:15:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=928.04s)]
*  And there were other indications by dr. Baden that led him to say this was [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=933.4s)]
*  Not a suicide this doesn't look like a suicide so and there were other [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=938.6800000000001s)]
*  questions too that that Jeffrey Epstein's brother has been raising so it's like [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=943.6800000000001s)]
*  It's more than just right-wing nuts as like some in the press would have you believe Tom who are saying wait [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=949.04s)]
*  And and on top of all that you've got the bondi statements over and over the one saying [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=955.92s)]
*  She didn't say the files on my desk. She she was asked specifically about the client list and she said it's on [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=961.88s)]
*  My desk right now then a week later. She promised Jesse waters [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=969.28s)]
*  She was about to dump some sort of information dump that we were all gonna be really interested in the next day was the influencer [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=973.6s)]
*  debacle at the White House where for some reason [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=980.6s)]
*  She invited invited some of the president's most loyal supporters and tried to humiliate them by giving them Epstein file-marked [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=983.5600000000001s)]
*  Binders which had nothing new in them it was all publicly released information that had already been out there [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=991.36s)]
*  Then she acted indignant and she didn't know is that the sleazy FBI who had withheld the real [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=997.12s)]
*  Documents from her she was gonna get to the bottom of it [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1003.28s)]
*  Then not know she said further release would come one did not come [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1005.88s)]
*  then she was caught on tape saying there are tens of thousands of [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1010.9599999999999s)]
*  Kitty porn or child pornography material that we found which again is like a third issue over here and [[00:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1014.1999999999999s)]
*  Next thing we know there's no there there and by the way on top of all that that same week between Feb [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1021.56s)]
*  21 and Feb 26 is 26 when Pam body made those two statements [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1026.68s)]
*  Client list is on my desk and more information is gonna drop tomorrow [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1030.74s)]
*  You had Alina Habba who was then working for the president. She's officially counselor to the president [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1033.9399999999998s)]
*  She had been his private attorney in that New York ridiculous case against his business [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1039.4199999999998s)]
*  And she would go to work for Pam Bondi three weeks later saying this to Piers Morgan [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1043.58s)]
*  But in this case in Epstein's case, it is incredibly disturbing. We have flight logs. We have information names [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1049.06s)]
*  That will come out. Is it gonna be shocking? [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1056.58s)]
*  names I [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1060.04s)]
*  Don't see how it's not shocking that there were so many individuals that were hidden [[00:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1062.52s)]
*  and [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1070.12s)]
*  Kept secret and not been held accountable. Let's talk about the reverse. I believe in accountability [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1071.36s)]
*  So you have to now go through your process now. I won't say they're guilty until they go through their time in court [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1077.54s)]
*  But again now it's time for accountability [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1084.12s)]
*  We have seen for so many years Pierce in this country many [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1086.76s)]
*  Investigations subpoenas testimonies in Congress, etc, etc, but there's a general frustration with accountability [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1090.1200000000001s)]
*  We take it halfway. We don't take it home. And I really believe that now with cash and Pam there will be accountability [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1096.4s)]
*  Okay, Tom, what's she talking about names [[00:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1103.96s)]
*  Accountability they're gonna have their day in court. I don't want to declare them guilty before they have their day. That's pretty specific [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1107.96s)]
*  Yeah, and to turn around just say oh, there's a list that look this is not good [[00:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1113.32s)]
*  They want this story to end it's not gonna end [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1117.32s)]
*  In fact, it's probably gonna make it worse because it has just raised a whole new set of questions about okay [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1120.1599999999999s)]
*  Now now the Trump administration who promised us [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1125.1599999999999s)]
*  Accountability and transparency on all sorts of issues is now doing the exact same thing that previous administrations have done and you can already see that bubbling up [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1128.3999999999999s)]
*  online among Trump supporters who are just you know disappointed [[00:18:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1137.28s)]
*  At the way that they've handled this and to your point Megan, I mean up until 24 hours ago [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1141.64s)]
*  You know, they had given a whole host of indications and statements pointing in the direction of there being a list there being names [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1147.56s)]
*  There being people that were going to face consequences and now suddenly it's just like they wave a magic wand and it's like [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1154.16s)]
*  Oh, well, you know, there's nothing there and we're moving on. I don't think it's gonna happen [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1159.64s)]
*  What's interesting though? As I say, I've been listening carefully to bond. Geno to cash [[00:19:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1163.64s)]
*  Since taking office they have not said the bondi stuff. They are not out on that same limb [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1168.8799999999999s)]
*  Since taking over at FBI only she is and one of the reasons that's interesting [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1174.12s)]
*  Carl is because Trump sent out a tweet last night praising [[00:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1178.6s)]
*  Two of the three that we're talking about here cash Patel and damn bond [[00:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1183.0s)]
*  You know noticeably absent from the list was Pam Bondi and I'm he knows as well as you and I know she's under fire [[00:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1187.92s)]
*  Go ahead Carl [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1195.44s)]
*  Well, I was gonna ask you follow this story more closely than we have and I was gonna ask you what what do you think? [[00:19:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1196.48s)]
*  Is you have cash Patel especially and Pam Bondi the Attorney General? [[00:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1203.48s)]
*  And the FBI director both appointed by Trump both Trump loyalists both praise Trump all the time [[00:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1208.04s)]
*  But they're telling different stories. Who do you think is right? Who do you think is telling the truth? [[00:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1213.8s)]
*  Well, look, I my audience knows I am not very conspiratorial [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1218.76s)]
*  At all like I disbelieve almost every one of them. I have no doubts that we did land on the moon [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1224.12s)]
*  I you know, I'm just not one of those people at all [[00:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1229.8799999999999s)]
*  9-eleven actually happened [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1233.9599999999998s)]
*  9-eleven happened. We didn't detonate a building like I don't believe in any of that. I don't none of it [[00:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1235.9599999999998s)]
*  No, I believe COVID started in a lab. I'm not that crazy, you know [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1241.7199999999998s)]
*  They got a mic you're completely taking all the government nonsense [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1244.6s)]
*  But I I'm one of those people who nine times that it sends. I believe it's government and government [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1247.9599999999998s)]
*  As opposed to big like government machinations against us [[00:20:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1252.28s)]
*  but in and in this case [[00:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1256.12s)]
*  I don't know what's happening. Bondi has confused me. I don't know what she's doing [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1259.6399999999999s)]
*  However, I have not really believed that there's a massive conspiracy around Epstein because [[00:21:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1265.3999999999999s)]
*  The I know somebody very close to the case and this person knows everything there is to know about the case [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1271.32s)]
*  And this person all along has been telling me that it really was Epstein's case [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1276.6s)]
*  That it really was Epstein was into the barely legal types like legal but barely legal [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1280.8400000000001s)]
*  That Epstein wasn't having young children [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1286.76s)]
*  You know come to any of his places and wasn't actually having interactions with any anyone who would be blatantly illegal [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1290.92s)]
*  And that this person said galane maxwell really wasn't a pimp for other [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1299.96s)]
*  You know farming out young girls to other men now [[00:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1305.56s)]
*  I didn't know whether it was true or not, but I have all these years [[00:21:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1308.6s)]
*  I have yet to see something that disproves any of that and on top of that the doj [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1311.32s)]
*  Brought a case they they brought a case against Epstein [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1316.68s)]
*  They brought a case against galane maxwell like the doj were engaged in a massive cover-up. Why would they bring these cases? [[00:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1319.32s)]
*  You know, why would they? [[00:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1325.56s)]
*  Open up these federal investigations against them and go into federal court or be prepared to an Epstein's case before he died [[00:22:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1327.08s)]
*  Um, it just doesn't seem that's not exactly how you should orchestrate or would orchestrate a cover-up [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1333.72s)]
*  And I also have maybe i'm the only one but I I trust bill bar [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1339.6399999999999s)]
*  And he took a deep dive on this and swore to me that Epstein killed himself [[00:22:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1343.56s)]
*  I believe damn bungeeno when he's on fox saying there's nothing we've looked at the tape [[00:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1349.1599999999999s)]
*  I know maybe there's a missing I don't know how he's going to explain that but I believe him [[00:22:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1353.56s)]
*  And I think he's told me in many settings [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1357.32s)]
*  There's nothing there's nothing to support that he was murdered [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1360.76s)]
*  And I believe him. So anyway, that's where I am [[00:22:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1363.8s)]
*  I but I understand why other people disagree with me based on all the discussions we're having [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1365.8799999999999s)]
*  Can I add one thing to what you said megan? Could the answer simply be that pam bondy is over her head? [[00:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1370.44s)]
*  I mean she she came to office with a really good resume attorney general florida, you know [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1375.8s)]
*  Prosecutors that they've you know in the federal system who they've now said are deep state, you know saboteurs [[00:23:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1381.78s)]
*  Told me that they had high hopes for her that you know [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1388.44s)]
*  She had she was more qualified than some of these other people like, you know [[00:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1391.48s)]
*  Tulsi gabbert and bobby kennedy jr for the job that she got but she's done this [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1395.48s)]
*  She's spoken out of school the way I've never heard an ag speak on other cases, you know [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1400.5200000000002s)]
*  There was this case. We're gonna we're gonna throw the book at that person. We're not gonna plea bargain it [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1405.16s)]
*  We're gonna you know [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1409.4s)]
*  Give them 30 years before the before the indictment and she just has behaved in ways [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1410.1200000000001s)]
*  On other cases that makes me wonder if she's the sat question that doesn't add up here [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1416.0400000000002s)]
*  I mean just look at the influencer thing you guys [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1423.5600000000002s)]
*  What what kind of an attorney general just take it take a step back what kind of an attorney general [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1428.5200000000002s)]
*  Would pretend [[00:23:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1434.68s)]
*  She's giving new information to some of the president's most loyal [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1436.3600000000001s)]
*  Advocates in the press, you know buying ink by the barrel [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1441.6399999999999s)]
*  What so either pam bonnie knew she was about to embarrass? [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1445.9599999999998s)]
*  Some of his most loyal surrogates out there and did that willingly or she didn't [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1450.6s)]
*  Take the time to make sure [[00:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1456.76s)]
*  What was in those binders? She was too lazy to actually figure out none of this is new [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1459.8799999999999s)]
*  And and yet she called a meeting [[00:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1466.8400000000001s)]
*  With the influencers that included cash patel the head of the FBI and the sitting vice president [[00:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1469.5600000000002s)]
*  So she's either lazy and incompetent [[00:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1475.0s)]
*  Or she willingly [[00:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1478.1200000000001s)]
*  Humiliated some of the president's most loyal supporters [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1480.18s)]
*  Neither one of those is good and that's why i'm sorry [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1483.16s)]
*  But i'm going to predict her days are numbered as a member of the trump administration. Am I right or wrong? [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1485.4s)]
*  What do you guys think and or you got the high eyebrows? [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1490.0400000000002s)]
*  Uh, well, you know the half-life of a trump appointee is is always difficult to uh, [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1493.16s)]
*  predict [[00:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1500.68s)]
*  So I don't I don't think i'd predict one way or the other on that. Um, I think overall [[00:25:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1502.04s)]
*  Uh, I think he likes her. I think she's um in you know, despite this latest, uh hiccup [[00:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1506.8400000000001s)]
*  I think that he he thinks that she represents him well and um, I I think she sticks around but I don't know it's [[00:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1512.52s)]
*  You know depends on i'm not so sure if you look at conservative twitter [[00:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1520.1200000000001s)]
*  She's right right in the crosshairs. I mean [[00:25:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1524.84s)]
*  A lot of people are angry with her and not just because of that influencer stunt but because I think that's true, but on camera [[00:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1528.3600000000001s)]
*  Yeah, but i'm not sure that trump, uh [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1534.6s)]
*  Cares that much about influential about twitter or anything else anymore. Tom bevin does I think I think [[00:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1537.56s)]
*  Trump thinks that he just got fired [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1543.8s)]
*  He's declared what what america first means and you know, he's the you know, you may be right things [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1546.12s)]
*  I will say this just for not for nothing, but I think her stock has gone way down [[00:25:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1551.72s)]
*  And you know what? Can I tell you I think christy gnome stock has gone up christy gnome [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1556.12s)]
*  Dialed back the over-the-top hair and makeup and photo opportunities situation that was going on [[00:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1560.84s)]
*  Credit for that. I know she was listening to your show. I I accept [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1567.72s)]
*  I accept [[00:26:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1571.56s)]
*  um [[00:26:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1572.84s)]
*  But I think she's done a much better job. She's been totally [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1573.96s)]
*  Appropriate on this texas flooding situation. She's striking exactly the right tone [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1577.94s)]
*  She's got like very nice empathy, you know, she's a mom. She's a grandmom [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1583.48s)]
*  She's coming into it in a in a very good way [[00:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1587.72s)]
*  And I think a lot of those photo ops [[00:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1590.6000000000001s)]
*  President trump wanted her to do he wanted her to be doing them [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1593.0s)]
*  It was the glam that was over the top, but she's dialed it back [[00:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1596.44s)]
*  I think her stock is rising and I think pam bondis is definitely on the wane. Go ahead tom [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1599.08s)]
*  I I think I agree with you on that and you know with regard to to ice [[00:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1604.92s)]
*  Uh, you know tom homans the one who's been doing he's been everywhere and and he's been taking all comers in terms of media interviews [[00:26:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1610.52s)]
*  And he sort of became the face of of ice and she kind of receded. I think and started doing a little bit less [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1617.48s)]
*  Um, but I agree with you about pam bondi. I mean the the influencer thing is really interesting [[00:27:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1623.72s)]
*  Because but again that that happened so long ago. I mean if she [[00:27:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1629.0s)]
*  You know [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1633.48s)]
*  If her stock went down after that [[00:27:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1634.6s)]
*  No, it wasn't that it that's where it started [[00:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1637.16s)]
*  But it's been a steady drumbeat now, you know [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1639.8799999999999s)]
*  And now the culmination of like I I think the administration very much wants to move on from that news drop to axios on sunday night [[00:27:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1642.04s)]
*  But but the fact that you I don't think I don't see that happening [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1649.8s)]
*  But to your point what's interesting about this is she called this big meeting it was at the white house [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1654.12s)]
*  This big production this big show and you know, the influencers come out and I remember I was following it online at the time [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1658.4399999999998s)]
*  Everybody was because we were like, oh my gosh, we're gonna get all these details and then they they're like, well, uh, okay [[00:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1664.28s)]
*  this is you know, we already know this we already they were sort of going through it in real time and [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1669.6399999999999s)]
*  And they were all kind of disappointed. And so [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1674.4399999999998s)]
*  It was this huge production [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1677.3999999999999s)]
*  that [[00:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1680.4399999999998s)]
*  She she orchestrated but but also the the white house did I mean they played along with it [[00:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1681.8799999999999s)]
*  I mean they hosted the meeting and but then privately remember tom they started distancing themselves from her after that [[00:28:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1685.88s)]
*  You heard these reports in a couple of media outlets that the white house staff was like, oh my god. What is she doing? [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1690.6000000000001s)]
*  We didn't sanction this we didn't think it was okay to bring in the vice president and others like what this is all a [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1695.96s)]
*  Pambandi operation [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1700.7600000000002s)]
*  Right. Well, somebody's got to take the fall for it. It was a debacle for sure if they let her go though [[00:28:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1703.24s)]
*  If they push her out doesn't that encourage the conspiracy theorists? Don't they just ah see she's the only one well [[00:28:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1707.96s)]
*  They won't cite this it'll you know, they'll cite something else. They'll wait until something else happens, you know trump [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1713.72s)]
*  He's not dumb, but I just don't think I don't think trump created this. I I [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1719.4s)]
*  My money if I had to put my own personal money on it. My money would be [[00:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1724.04s)]
*  They genuinely didn't find any evidence of murder [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1727.88s)]
*  They genuinely didn't find the so-called big list and that pambandi in an effort to like get on tv [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1731.4s)]
*  And get people excited got over her skis on her messaging if I had to bet that's what i'd bet [[00:28:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1739.8000000000002s)]
*  And for that she should be punished [[00:29:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1746.2s)]
*  Because the people who got hurt and embarrassed and lost credibility as a result of all that are the president's media supporters [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1748.3600000000001s)]
*  like that's not a good group to embarrass and that that's a group to which [[00:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1756.92s)]
*  Trump should be loyal. You know that they didn't deserve that she did it and the only way for her to fix it [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1762.28s)]
*  Was for there to be a real drop of actual info on epstein that she then leaked to them [[00:29:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1768.84s)]
*  To make up for what she had done and what we're seeing now as a result of the sunday night drop to axios [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1775.48s)]
*  Is there isn't one she doesn't have it [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1782.6s)]
*  Many people believe she does have it now. She's just been brow beaten into not releasing it either way. It's a fail on her part. So [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1786.6s)]
*  Her stock's down. It would not be buying bondi bonds today [[00:29:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1793.8799999999999s)]
*  Um, okay, let's keep going out in california [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1797.96s)]
*  We have got ice and tom homan's team [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1803.24s)]

*  Your lovely mayor karen bass [[00:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1813.0s)]
*  Goes out there not to say thank you. It's riddled with ms 13 [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1815.8000000000002s)]
*  Literally no children ever play here because they could get shot [[00:30:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1819.88s)]
*  It's become a place where illegal immigrants go to get false ids and try not to get killed by ms 13 [[00:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1823.08s)]
*  She calls up the head of cpb out there and says get out [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1829.32s)]
*  Don't come here. We don't want you in response to which that guy says [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1833.64s)]
*  I don't work for you and i'm sorry, but you're going to be very disappointed because [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1838.92s)]

*  Rid of the scourge that is known as ms 13 and on whose side are you mr. Cannon? [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1849.88s)]
*  Well, I want to clarify i'm from san francisco. So the the mayor [[00:30:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1856.36s)]
*  gavin newson was my mayor and we can get to it later, but um [[00:31:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1860.76s)]
*  Karen bass was you know, she's in this spirited competition with brandon johnson who who can be the most ineffective mayor [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1866.04s)]
*  It's it's impressive really [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1873.64s)]
*  Yeah in its way dark horse coming up the the third position in the lane possible [[00:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1876.0400000000002s)]
*  The big apple [[00:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1883.3200000000002s)]
*  You know, she she was a member of the house for a long time and kind of [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1885.48s)]
*  Generally well liked pleasant person not considered a heavyweight [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1889.64s)]
*  And when she ran for mayor, I I remember being surprised she had no executive authority. I didn't think she'd win. She did win [[00:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1895.16s)]
*  Um, she when we've been talking this week about you know, national weather service alerts when [[00:31:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1901.56s)]
*  When the alert came that los angeles was a combustible, you know a combustible [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1907.72s)]
*  Um, she went to africa on a junket to an inauguration. I think it was the president of gana. I don't know why [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1912.84s)]
*  And when she got back, you know in the piss the palisades were burning her response was to fire the fire chief [[00:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1919.4s)]
*  so, you know, she has [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1926.04s)]
*  Distinguished herself by being [[00:32:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1928.82s)]
*  You know feckless and ineffective and I don't know why I it's a bit of a mystery to me. She had long experience in politics [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1932.04s)]
*  Rarely made a mistake. She was very very she was very left. Um, but this um [[00:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1939.8799999999999s)]
*  These missteps I guess right now to end a democratic politics. Uh, if you're from a big city megan [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1945.8799999999999s)]
*  We talked about this on our show. You've got to you know, you you got to position yourself against [[00:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1952.76s)]
*  Against ice against the immigration service. You've got to favor open borders sanctuary cities all these things [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1957.72s)]
*  But you're really saying that you don't want the law to be followed [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1963.8s)]
*  And I think it's it's it seems to me a dead end for the democrats and I don't know why they keep [[00:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1966.9199999999998s)]
*  You know, it's like keep going down that [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1972.28s)]
*  that cul-de-sac [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1975.24s)]
*  This two points when we were in new york and our kids were going to these new york city private schools [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1976.84s)]
*  um as expensive as they were as fancy as they were they supposedly were the [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1981.72s)]
*  The playground right next to our all-boys school [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1987.0s)]
*  Was referred to by the boys as dog poop playground. It's just riddled with dog poop [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1990.36s)]
*  People not picking up after their dogs to me. This is like taking the side of the dog poop [[00:33:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=1996.36s)]
*  This isn't like immigrants enjoy this park. It's ms 13 [[00:33:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2001.72s)]
*  They literally are killing your citizens and getting people addicted to drugs like innocent americans [[00:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2005.96s)]
*  And you're on the side of the dog poop like somebody came through and said i'm going to clean up all the dog poop [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2011.48s)]
*  So the children can play and they don't have to deal with it anymore and the mayor came out and said [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2016.04s)]
*  The dog poop stays step away. This is this is the position she's taking and it's not just her you're right [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2020.6s)]
*  Zora mumdami who is likely to be our next mayor in new york city [[00:33:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2026.2s)]
*  Is having this clash right now with the sitting mayor eric adams where mumdami is saying I will not work with ice [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2029.3999999999999s)]
*  I will not funnel any illegals to ice's way [[00:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2035.96s)]
*  Even if there's a federal detainer on them so that they can be deported and eric adams is out there eric [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2039.8s)]
*  Adams i'm for the corrupt one. I really hope eric adams wins reelection. I don't care if he's corrupt [[00:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2045.8s)]
*  It's like so he took a couple gold bars from egypt or something like that [[00:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2051.08s)]
*  This is the least of our problems [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2055.2400000000002s)]
*  And like you got the sex pest you got the corrupt guy and you got the communist you guys work with me [[00:34:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2058.76s)]
*  So mumdami is saying no ice and eric adams [[00:34:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2064.92s)]
*  Was on camera saying you know what? [[00:34:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2069.16s)]
*  You got to work with these federal agencies [[00:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2071.56s)]
*  This is the same as saying like we're not going to pay our taxes. We're not going to deal with the iron like [[00:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2073.64s)]
*  We have to we have no choice, but this nutcase caroine bass [[00:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2077.72s)]
*  She okay. This is um [[00:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2081.72s)]
*  She goes out there after 45 minutes after they got there [[00:34:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2083.72s)]
*  She showed up and she called up the border patrol chief the chief the guy I mentioned his name is gregory bovino [[00:34:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2086.2s)]
*  And told him they needed to leave [[00:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2091.8799999999997s)]
*  Here she is. Um, this is I think yeah, she's at the la raid. Here's she is sought 20 [[00:34:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2093.8799999999997s)]
*  They need to leave and they need to leave right now [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2100.44s)]
*  She's in favor of the dog poop and then bill malugina fox tweeted [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2112.76s)]
*  I just spoke to border patrol chief gregory bovino who was the official on the phone with karen bass at mccarthur park today [[00:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2116.6000000000004s)]
*  I asked him for his message to her as she demands raids end quote [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2122.92s)]
*  I don't work for karen bass better get used to us now because this is going to be normal very soon [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2126.36s)]
*  We will go anywhere anytime we want in los angeles. Meantime the protesters the activists are [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2131.88s)]
*  Getting lawyers ready. They want to send lawyers to the scene. They're slashing tires of some of the federal vehicles there [[00:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2139.4s)]
*  They're throwing objects at the federal vehicles [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2145.2400000000002s)]
*  They're screaming get the f out get the f out and then of course because this is what leftists do [[00:35:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2147.2400000000002s)]
*  They dropped in the tranny to go yell to go to go yell at the ice agents [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2153.3199999999997s)]
*  Really it is it's it's another movie after we're done with missing minute at midnight. We've got tranny in mccarthur park [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2160.3599999999997s)]
*  Here it is [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2167.72s)]
*  For the listening audience it was like a goth [[00:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2176.04s)]
*  Trans trans, I don't know. I'm not sure what that was [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2178.52s)]
*  It was a man pretending to be a woman and not very convincingly andrew you enjoyed that one. Come on [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2181.72s)]
*  uh, yeah, well, um [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2186.6s)]
*  you know [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2188.68s)]
*  Carl said we talked about this on our show [[00:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2189.96s)]
*  I think that the theory of the case for the democrats right now on this the only explanation that makes sense for their position [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2191.64s)]
*  Because this is really this is what trump ran on this is what trump won on [[00:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2197.8s)]
*  This is one of those sort of 70 30 80 20 issues [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2202.04s)]
*  Um [[00:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2205.4s)]
*  But their theory is that the trump administration will go too far [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2206.6000000000004s)]
*  And there will be a reaction against ice against tom homan [[00:36:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2211.48s)]
*  And that they will sort of catch that wave. That's the only sort of political explanation for it all [[00:36:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2216.44s)]
*  I'm not i'm not saying they're right [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2222.6000000000004s)]
*  But I think that if you're looking for an explanation of how [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2224.76s)]
*  The democrats especially progressive democrats, especially progressive democratic mayors [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2228.76s)]
*  Are taking this position which seems so out of touch with all [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2233.4s)]
*  american voters [[00:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2237.96s)]
*  That seems to be at least a plausible explanation whether they [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2239.7200000000003s)]
*  You know whether they're right or not. I I don't know [[00:37:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2245.0s)]
*  but um that that seems to be what they're betting and if you take if you if you [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2247.96s)]
*  Believe that the idea of trying to provoke an overreaction on the part of ice [[00:37:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2252.2000000000003s)]
*  Is part of the strategy [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2257.88s)]
*  So these protests are designed to make ice overreact and to the extent that they don't [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2260.2000000000003s)]
*  We see pictures like that which are like, oh they look ridiculous and it is ridiculous [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2266.6s)]
*  But at some point someplace they're going to get that photo op of an ice [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2271.96s)]
*  agent or [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2276.84s)]

*  Uh, particularly these mayors of these big cities against trump against ice even this [[00:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2363.58s)]
*  The other story out of california this morning which goes along with this is that the the state of california refused the trump administration demand [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2368.7s)]

*  federal law and and executive orders from the federal government [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2388.22s)]
*  What happens next? [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2393.1s)]
*  And we we you know pam bondi who we just talked about a lot [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2395.66s)]
*  This is a way for her to sort of get her stock going back up [[00:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2399.58s)]
*  I mean she will be involved the attorney general will be involved in bringing cases against these municipalities in these states [[00:40:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2401.74s)]
*  Because they're just outright defying the the administration and and in many cases it's insurrection. It's a little insurrection. That's exactly right [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2408.46s)]
*  She they're doing california the thing that trump kept getting accused of doing disregarding federal court orders, but actually never did [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2416.54s)]

*  Which is the story that the democrats were advised that they need to be part of the resistance and be willing to get shot [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2432.14s)]
*  Quote unquote get shot [[00:40:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2438.14s)]

*  basically to the death almost [[00:40:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2445.8199999999997s)]
*  and put their their lives on the line to resist the trump administration, this is a [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2448.4599999999996s)]
*  It's almost like a mental illness the way that folks on the left are are see this administration and they've just been [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2452.7000000000003s)]

*  Mm-hmm the except the problem with like the get shot plan in addition to you could get shot [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2474.06s)]
*  Is um, you'd have to do the full trump, you know [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2479.5s)]
*  You'd have to get shot and then you'd have to stand up and you'd have to say fight fight fight [[00:41:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2482.06s)]
*  And show total courage in the moment. You couldn't writhe around in pain [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2486.14s)]

*  He's now as you point out telling the federal government to pound sand [[00:42:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2561.34s)]

*  But at the same time and you tell me not unrelated [[00:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2583.42s)]
*  He's traveling as every california governor does or any governor really in this union to south carolina [[00:43:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2586.86s)]
*  To tour eight different counties and make speeches there because that's really what he mentions those wildfires [[00:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2593.2599999999998s)]
*  You know, the california governor should be really focused on rebuilding la [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2600.46s)]
*  Nothing's been rebuilt. Absolutely. Nothing all the red tape that he said he'd get rid of is still there. No one's rebuilding [[00:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2604.7s)]
*  And he's going to south carolina guys because [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2611.02s)]
*  Well, why I mean I even even for uh would be presidential canada isn't 20 25 [[00:43:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2614.46s)]
*  A little early in the cycle [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2620.7799999999997s)]
*  Megan you could win a bar bet. Um when joe biden pronounced, um george w bush's [[00:43:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2624.22s)]
*  Um presidency a failure and when he started campaigning remember not south carolina than new hampshire [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2630.8599999999997s)]
*  Um, it was st. Patrick's day [[00:43:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2636.62s)]
*  2001 so george w bush had been president for like eight weeks [[00:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2640.2799999999997s)]
*  So actually gavin has waited a decent interval compared to some [[00:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2645.2599999999998s)]
*  Some [[00:44:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2649.9s)]
*  Wow [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2651.5s)]
*  Well, yeah, because the uh, the democrats decided that new hampshire was too white to go first [[00:44:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2652.38s)]
*  And so they had to think it's too cold up there south carolina campaign in a more fun. I would count votes [[00:44:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2657.98s)]
*  Iowa can't count votes and also too white iowa too white new hampshire too white south carolina had to be south carolina or maybe georgia [[00:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2663.5s)]
*  But they chose south carolina. So he's going there. I don't I have to tell you [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2670.2200000000003s)]
*  I don't think gavin newsom is the great white hope of the democratic party [[00:44:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2674.2200000000003s)]
*  I really don't I don't I don't see it happening. Am I am I wrong? I realize he's got the widow's peak [[00:44:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2678.22s)]
*  That's in his favor. He's got the gravity voice the united states. Well, if you think so [[00:44:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2684.14s)]
*  Oh, yeah [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2689.58s)]
*  Megan that's my sway. That's my story and i'm stuck with it because [[00:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2690.7s)]
*  They've been these two guys have been beating the crap out of me for months. Do you think he does hand-to-hand combat with rom emmanuel and wins? [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2695.26s)]
*  Well, you know what we think rom we actually are pretty bullish on rom too. Yes, i'm bullish on rom. Yeah [[00:45:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2702.9399999999996s)]
*  Rom's I don't know. I mean, yeah, tom knows tom's chicago. So he he knows he pays attention to ram's faults. Yes [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2710.3799999999997s)]
*  I'm about you like basheer out of kentucky. He's he's making noise now about like he might [[00:45:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2719.58s)]
*  He used to like I don't think basheer [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2725.2599999999998s)]
*  I thought basheer could do it because he's a he's a blue governor in a red state kentucky [[00:45:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2727.1s)]
*  But the more I listen to him the more i'm like he can't do it. He seems pathetic and weak. I'm sorry, but like [[00:45:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2731.66s)]
*  The reason I like rom emmanuel as the democratic nominee, you know, i'm not gonna vote for rom emmanuel [[00:45:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2737.66s)]
*  But my point is like why I would put money on him at this point [[00:45:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2742.62s)]
*  Is he's strong? [[00:45:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2746.46s)]
*  He's strong gavin newson's not strong. He's french laundry. He's too pretty [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2747.98s)]
*  He's too needy of like the good opinion of people like charlie who I love but like [[00:45:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2753.1s)]
*  As a democrat you shouldn't be looking for approval from steve bannon and charlie. He's just too he's a little too effete [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2758.14s)]
*  But rom emmanuel, you know rom dead fish emmanuel as his hannity used to call him [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2763.5s)]
*  I think that could work for him in an era where we are starting to respect strength again [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2768.3s)]
*  Wait a minute. Wait a minute rom was a ballet dancer. Gavin newson played the first base at santa clara [[00:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2773.98s)]
*  I'm gonna i'm gonna push back on your feet thing a little bit [[00:46:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2779.5s)]
*  He is i'm sorry. Why is he dining a french laundry to begin with that's that's a feat. He has a winery up there [[00:46:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2782.7799999999997s)]
*  It makes sense. Also a feat [[00:46:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2789.58s)]
*  Rom's got you know, he cut off his finger so [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2793.74s)]
*  See he does definitely has it look I just don't know [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2797.98s)]

*  Don't forgot even ran for president [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2826.3s)]
*  Uh the senator from colorado, but it was bernie and elizabeth warren and joe biden and you know everybody [[00:47:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2828.3s)]

*  The party is too far to the left in the primary rom has baggage and he's going to try and run as a centrist [[00:47:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2837.5s)]
*  Now maybe the progressives will you know, there'll be four or five people they split that vote and he squeaks through [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2842.54s)]
*  As as the only sort of centrist alternative, but I just don't know [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2847.5s)]
*  Uh, you know he the baggage that he has is pretty severe [[00:47:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2851.58s)]
*  He covered up the the shooting of laquan mcdonald in chicago african-american teen and we shot 16 times by by chicago police [[00:47:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2855.9s)]
*  Uh, and folks have never forgiven him for that and that will be brought up immediately and and forever during a campaign [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2863.1s)]
*  And so I I just don't know if he's going to be able to get through and then the other thing [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2869.58s)]
*  Let's be honest ram emmanuel is a jewish man [[00:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2874.38s)]
*  And the democratic party has become very anti-semitic. It just has I mean, I think they're genuinely anti-semitic [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2877.8199999999997s)]
*  I really do but they're definitely anti israel. That's for sure [[00:48:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2884.22s)]
*  You saw that poll that came out earlier this week with harry enton like marveling at this shift in support within the dem party for israel [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2887.58s)]
*  How it used to be high double digits before and now it's high double digits the other way toward palestine [[00:48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2894.54s)]
*  Plus remember this is why we all I listen to you guys all the time and you were you couldn't believe that josh shapiro [[00:48:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2899.82s)]
*  Wasn't the pick for kamala and we all knew it was because he's jewish. He's not even like some huge israel guy [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2905.34s)]
*  He was he's jewish. So that's something sadly that ram is going to have to contend with keep going [[00:48:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2911.5s)]
*  And what's the other thing that you guys are saying about ram? [[00:48:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2917.34s)]
*  Yeah, no, I was just gonna say [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2921.58s)]
*  That you know one of the other characters is [[00:48:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2924.2200000000003s)]
*  You know if it's if it's not going to be rom if it's not going to be gavin [[00:48:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2927.42s)]
*  Then who's it going to be and you look at the people who are potentially running and you know jb pritzker decided [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2930.3s)]
*  He's going to run for reelection in governor for governor of illinois, but that doesn't preclude him if he wins in 2026 [[00:48:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2934.54s)]
*  Of running in 20 he'll have to turn right around and run but we've seen that happen before [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2940.1400000000003s)]
*  He certainly thinks of himself as presidential material [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2944.1400000000003s)]
*  president there I said, oh [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2946.7799999999997s)]
*  Meg he's on he I think he's on a zempik. Yeah, I mean he's on the show that you know [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2949.02s)]
*  I think he's already starting to lose weight [[00:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2953.2599999999998s)]
*  I've seen no evidence of that. He's like two chris christie's [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2955.66s)]
*  Two obese and he's too in love with transing children that mainly that issue cost the democrats the white house this the last time around [[00:49:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2960.7s)]
*  There was a survey. I mean he's 3 000 people [[00:49:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2968.7799999999997s)]
*  The number one issue for the for the swing state voters was that was the trans issue and that ad [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2971.98s)]
*  And he he loves those his whole family the pritzker's they love transing the children the children in particular [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2977.3399999999997s)]
*  And getting this into schools and getting this health care. He'll just be demolished. He'll be eaten alive [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2983.74s)]
*  I feel for you out there in chicago god. You've got some [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2987.42s)]
*  Get some real leaders some real gems out there tom bevin [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2990.2999999999997s)]
*  I can't believe you've lasted [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2994.06s)]
*  I got all these kids in school. I can't I can't it's like trying to escape the death star out here. I can't do it [[00:49:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=2996.06s)]
*  Here's the one upshot of it. I gotta take a break [[00:50:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3002.38s)]
*  But the one upshot is if your kids are with you and they're in a woke school you can inoculate them [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3004.22s)]
*  You know against the insanity so that then when they go off to college or left-wing corporations, they know what they're being spun [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3009.98s)]
*  Uh, so that's the one upside. All right, stand by [[00:50:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3016.14s)]
*  President trump just commented on epstein. We have that right after this [[00:50:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3018.54s)]

*  Your memo and release yesterday in jeffrey ebstein it left some lingering mystery [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3096.94s)]
*  Of one of the biggest ones is whether he ever worked for a american or foreign intelligence agency [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3101.9s)]
*  the former labor secretary who was [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3109.18s)]
*  Miami u.s. Attorney [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3111.82s)]
*  Alex costa he allegedly said that he did work for an intelligence agency [[00:51:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3114.22s)]
*  So could you resolve whether or not he did and also can you say why there was a minute missing from the jailhouse tape? [[00:51:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3118.78s)]
*  On the night of the set. Yeah, sure. If I could I just enter a little second [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3124.46s)]

*  Also to the tens of thousands of video they turned out to be child porn downloaded by that disgusting jeffrey ebstein [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3192.54s)]
*  Child porn is what they were never going to be released never going to see the light of day [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3200.3s)]
*  To him being an agent. I have no knowledge about that [[00:53:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3204.94s)]
*  We can get back to you on that and the minute missing from the video we released the video showing [[00:53:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3208.06s)]
*  definitively [[00:53:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3216.04s)]
*  The video was not conclusive [[00:53:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3217.2599999999998s)]
*  but the [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3219.98s)]
*  Evidence prior to it was showing he committed suicide and what was on that? [[00:53:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3221.82s)]
*  There was a minute that was off the counter and what we learned from bureau of prisons was every year every [[00:53:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3227.34s)]
*  Night they redo that video is old from like 1999. So every night the video is [[00:53:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3233.82s)]
*  Reset and every night should have the same minute missing [[00:53:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3239.8s)]
*  So we're looking for that video to release that as well showing that a minute is missing every night and that's it on epstein [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3243.42s)]

*  President trump had the same problem there that caroline levitt had yesterday the dodge should not be obvious [[00:54:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3262.06s)]
*  It should be subtle. It should be deftly worked in to a more substantive answer [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3268.86s)]
*  It shouldn't be hold on [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3274.46s)]
*  I want to answer that before you answer that my underling [[00:54:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3276.94s)]

*  That is unbelievable that you want to waste the time [[00:54:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3288.86s)]

*  and then [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3299.5800000000004s)]
*  What is she saying? [[00:55:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3300.94s)]
*  I meant the file the the question was unambiguous list client list john roberts couldn't have asked it any more acutely [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3303.34s)]
*  um client list she didn't say [[00:55:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3310.46s)]
*  The the the file she said it in response is sitting on my desk [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3313.1000000000004s)]
*  Okay, but now she says I meant the file [[00:55:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3316.86s)]
*  then [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3319.5s)]
*  What we found was tens of thousands of pictures of child pornography as I said that my my deduction was correct [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3320.7000000000003s)]
*  And then she says by that disgusting jeffrey epstein. She does this in all of her interviews. She takes a little pivot [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3328.06s)]
*  She goes down a little little tributary to try to waste time [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3334.7000000000003s)]
*  Talking about how he's so disgusting. There was one from july. I'm sorry, uh, february 26th where [[00:55:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3338.94s)]

*  Trust me as a lawyer i've seen it a million times here. It is in sot 12 [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3363.82s)]
*  I think it's in here. I haven't seen the final cut of this sot [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3366.3s)]
*  Said last week that you have the epstein files on your desk is when can we see them and what's taking so long to release them? [[00:56:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3369.02s)]

*  and [[00:56:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3392.7s)]
*  Their personal information but other than that I think tomorrow, you know the personal information of victims other than that [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3393.58s)]
*  I think tomorrow jesse breaking news right now. You're gonna see some epstein information being released by my office [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3400.7799999999997s)]
*  What kind are we going to see who is on the flights? [[00:56:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3408.7799999999997s)]
*  Are we going to see any evidence from what he recorded because he had all of his homes wired with recording devices [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3412.2999999999997s)]
*  What you're going to see? [[00:56:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3419.58s)]
*  Hopefully tomorrow is um a lot of flight logs a lot of names a lot a lot of information [[00:57:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3421.18s)]
*  but um [[00:57:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3428.14s)]
*  It's it's pretty sick what that man did. Okay. Well along with his co-defendant [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3429.34s)]
*  Absolutely, and he had help that's for sure did [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3434.84s)]
*  Okay [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3439.5s)]
*  That was the night before the influencer event [[00:57:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3440.54s)]
*  She was not saying we have no names. She was already saying we have videos [[00:57:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3443.1800000000003s)]
*  So when she's saying more information is coming, which she then doubled down again on in march [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3447.58s)]
*  She'd already revealed that there were these, you know pornography things that weren't going to be released. They're not going to release anything involving [[00:57:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3452.3s)]
*  The actual victims names, which of course we all know everybody knows that [[00:57:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3458.7s)]
*  She's teasing something else and she does these side tributaries of he's disgusting. It's so gross [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3462.46s)]
*  What a pervert that's filler. There's a reason she's doing that. I'm telling you what it's telling us is she's nervous [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3469.18s)]
*  And the truth is not her friend for whatever reason. I don't know. I wish I did [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3476.46s)]
*  But what that tells me is the truth is not her friend [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3480.86s)]
*  That's why she's using filler even to the moment where this new york post in the cabinet meeting reporter asked her [[00:58:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3483.34s)]
*  And she's going on about how once again tens of thousands that disgusting jeffrey epstein [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3489.1800000000003s)]
*  um, and then [[00:58:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3494.38s)]
*  And it's not ever going to be released as if anybody who's criticizing them is like, let me see the child pornography [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3496.0600000000004s)]
*  Literally, nobody's saying that this is straw man, right? They're trying to be like [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3502.94s)]
*  Inappropriate no one's asking to see that stuff. We know we don't we can't we don't want [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3507.96s)]
*  To see any of that, but she's acting like that's the issue when it's not which is another tell [[00:58:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3513.34s)]
*  I have no information on him being an agent. What's that's been out there since we knew the name jeffrey [[00:58:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3517.7400000000002s)]
*  Epstein i'll look into it now you're gonna look into it and then [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3522.78s)]
*  The the minute before midnight guys our film came up the minute before midnight is actually a thing she confessed to it [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3527.34s)]
*  And then actually said some nonsense about how the video's not conclusive [[00:58:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3535.26s)]
*  What I don't think that's the fbi's stance [[00:58:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3539.98s)]
*  I think the fbi based on watching dan boncino and fox and friends a couple weeks ago thinks it is conclusive [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3542.94s)]
*  She says the video is not conclusive [[00:59:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3549.02s)]
*  But evidence prior to it was [[00:59:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3551.1s)]
*  huh [[00:59:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3553.6600000000003s)]
*  What evidence what no one knows what the hell you're talking about and then she talks about how every night the bureau of prisons [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3554.7000000000003s)]
*  Close like redoes the videotape so they lose the minute before midnight every night [[00:59:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3561.9s)]
*  Which if that's verified by looking at other tapes will only cause more questions because everybody's gonna say [[00:59:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3567.42s)]
*  Oh, so they knew they had one minute at midnight to get in and get out and it could be [[00:59:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3573.26s)]
*  Explained by the fact that they like none of that clarified anything [[00:59:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3578.62s)]
*  your thoughts [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3583.82s)]
*  well, I think it certainly makes that minute all the more interesting because [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3585.7400000000002s)]
*  As you say, I mean that didn't help at all [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3590.14s)]
*  And I think I understood exactly what she was saying was which is that [[00:59:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3592.7799999999997s)]
*  This is standard operating procedure that there's a minute before midnight that isn't taped every night [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3596.38s)]
*  And what we're going to do is show you that that is consistent over other nights as if that sort of explains it [[01:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3600.7s)]
*  so [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3607.18s)]
*  So the the accusation isn't that oh someone eliminated a minute before midnight. It's almost worse [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3608.14s)]
*  It's like oh, they know that there's one minute that isn't taped every night [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3613.58s)]
*  and so [[01:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3618.7799999999997s)]
*  You know, I mean this is catnip for conspiracy, right? [[01:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3619.98s)]
*  I mean now we know the people who worked in the prison would know about this weird thing that you're not taping for a minute [[01:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3622.7s)]
*  So they would know that they they were the only people who would know that can you kill a guy in a minute? [[01:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3629.26s)]
*  I guess we'll find out they will they'll have the trump administration will be all over the map on that too. But [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3634.14s)]
*  This this is this is a mess megan. You're right. It's just just i'm i'm even less of a conspiracy theorist than you are [[01:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3639.9s)]
*  I just assume [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3647.1s)]
*  that that you know [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3648.94s)]
*  Conspiracy sophisticated conspiracies by evil actors and you know hundreds of people in on it. No [[01:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3651.58s)]
*  Um incompetent people who then covered their ass. Yes, but [[01:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3657.2400000000002s)]
*  Why would she just say that why would she say that that minute is not taped every night? [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3661.9s)]
*  What what is that? She should have taken trump's lead followed his lead [[01:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3666.3s)]
*  Do you even want to answer that the proper answer according to the president would have been no [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3671.82s)]
*  This is let's move on but she had to because she's getting beaten up in the press tom and there's no question [[01:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3677.26s)]
*  She just made it worse [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3683.58s)]
*  She did but to me the most interesting thing was trump. I mean [[01:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3686.2200000000003s)]
*  Of course [[01:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3691.5s)]
*  We've been everybody's been talking about epstein. It's never gone away [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3692.6200000000003s)]
*  Elon musk just mentioned his name connected with epstein like it was a big deal like a week ago [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3695.34s)]
*  They announced on sunday night. There's no there's no case. Of course [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3699.98s)]
*  We're going to be talking about it. He's like, oh, this is a desecration. I'm like what since when [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3704.46s)]
*  Since when it was so obvious trump didn't even sound persuasive tom, you know when when trump's genuinely annoyed that something comes up [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3710.14s)]
*  You know, you know big daddy's not afraid of being like f off you you nasty reporter [[01:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3717.34s)]
*  This was him like I am indignant that you would bring up jeffrey epstein when there are more important subjects [[01:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3723.18s)]
*  Weird yeah. No, that was that was weird [[01:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3730.78s)]
*  He just didn't know what's happening about it megan [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3734.3s)]
*  He just was trying to get her to be quiet. She he just didn't want her to answer the question [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3737.02s)]
*  Yes, she she she was too thick to take the lead [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3741.1000000000004s)]
*  I know I know but you would know that that's going to be question number one at this press conference [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3744.6200000000003s)]
*  That's why we talked about at the top of your show. I mean, it's it's a very big important story [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3748.6200000000003s)]
*  It was not a press conference. It was a cabinet meeting. I mean, so I you better be careful megan. He's going to make you attorney general [[01:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3756.2200000000003s)]
*  Oh god [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3763.02s)]
*  He doesn't want me i'm starting to really miss matt gates. I have to say why do we lose him so quickly? [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3764.22s)]
*  Why do we roll over on that so fast? I don't look I i'm rooting for the president [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3769.1s)]
*  I am a supporter of the president, but this is not going well and and [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3774.14s)]
*  they need a shift in strategy and I really think what needs to happen is [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3778.06s)]
*  I volunteer to do it because I am not conspiratorial [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3783.02s)]
*  But I totally understand the the epstein case very well and why people have questions about it [[01:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3785.74s)]
*  I'll sit down with all three of them. Give me bondi patelle and bungino for two hours [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3790.2999999999997s)]
*  Nothing, no holds barred. I can ask anything and then the audience can see whether they're truth-tellers. I'm honestly like this [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3796.2999999999997s)]
*  Seriously megan you could charge pay-per-view for that you'd make a fortune [[01:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3803.18s)]
*  And I care about them. I don't know pam as well, but though I know pam I don't dislike pam [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3807.58s)]
*  I really don't we go back years at fox news dan is the only one who I consider an actual personal friend [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3811.9s)]
*  Um, but the audience knows that and I hope is coloring, you know that in on assessing my own bias on this [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3817.26s)]
*  but I have I whatever I [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3823.5s)]
*  This is why you have to sort of [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3826.54s)]
*  Keep some distance between yourself and the administration even when they're your friends [[01:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3829.1s)]
*  You have to be able to report honestly on them and to be called to call out bullshit when you think you smell it [[01:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3832.38s)]
*  And uh, I think I smell it and i'm nowhere near dog poop playground. So I I think it's coming from washington dc [[01:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3837.5s)]
*  Um, okay, let's keep going what a day. This is so crazy. I can't I can't quite believe this. Um [[01:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3843.9s)]
*  Okay, let's move on to mum danny. Okay this guy [[01:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3850.94s)]
*  Everything's coming out about him now and it does seem that in addition to being a genuinely terrible person [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3857.9s)]
*  Andrew cuomo had the absolute worst research team in politics [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3864.94s)]
*  Why are we learning about all this stuff guys now after the guy already won the nomination [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3870.3s)]
*  andrew [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3876.62s)]
*  Well, uh, yeah, we talked about this on our show andrew cuomo wrote ran one of the [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3878.14s)]
*  Quintessentially worst campaigns, uh, you could possibly run it was bad on every level including as you point out the oppo research on [[01:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3883.4s)]
*  On uh who would end up, you know winning the nomination in this weird? [[01:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3891.9s)]
*  Uh, you know, uh five-way, uh sort of uh, you know race that they ran up there where you count the the votes um [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3896.62s)]
*  uh, you know [[01:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3904.3799999999997s)]
*  Proportionally and all that sort of stuff. So um, yeah, no, I think but I think what's interesting about mom danny [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3905.58s)]
*  Is that he is a old school? [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3912.2999999999997s)]
*  socialism socialist and he's sort of bringing [[01:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3914.8399999999997s)]
*  That idea of socialism back from this sort of cultural socialism that we've seen [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3917.5s)]
*  In recent years that were sort of all based around sort of interest groups and and uh identity politics [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3922.86s)]
*  Back to sort of you know, the roots of socialism which are you know, and he talked about he's talked about [[01:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3928.7000000000003s)]
*  Controlling the means of production which is a phrase that you know [[01:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3933.98s)]
*  You haven't heard that in america since the 60s, right? I mean that's that's old school. That's you know, that's what bernie sanders [[01:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3937.7400000000002s)]
*  uh talked about before he sort of you know became a [[01:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3945.1800000000003s)]
*  Cultural marxist himself and he tweeted from each according from from uh, each according to his ability to those according to their means [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3948.7000000000003s)]
*  That's the carl marx quote. I don't have it quite right according to their needs. Yes [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3954.86s)]
*  So so yeah [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3958.94s)]
*  I mean this and to me and this goes back to our previous discussion about who's going to end up with the democratic nomination [[01:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3959.7400000000002s)]
*  All the energy in the democratic party. I think is on the left [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=3966.06s)]

*  You know, like I say, I think I think what's interesting about him is this idea? [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4005.1s)]
*  that he is going back to [[01:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4009.74s)]
*  the roots of socialism and [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4012.54s)]

*  Hamstrung by his many scandals. He's a shadow of his former self. He's scared. He wasn't bold [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4046.84s)]
*  He didn't take big risks. He didn't swing big. He just thought he'd like skulk along as a cuomo [[01:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4053.02s)]
*  He's nothing like his father [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4059.58s)]
*  He keeps thinking we're gonna think he's mario cuomo who was legitimately very popular in new york where I live my whole life [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4061.7400000000002s)]

*  Okay, I don't really want a hardcore marxist [[01:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4132.78s)]
*  Who wasn't born in this country but hates this country even though this country's been so good to him and his family [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4136.3s)]
*  This guy's too much for me. Maybe [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4141.74s)]
*  Eric adams is not as bad as I thought he was maybe I can live another four years with eric adams [[01:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4143.74s)]
*  What what do you what's the vibe up there? The polls don't show it yet. But what do you what do you sense? [[01:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4148.46s)]

*  No one not eric adams not cuomo not curtis lewa. You can't get anybody else in the ballot [[01:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4158.38s)]
*  Who's got his energy and his weird like snake oil salesman vibe of like [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4164.14s)]
*  Whatever you want. You can have it. I'll get it for you. I'm gonna lower all the rents [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4169.34s)]
*  I'm gonna ruin all the billionaires, but i'm also going to tax the billionaires into oblivion to pay for all my wonderful things like free buses [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4173.02s)]
*  And i'm i'm gonna we're gonna become socialist and we are going to take from the people with means and give to people according to their needs [[01:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4180.3s)]
*  It's going to be our new utopia. We're going to have public housing right in the middle of central park [[01:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4186.38s)]
*  And that's definitely not going to affect quality of life at all for the millionaires and others who live on the park [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4190.700000000001s)]

*  um, we're not going to cooperate with ice so we're going to increase the [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4199.26s)]
*  Magnet effect that this city has on illegals who want to come here [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4203.42s)]
*  We're going to put them up in the hotels again on those billionaires dollars who are going to leave new york because they won't be taxed this way [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4207.18s)]
*  The he's a snake oil salesman, but he's got all the charm of one too [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4212.9400000000005s)]
*  And I think new yorkers who aren't paying that much attention and young people who aren't doing that well and they don't [[01:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4217.02s)]
*  It's never easy for young people in big cities ask any young person in chicago in new york in boston in san franc in la [[01:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4222.62s)]
*  They're exorbitantly expensive. We all went through it. This is not the first generation to experience that [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4230.9400000000005s)]
*  You know what we did? We got roommates [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4236.38s)]
*  We lived cheaply or we lived right on the outer part of the city [[01:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4238.54s)]
*  We don't run around complaining that the country needs to be socialist or communist and start voting in left-wing loons like this guy [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4242.86s)]
*  But I think he's going to win and and here's one other thing for you [[01:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4250.78s)]
*  David paterson [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4254.38s)]
*  The the former governor of new york puts out this long paper statement like what we really need is for the party to come together now [[01:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4255.74s)]
*  He's democrat [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4260.78s)]
*  And like select the right leader before the vote [[01:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4262.22s)]
*  And I have to hand it to crystal ball who I love but I don't agree with her politics and she doesn't agree with mine [[01:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4265.98s)]
*  Which is fine. I still like her and she tweeted out. This is bonkers [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4269.98s)]
*  This guy says new york city democrats need to come together and decide to support whichever candidate has the most support among them [[01:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4273.66s)]
*  That's a quote. They did this it was called the democratic primary and this guy's oran mumdami won it and it wasn't even particularly close [[01:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4279.5s)]
*  Their goose is cooked tom bevin [[01:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4288.219999999999s)]
*  I think I agree with you and you know, what's interesting is watching [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4291.58s)]
*  so the story that came over the weekend that that mumdami had [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4295.66s)]
*  Checked the box african-american on his applications of columbia the race box [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4298.700000000001s)]
*  Be sure you say that because it wasn't what's your national origin? [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4304.14s)]
*  It was what is your race go ahead and explain it because we haven't talked about it with our audience yet [[01:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4306.54s)]
*  Yeah, well no, so so but the leak went to the new york times [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4310.9400000000005s)]
*  So you can that just tells you there are forces inside the democratic party the establishment there's folks on wall street [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4315.820000000001s)]
*  They're all freaking out right now because it they've basically sort of enabled [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4322.700000000001s)]
*  This monster and and now they can't stop him [[01:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4328.38s)]
*  I think he's gonna win because I don't think there's gonna be enough support [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4331.02s)]
*  But they are going to try and take him down and as you said like the the oppo stuff that [[01:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4334.38s)]
*  Cuomo should have been able to to find is all coming out and it's going to be a steady drumbeat of that all the way through the election [[01:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4339.34s)]
*  But I don't I don't know that it's going to be enough to slow him down. He's a charismatic guy [[01:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4347.820000000001s)]
*  He's giving away free goodies to everybody says he's gonna, you know, it's the richest fault [[01:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4351.900000000001s)]

*  And so it's the sort of standard playbook and it is it's I mean, it's it's not just socialism. It's communism [[01:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4361.74s)]
*  I mean seizing the means of production. It is true communism [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4368.14s)]
*  And seizing the means of production. He said he wants to do that [[01:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4371.74s)]
*  I know I know so I mean he's he's literally a textbook communist. He says he's a socialist [[01:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4374.7s)]
*  He's actually a communist and you know, shaul maguire who's a venture capitalist out in silicon valley [[01:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4380.139999999999s)]
*  I don't know if you heard about this. So he tweeted out over the weekend. He actually [[01:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4385.82s)]
*  Said look, I believe he's an islamist and and of course he caught all sorts of hell for that [[01:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4389.66s)]
*  A bunch of people have signed a letter trying to get him fired [[01:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4395.5s)]
*  He went online and put in published a 28 minute video trying to explain in rational terms [[01:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4398.94s)]
*  Why he thinks that mamdani is not just a socialist. He's a communist but also an islamist [[01:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4404.139999999999s)]

*  Yeah, no, it's there there's no there's been no pushback on the on the actual facts of the case [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4794.7s)]
*  um, but you know the [[01:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4800.62s)]
*  First of all, the vanguard of the proletariat is always [[01:20:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4803.179999999999s)]
*  Comes from the elite. I mean we know that from lennon. We know that so he he's in a very [[01:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4806.78s)]
*  solid tradition of the leftist [[01:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4812.62s)]
*  It's never a truly a man of the people that comes up and and you know [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4814.62s)]
*  Runs the revolution because the proletariat are not capable of doing that. That's why you need people like mom donnie who [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4819.099999999999s)]
*  Understand the theory and everything and can actually make it happen. So in that regard [[01:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4826.0599999999995s)]
*  He fits into a he's a he's a textbook leftist in that regard [[01:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4831.099999999999s)]
*  But the other thing that I think is interesting about this right now is how much what it says about how new york might have changed [[01:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4836.0599999999995s)]
*  Because there's two million jews in new york city [[01:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4842.3s)]
*  Um, there are 800 000 muslims now which sort of shocked me. That's a bigger number than I would have expected big big [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4845.98s)]
*  Yeah, so the city has really changed and he does [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4853.74s)]
*  in terms of sort of you know, if you think of the [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4857.58s)]
*  Ethnic makeup of new york and how you know, ethics rise in politics. He fits that model in a way [[01:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4860.78s)]
*  Um, that's that's interesting and I so uh, you know to your point [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4867.66s)]
*  Originally again, I think he has a pretty good chance of pulling this off even with all [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4872.46s)]
*  The little stuff that's going to come out about his background and stuff [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4877.5s)]
*  By the way, his his wife also lies for the moment. I'm sorry. I think sadly he is but his wife also lies [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4881.0199999999995s)]
*  Her name is rama do waji [[01:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4887.26s)]

*  And she's she's from texas [[01:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4894.139999999999s)]
*  Texas [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4896.14s)]

*  I don't think so [[01:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4903.18s)]
*  That's a great deal. Yeah, yeah, they're just cosplayers what I don't understand about this [[01:21:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4905.9800000000005s)]

*  disappeared off the face of the earth [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4919.0s)]
*  Venezuela tried it and it wrecked their economy [[01:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4921.1s)]
*  And it wrecked their economy so much that the biden administration [[01:22:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4924.9400000000005s)]
*  gave 500 000 visas to venezuelans to come to the united states [[01:22:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4928.780000000001s)]
*  Because their economy was wrecked by socialism and I don't there's this disconnect between the facts of the real world in this rhetoric [[01:22:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4934.54s)]
*  Um, I guess I don't know who you blame the press the public school system. Maybe i gen z, you know [[01:22:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=4941.900000000001s)]

*  There is an affordability crisis for sure [[01:23:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5011.34s)]
*  Part of it is just you're young and you chose a very expensive place to live [[01:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5014.06s)]
*  But a lot of these cities have been run into the ground like chicago [[01:23:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5017.42s)]
*  I mean, there's no better example of it. I mean san francisco is coming back now because they hit rock bottom [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5020.3s)]
*  I think and now they're starting to realize [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5024.46s)]
*  You have to moderate or the city's going to just flush down the toilet into the ocean [[01:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5027.02s)]
*  And chicago, I mean, what does brandon johnson have an 11 approval rating tom? Even the left-wing chicagouans are realizing [[01:23:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5031.58s)]
*  He's a disaster [[01:23:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5037.58s)]
*  I think it might be lower than that actually [[01:23:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5039.26s)]
*  Wow, it's seven percent. I mean at least in look at least in new york. You guys have had republican mayors [[01:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5041.5s)]
*  I mean you had juliani had bloomberg who was you know republican than an independent chicago hasn't had a republican mayor in [[01:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5046.7s)]
*  a hundred years [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5053.18s)]
*  and republicans have no [[01:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5054.86s)]
*  Control over any of the levers of government not not just at the municipal level but at the state level as well [[01:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5057.0199999999995s)]
*  and [[01:24:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5063.9s)]
*  You know we had lori. I mean if you had told me megan four years ago that [[01:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5064.86s)]
*  Chicagoans would be pining for the days of lori lightfoot [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5069.0199999999995s)]
*  Which they are now I would have said you're crazy, but so there is no moderation [[01:24:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5072.299999999999s)]
*  There's just this constant march to the left [[01:24:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5077.179999999999s)]
*  And there are no alternatives [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5080.54s)]
*  I mean even the sane democrat who ran this last time around paul valace could not overcome the teachers unions could not overcome the [[01:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5082.38s)]
*  The sort of system that was put in place [[01:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5088.860000000001s)]
*  And and now you have a situation where you've got a mayor as I said with like six percent approval rating or something [[01:24:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5092.14s)]
*  and [[01:24:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5097.34s)]
*  But he he might win reelection. It is completely possible that he could be reelected [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5098.38s)]
*  Just because of you know, he's he's got the unions the teachers union in particular behind him [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5104.38s)]
*  I mean, that's part of the problem in these big cities [[01:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5109.5s)]
*  Is is the unionization? [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5112.38s)]
*  Uh just being completely lopsided and one-sided and that's certainly the case in chicago, by the way tom [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5114.78s)]
*  I was just looking for my papers. I can't find it. It was in my yesterday's packet [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5120.06s)]

*  I mean, oh, yeah shot and killed and and the same no one reports on it [[01:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5127.18s)]
*  It's fine the same crowd that wants us to believe like we have to defund the police because they're anti-black. That's where the whole thing came from [[01:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5132.06s)]
*  how it was [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5139.42s)]
*  Black people mostly on the south side of chicago who were [[01:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5140.86s)]
*  How many I don't have in front of me how many were killed and how many were shot? It was like 80 shot [[01:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5145.179999999999s)]
*  And it was a bunch and look [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5150.38s)]
*  I've been following shot [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5152.62s)]

*  um [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5159.259999999999s)]
*  And and multiple dead no one cares. They don't care [[01:26:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5160.54s)]
*  They don't they don't care when black people die at the hands [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5163.74s)]
*  Of other black people or hispanics at the hands of other hispanics [[01:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5167.58s)]
*  They only the left care when they can use it to indict white people [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5170.860000000001s)]
*  Cops or guns you don't hear a peep about gun violence [[01:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5176.38s)]
*  From any of this crowd in the wake of what happened in chicago, right? You don't hear any calls to have brandon johnson recalled [[01:26:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5181.66s)]
*  no in chicago has some of the the strictest gun laws in the country and [[01:26:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5188.38s)]
*  Look this has been going on for years. This was going on when barack obama was president [[01:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5193.26s)]
*  I've been i've been you know [[01:26:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5196.54s)]
*  I get up and I read the chicago papers every day and it's just to spend this constant drumbeat [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5197.42s)]
*  And you're right. I mean, it's it's confined to like a few neighborhoods couple on the south side couple on the west side [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5201.26s)]
*  Um who bear the brunt of all of this terrible violence and all the gang stuff that's going on and then you've got brandon johnson [[01:26:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5206.38s)]
*  So he just vetoed [[01:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5211.82s)]
*  Uh, uh, you know, they tried to put an ordinance in place to prevent all these kids from gathering [[01:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5213.66s)]
*  You know, it was it was a curfew for teens and he vetoed it [[01:26:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5218.78s)]
*  I mean he just there's it makes no sense [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5221.9s)]
*  And that those are the kinds of policies that you have that that allow this stuff to just you know [[01:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5225.099999999999s)]
*  Fester and and continue and there's no there's no nobody ever puts a stop to it [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5231.179999999999s)]
*  Here it is. I found my information. So if you just go [[01:27:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5236.139999999999s)]

*  It's barely being covered by the so-called legacy media. They don't care [[01:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5255.26s)]
*  They don't they actually don't think black lives matter at all [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5259.9800000000005s)]
*  They just love an opportunity to indict whitey [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5264.06s)]
*  Especially if it happens to be a cop and if the cop's black, that's fine, too [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5268.3s)]
*  They'll indict him. They they're fine throwing black cops under they hate cops of any color [[01:27:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5271.98s)]
*  But it's so obvious or they'd be reporting on this or they would care but all of this [[01:27:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5276.86s)]
*  We're looking the other way when it's black on black violence or hispanic on hispanic violence [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5282.0599999999995s)]

*  And it really is that communist mindset of like what we care about is seizing the means of production. We care about the economics [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5291.82s)]
*  Getting rid of private industry, which of course is you know, capitalism has so few defenders [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I01CAVEN7W8&t=5298.5599999999995s)]
