Video Description: Megyn Kelly is joined by Victor Davis Hanson, author of "The End of Everything," to discuss Maxine Waters and other Democratic politicians trying to storm the Department of Education, the left's outrage over bureaucratic cuts more than other cultural issues, why Americans are sick of the performative outrage, the left’s latest attempt at defiance of Trump’s executive orders, the stunning speed of the NCAA complying with Trump’s executive order banning men from competing in women’s sports, the latest terrible race-obsessed panel of yelling on CNN, one black female pundit claiming she's the most qualified but least paid there, Jasmine Crockett’s racism on CNN mocking white men, Vogue trashing Melania’s stunning First Lady portrait, Vogue calling Bianca Censori “empowering” for showing up nude to the Grammys, the contradictions in modern feminism, the cultural shift we're seeing with the new Super Bowl ads, Carl’s Jr. back to sexy women in their commercials after eight years away, Bud Light's new ad with the formerly-canceled Shane Gillis, and more. Then Mike Solana, editor of "Pirate Wires," joins to discuss the absurdity of the media’s latest meltdown over Elon Musk’s team helping to cut out government waste, the freakout over one young engineer nicknamed "Big Balls," the dishonesty of the Wired reporting around Musk and Kara Swisher's false punditry, the rise of the “tech right," how Elon influenced this shift, Mark Zuckerberg speaking out now but late to the party, the rise and fall of the left’s war on masculinity, and more.

# Dems Try To Storm Building, CNN Panel Melts Down, and Rise of "Tech Right," with VDH and Mike Solana
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [February 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show and happy Friday. We're going into Super Bowl weekend everybody [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=0.0s)]
*  I told you Doug and I are gonna go. This is the first time we've ever been [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6.92s)]
*  We were invited by the CEO of YouTube and we said yes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=10.64s)]
*  I met him when I was in Washington for the inauguration. I didn't know him and [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=15.42s)]
*  I think we had met one other time, but you know, obviously we're not enough first name basis exactly [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=20.88s)]
*  It was actually a very productive meeting [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=27.48s)]
*  I told him the things that I would love to see YouTube change and that you guys know me [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=30.28s)]
*  I was very frank and he was very respectful and I did acknowledge to him what you guys know is true [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  Which is with our show they have been very fair [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=41.76s)]
*  We've only gotten clipped a couple of times and I raised the specific issues and you guys know what those are too [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=44.84s)]
*  Because I'm not shy about it [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=49.2s)]
*  I don't like the fact that you can't describe what's being done to so-called trans children as mutilation and [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  YouTube will potentially demonetize your show will pull your show [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=55.8s)]
*  So we talked about that and I am hopeful about progress in the free speech lane [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=59.379999999999995s)]
*  Now because all of big tech I think is re-evaluating life under Donald Trump, right? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=65.2s)]
*  Anyway, we're gonna go and it'll be my very first Super Bowl. I'm very excited to do this [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=70.32s)]
*  I'm grateful for the invitation and I don't know what to expect like football [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=74.96s)]
*  but it's supposed to be like a big, you know extravaganza the whole weekend and [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=80.64s)]
*  I will have a full report for you guys of the behind-the-scenes [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=85.16s)]
*  Happenings when we get back to the show on Monday and we will have a show on Monday. I think [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=89.44s)]
*  Abby will correct me. I think it might be one of those is gonna have to drop later in the day [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=94.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, yeah 6 p.m. Steve crack our tells me because we got to fly back that day [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=99.14s)]

*  hoping I'm gonna be able to see him while he's there and [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=109.44s)]
*  And [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=112.48s)]

*  We don't even have a Trump appointed DOE chief, you know, it's Linda McMahon [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=247.92s)]

*  Which will show you exactly that not to mention the ridiculousness on CNN [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=279.0s)]
*  Okay, so we're gonna talk all about that and much much more with VDH. Victor Davis Hansen is here [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=282.76s)]

*  Don't miss a moment subscribe to this show on YouTube and follow me on insta Facebook and X [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=297.8s)]
*  This show is dedicated to uncovering the truth in a media landscape often dominated by left-leaning narratives [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=304.16s)]
*  Especially when it comes to President Trump [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=310.0s)]
*  It's safe to say you can expect more agenda driven stories and factual distortions all over the rest of the news [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=312.52000000000004s)]
*  But I do want to tell you about ground news [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=317.84000000000003s)]
*  Unlike other platforms that censor or amplify certain narratives ground news is not a news publisher [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=321.08000000000004s)]
*  They're an independent app and website that aggregates every source on a story [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=326.64s)]
*  So you can compare coverage and see through mainstream media spin [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=331.28s)]
*  Ground news has an entire blind spot feed with stories that are receiving lopsided coverage [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=336.15999999999997s)]
*  It truly reveals how media narratives are shaping the conversation [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=340.84s)]
*  My viewers are gonna get 40% off their vantage plan which gives you unlimited access to their website and their app [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=344.32s)]
*  They are independent. They are supported by a subscribers not corporate interests [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=350.2s)]
*  You can check them out at ground news comm slash Megan that's ground [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=354.2s)]
*  GROUND news comm slash Megan to take back control of the news you consume [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=359.0s)]
*  VDH welcome back. Thank you for having me Megan [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=364.88s)]
*  So I my next guest will forgive me for stealing his point for the top of the show [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=369.12s)]
*  But I think it's a really good one [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  Don't you about this is where they they really did get upset and it's actually causing protests in the street [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=375.84s)]
*  Not all the other stuff that they've been whining about for four years [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=382.2s)]
*  Yeah, I think so I but the problem they're having is that and almost every one of these issues [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  There's 70% approval rating on Trump. He's picked these issues [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=392.76s)]
*  primarily for that reason the border and [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=397.44s)]
*  Energy and cutting waste there's overwhelming support for it all [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=400.24s)]
*  So every time they say say they're gonna have a big protest or hate come Jeffries [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=405.08s)]
*  I come Jeff he says he's gonna go in the street [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=409.36s)]
*  He's not gonna go in the street Cory Booker is not gonna go in the street. There's no support for it [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=412.04s)]
*  If they're cut Social Security, yeah or Medicare. Yeah, but he's not gonna do that [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=417.36s)]
*  So this is a slow-motion suicide of the Democratic Party. They're screaming and yelling on the confirmation [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=421.92s)]
*  You've you've aired probably the the voting at the DNC that crazy. I [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=429.0s)]
*  Don't know what you would call quotas on which candidate was of which sort sexual orientation [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=434.84000000000003s)]
*  It's just they wanted non-binaries represented equally [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=439.72s)]
*  Yeah, and it's and then this meltdown over Elon Musk Elon Musk [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=442.72s)]
*  I mean the National Security Advisor of the United States doesn't have to be confirmed [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=448.0s)]
*  He serves at the the wish of the president. So Elon Musk doesn't have he's the same category and you don't during world [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=451.8s)]
*  I was just thinking during World War two FDR really turned over his foreign policy to Bernard Baruch and the Harry Hopkins [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=458.86s)]
*  They were they had no DOJ [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=465.8s)]
*  No Doge type affiliation. They were just I don't know what you'd call them senior counselors [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=468.54s)]
*  they didn't even work for the government and Harry Hopkins moved in four years into the White House and [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=474.3s)]
*  Republicans say this guy's running all the foreign policy during the war and and then if you think about the scientific stuff [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=479.9s)]
*  That Elon's trying to do and bring codeine and everything in for efficiency [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=486.54s)]
*  They just turned over the war effort on the war production board. These guys weren't elected [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=491.66s)]
*  They were not confirmed Henry Ford Henry Kaiser William Knutson. They just rebooted the entire American economy [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=496.1s)]
*  They were geniuses at what they did, but this is not new to have an advisor [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=503.22s)]
*  What's new is that he actually has a statutory authority in this new this new agency of Doge, but [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=507.70000000000005s)]
*  It I don't know what whether it's a he's an apostate and they're they're furious at him because [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=515.48s)]
*  Tesla and his wealth was used on their behalf, but [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=520.88s)]
*  They're they're just committing suicide and they're down to 31% [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=525.4s)]
*  That's the lowest in my lifetime they've ever been an approval rating [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=529.52s)]
*  And I guess they want to go down to 20 and they will get there if they keep this hysteria [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=533.4s)]
*  Here is how it looked outside of the Department of Education today where they try to get in [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=539.08s)]
*  But the security would not let them [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=543.68s)]
*  Where you told to stand here or did you decide to stand here and block members of Congress from entering the Department of Education? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=545.68s)]
*  This allows us access to federal buildings [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=550.68s)]
*  You said the Department of Justice will approve [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=552.68s)]
*  We're allowed in there [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=555.68s)]
*  So do you understand who members of Congress are? [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=557.68s)]
*  We don't care [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=559.68s)]
*  Who are we then? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=561.68s)]
*  We have a job to do [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=563.68s)]
*  We're not dangerous people. We're not, I don't know, we're security [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=565.68s)]
*  There are no thieves and thugs out here. We're members of Congress [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=569.68s)]
*  We're teachers [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=573.68s)]
*  We were elected to this [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=575.68s)]
*  This is our job [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=577.68s)]
*  This is our job, we're doing our job [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=579.68s)]
*  We're trying to request a meeting and they have a private security contractor [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=581.68s)]
*  Who on his own is making decisions on behalf of the Department of Education [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=586.68s)]
*  Look them in the eye, come on, hold your face up, look at them, let them see you [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=590.68s)]
*  This is him, look at him, what's your name? Tell us your name, give me that ID again [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=595.68s)]
*  I showed you the ID [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=601.68s)]
*  So what? [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=603.68s)]
*  I showed you the ID [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=604.68s)]
*  You do what? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=605.68s)]
*  I showed you the ID [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=606.68s)]
*  Could you let me see the ID again? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=607.68s)]
*  No [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=609.68s)]
*  No? Well someone else ask him for the ID [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=611.68s)]
*  I think I speak for everyone when I say we're on his side [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=616.68s)]
*  I mean, can you imagine if the dynamic were reversed there, Victor? [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=619.68s)]
*  And if it were a white man saying the Maxine water [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=623.68s)]
*  Get your head up, look at me [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=627.68s)]
*  Give me your ID, show it to me again, get it out [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=629.68s)]
*  She can be as disrespectful as she wants of him though [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=632.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean this isn't the first time [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=635.68s)]
*  During the first term she told everybody to bird dog and harass and get in the faces [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=637.68s)]
*  And followed Trump supporters into restaurants and stuff [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=642.68s)]
*  And then we had Al Green, I think this is the fifth time he's been screaming about impeaching Donald Trump [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=645.68s)]
*  And Ikem Jeffries who says he's a moderate but he's not, he was telling everybody to go out in the streets [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=650.68s)]
*  Cory Booker is replaying the Spartacus role of the confirmation hearing of Kavanaugh [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=657.68s)]
*  He's screaming and yelling about as if he's Winston Churchill [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=663.68s)]
*  We're going to fight on the beaches and all this [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=666.68s)]
*  It's insane and they don't understand that most people [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=668.68s)]
*  I'd say the vast majority of people are so sick of it [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=672.68s)]
*  And they just want to cut the size of government [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=676.68s)]
*  They don't want to give the BBC 8% of its budget [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=679.68s)]
*  They really don't want to do that [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=682.68s)]
*  They don't want to pay for the subscriptions of bureaucrats to Politico [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=684.68s)]
*  That's beside all the trans and gay stuff [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=688.68s)]
*  And another thing they don't mention is we're spending a lot of money to go into traditional fundamentalist societies in the Middle East and Asia [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=691.68s)]
*  And then almost as if we're 19th century pith hat British imperialists and starting to pride flag [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=700.68s)]
*  And you think that after Kabul when the pride flag was on the embassy and George Floyd murals and the gender studies [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=708.68s)]
*  They would have learned their lesson that if you really want to alienate a traditional society [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=715.68s)]
*  You don't bring in trans and gay and all of these crazy ideas [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=719.68s)]
*  You know politically correct sesame on street on Middle East TV [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=724.68s)]
*  But they're really cultural imperials [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=728.68s)]
*  That's what's so ironic about it and they turn off people overseas [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=731.68s)]
*  So when they when Elon says get rid of it it would be better for foreign relations [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=734.68s)]
*  I think he's right [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=739.68s)]
*  It's not just a 50 billion we'd say [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=740.68s)]
*  But we wouldn't be we wouldn't appear so obnoxious and sermonizing and arrogant to all of these societies that purportedly were helping [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=742.68s)]
*  The pushback I mean I don't know what she thought she was going to accomplish [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=750.68s)]
*  Just because she's a member of Congress that she can just show up and announced barge into the DOE with a bunch of civilians [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=755.68s)]
*  They don't know they haven't cleared [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=761.68s)]
*  Their intent once they get into the DOE is unclear [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=763.68s)]
*  Can you imagine what that guy what the kind of hot water he would have been into if if they just let them all in just come on in [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=766.68s)]
*  I mean now I guess this is the new standard on Capitol Hill in the wake of January 6th [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=772.68s)]
*  If you're a Democrat it's fine. You can storm the building. You can blow past security. You can harass the officers. That's that's all good [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=775.68s)]
*  I mean I was told that was really bad and insurrection II but I guess Maxine waters can get away with it [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=782.68s)]
*  So that's one thing because they're going to cut federal jobs and that's what she's really upset about [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=787.68s)]
*  But there is meanwhile some civil disobedience [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=792.68s)]
*  I don't know what you want to call it in response to some of Trump's reforms and starting to crop up already [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=796.68s)]
*  Yesterday we talked about how in New York State the attorney general ordered hospitals not to comply with Trump's executive order [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=803.68s)]
*  Banning these trans procedures on minors. He said you cannot give the puberty blockers in the cross-sex hormones and you cannot do the surgeries [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=814.68s)]
*  And she said if you don't do all those things and why you let go which stopped doing it in the wake of Trump's order [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=821.68s)]
*  I'll sue you for a violation of our anti-discrimination anti and pro equal protection laws [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=829.68s)]
*  So far they appear to be holding a line complying with the president [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=835.68s)]
*  Now today you get what yesterday you had Trump's executive order on banning boys from girls sports and California has come out today to say we won't comply [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=839.68s)]
*  We're not we're not following that we don't believe in it [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=850.68s)]
*  We want the boys in the sports and we're going to keep doing it [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=854.68s)]
*  And then on top of all that you have Tom Homan trying to go city to city get out the worst of the worst immigrants [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=857.68s)]
*  Immigrants illegal immigrants for which there's overwhelming support by both parties to deport the criminal illegals the ones who have committed additional crimes in addition to being here illegally [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=866.68s)]
*  And and he's trying to get out Venezuelan gang members out of this Colorado town and somebody leaked that he was about to be there with his deportation force [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=874.68s)]
*  And they went apartment to apartment in this building and they were empty and Tom Homan says heads will roll [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=885.68s)]
*  Well clearly there is subterfuge afoot here Victor amongst many both in official positions and not to try to stop the people's mandate [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=891.68s)]
*  Yeah the problem with this is say here in California we're no different if you look at polls on you know trans women and female sports it's about 70 percent against it [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=901.68s)]
*  If you look at trans surgeries for minors it's about 80 percent against it if you look at deportation of criminals it's about 70 percent for it [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=914.68s)]
*  So in almost every one of these issues they're on the wrong side and then when they what they're really frustrated about Megan is they don't have the White House they don't have the house they do not have the Senate [[00:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=924.68s)]
*  They do not have the Supreme Court they don't have public support on any of these issues they have no power of subpoena they can no no power to block confirmation [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=935.68s)]
*  They're completely impotent and that was their own doing and they're very frustrated because they have given a sample paradigm blueprint through Joe Biden's executive orders [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=944.68s)]
*  And his pressing the limits of what a president can do and it came right into Trump's hands and he said you know Biden did all of this stuff then I guess he set a precedent [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=956.68s)]
*  And they've really shot themselves in the foot and this is not going to go well because we have federal laws and this is Confederate nullification we have 600 sanctuary jurisdictions and technically they're all they're all breaking federal law [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=966.68s)]
*  And state the Constitution is very clear that state law does not surpass a federal law and they can't defy it we we settle that in the Civil War and believe me Megan if you a county in Wyoming or Utah said you know what we are a sanctuary gun city and we're not going to require any federal handgun registration [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=985.68s)]
*  And the Endangered Species Act does not apply here they would go crazy they would say that's neo-confederate you're defying federal law so all he and he because he has this power and they have none Trump can just say pick which federal program you don't want but you're breaking federal law so I have no I have no intention of extending federal money to you until you comply and I think the courts will probably back him up on that and [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1004.68s)]
*  California exactly what program what college program are they funneling these trans students into because the NCAA came out after Trump's executive order saying we will comply 100% boys are no longer welcome to play in girls sports under the moniker trance sorry but we're complying and they seem to me relieved to finally have had somebody at the federal level give very clear guidance before it was okay let each individual sport decide whether it's fair or not you can see that [[00:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1030.68s)]
*  these athletic organizations like the NCAA were trying themselves and not trying not to be the one to say we want a blanket ban I mean within 2 seconds this guy said yeah we'll do what Trump said so I think you think of it you're out in California you're on a girls volleyball team half the team is boys posing as girls and the college recruiters come well guess what not a single one of those boys is going to be able to play college volleyball for girls [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1060.68s)]
*  not a single one so what does that mean are they more likely to go visit your team I would venture to say no they're actually probably not that interested in you because they know you're mostly boys not girls and they're out recruiting for girls and what happens to those trans kids so so-called trans kids nothing they won't be playing college athletics if they don't do something to just activate a lane for trans people that's what they should be working on a meaningful lane for trans people to play sports in their own lane or they can play as what they are biological boys but [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1090.68s)]
*  instead we have this defiance which makes them feel good Victor but sets no one up for success yeah I mean we're here in California we got about a hundred billion dollar bill minimum to get Los Angeles ready for the Olympics and they're going to need a massive infusion of federal money and you can see Gavin Newsom he bent the knee almost immediately when he saw Trump they understand that Trump doesn't have to make a big deal of it he just has to say if I'm going to give you this federal money I'm going to send [[00:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1120.68s)]
*  Rick Grenell out he's going to watch over and he's got public support there's such a backlash right now about the DEI and what happened in Los Angeles I don't want to prejudge what happened at Reagan Airport but there's enough information to suggest that there was non-mericratic hiring and the FAA and they're on the wrong side of every one of these issues and now people are starting to get really angry about it and I think what's also missed here is when Donald Trump came [[00:19:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1150.68s)]
*  into office they were very confident because they thought that they could infiltrate the administrative state as remember anonymous said he was going to stop Trump from the inside we had Venman doing it we had Rex Tillerson calling Trump stupid we had Jim Mattis we had all of these guys and they and Trump got wise and he said you know what I'm not going to have any of them I'm going to have people that are more MAGA than I am and I'm going to turn them loose and and they can't handle that they're looking for some interior person [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1180.68s)]
*  maybe the Secretary of State maybe the Secretary of Defense can sabotage it like we used to do but there's no one there and so they don't have any power now and I've never seen such asymmetry and they're just getting angrier because they're used to being coddled and they're losing the media now they don't know what to do with your podcast Joe Rogan's they have no idea how to compete with that they're losing lawsuits for the first time big lawsuits and it's like the whole [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1210.68s)]
*  rep that whole revolution is now meeting a counter revolution cultural social economic political kind of like the reaction against the Jacobins and Robespierre and the French Revolution all of a sudden people said you know what I'm not going to change the date of the French Republic I'm not going to tear down statues I'm not going to behead anybody anymore and the people who did it are going to account for this and the whole country rose up within a matter of weeks and this is what it's kind of like this was all a mystique a bad dream we've been in a coma and now we're [[00:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1240.68s)]
*  waking up and people said I can't believe we did that I can't believe we have these crazy pronouns on email I can't believe we have this trans 0.001 of the population we claim 20% of kids want to transition this was a collective madness and now we're waking up and I think the only thing I don't know I don't know how far right were the counter revolution is going to go but people it hasn't gone it hasn't really fully expressed itself yet I agree oh I [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1270.68s)]
*  love what you said yeah it's like the fever broke that's how it feels you know like we're all in this horrible sick period and now the fever broke and we're out and we can live normally and but there's hanger on hangers on who enjoyed the fever you know the ones who love misery they're miserable and they want you to be too and most of them are at MSNBC and CNN and so there's you can see them holding on to the last vestiges of woke ism like no I won't let it go it made me feel superior and better than you and I'm gonna give you a couple of examples of [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1300.68s)]
*  that just to prove my point I'll start on CNN where a trans athlete activist named Chris Mosier had the following to say in sat 13 there's no evidence that trans athletes have an advantage over anyone else in sports trans athletes play sports for the same reasons as anybody else for our love of the game to be a part of a team to challenge ourselves and most of all for the youth level to have fun and [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1330.68s)]
*  every young person deserves that opportunity to be their authentic self and to play the sports that they love without compromising any part of who they are okay so there's no evidence that trans athletes have a pathological yeah that's a pathological lie he knows well that a trans woman that was a biological male has not only hurt people but wins records they otherwise would not in a male and he knows that women who transit transition into men [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1360.68s)]
*  have no record of consistent success against biological males they don't they don't win anything so when we talk about trans sports abuses we're always talking about biological males that say they're women and they're competing against women we're never talking about women who say now they're males and I can beat regular you know not males it doesn't happen or if it does happen it's almost so rare that nobody even knows about it so when he says there's no difference [[00:23:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1390.68s)]
*  he knows if it there was no difference we would have this argument right now oh my god we've got all of these transitioning males that have female bodies and they're just sweeping all of these swimming and track contests look at this happen look at leah thomas towering towering over his competitor I can't is that Riley I can't even tell that's yeah that was with whom he tied for fifth place in that infamous race in which they let him hold the trophy not her but look at this guy I mean he's look at this Victor [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1420.68s)]
*  this is from the NCAA championships a couple years ago he's towering over them he was in the 500s in his ranking as a male the previous season he crossed over to female they let him play without doing anything and he dominated he won he was in first place in many of these races just not for nothing but female athletes have lost nearly 900 medals to transgender rivals competing against them in women's sport according to the United Nations the study [[00:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1450.68s)]
*  called violence against women and girls in sports stated that more than 600 female athletes have been bested at various events by competitors born male let's see 600 info in more than 400 competitions have lost more than 890 medals in 29 different sports and yet CNN wants to let this person get on there and say there's no evidence that trans athletes have an advantage over any I mean our eyes belie the claim so why would CNN do that Victor why are why are they doing that [[00:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1480.68s)]
*  right they can't let go they can't let go and they know if they're like addicts they know that the fix that they're getting is destroying them is killing them and they know every time they put that person like that on they lose market share they lose money they've settled these defamation suits but they they have people still working for them that think I'm going to put these people on makes me feel good I get high on it and I know it's going to end nowhere but to bankruptcy and destroy it but I can't stop [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1510.68s)]
*  and that's what MSNBC and CNN Los Angeles Times are all the same and they can't stop and so it's there's there's another example I want to show you okay while we're on the subject of CNN I could be doing this all day on MSNBC to but CNN at least is trying to claim that they're more fair and balanced which is not true yeah they're really not letting go of the race thing they've got this show on hosted by Abby Philip who is as woke as they come on every issue she thinks she's down [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1540.68s)]
*  trodden poor her because she's a black woman and therefore we're supposed to be feeling sorry for her she made that very clear in a segment the other night but she makes it clear in pretty much all of her segments so this is a segment in which she had on two black women as guests she is a black woman and two white men as well along with one white woman and the two white men are names that our guests are our audience probably knows Scott Jennings who's the only fair guy over there and CNN and Republican and our pal Arthur [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1570.68s)]
*  Idallah who's a lawyer I mean he doesn't often do political commentary but he's doing some over him on CNN he got completely ambushed as these I mean honestly all these women are extremely successful you would have thought that it was 1949 America the way this thing went down watch this [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1600.68s)]
*  we live in different realities that's right I live in a reality where I know I do not have the same opportunity as you I know I don't and you know I know what's going on [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1619.36s)]
*  I'm gonna get a lot agree a master's and two bachelor's probably more education that all y'all added up together at this table and I have always been the least paid person on payroll at every institution I have worked in and it's not because the White House well whose fault is that I don't think he worked for George W. Trump Obama's DI but I think you made it and you are the most respected voice often at every room or every table [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1633.4s)]
*  you're in not because of any reading thing other than your talent and your work ethic I have faced this I just said I was the least paid person even in this moment sometimes to my counterparts I do believe I'm qualified I know I'm qualified you won't ever tell me I'm not qualified but the system that I live in doesn't matter about my qualification [[00:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1663.4s)]
*  I am the Attorney General is a black woman the mayor is a black man the head of the Senate is a black woman New York is a small representation but the numbers also show black women are one of the most educated demographics in this country and one of the least paid why would that make any sense [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1686.4s)]
*  why would that make any sense it's incredibly frustrating to watch that kind of thing Victor I mean I guarantee Abby Phillip was out there just as bad as the other two I guarantee you she's making over a million dollars and yet she's still like Michelle Obama wants us to think this is a racist sexist country that won't reward her adequately for her talents and then you got this other girl over there her name is Carrie Champion no sorry [[00:28:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1702.4s)]
*  I was Ashley Allison Abby Phillip and Carrie Champion all three of them were giving them the hard the business and she's going I I don't have the same opportunity I've been the least paid in all my jobs how do you know that's due to your color and your gender right maybe you were the youngest maybe you had the least experience maybe you didn't and you actually just weren't that talented I've seen you on TV you're fine you're not a star you're never going to get your own show there's a reason they haven't offered it to you yet it's not because you're a black woman because you're on the show of a black woman clearly CNN does never problem with that [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1732.4s)]
*  maybe you're just not that talented maybe you're not quite as good on television or in the White House for Obama who I don't think has a bias against black women as you think you are but this is their chance to get out there even though the nation has just issued a referendum on the nonsense around this kind of thinking to say you're all wrong we're victims [[00:29:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1762.32s)]
*  yeah well all these things again I go back to reality not what they say but what they do I've been in academia 50 years I probably chaired 20 maybe maybe 40 search committees and not one case did I ever have a problem with getting a qualified black Hispanic and mostly female into graduate school law school or medical schools [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1784.16s)]
*  undergrad if I had a white male I figured that he had to have 40 to 100 points at least higher in the SAT perfect and I still couldn't get them in and I must have had a hundred calls in my life when I would complain from these Ivy League schools that say we do not want any more white males that's just a fact and when you apply for college Megan there is no instance of any African American or Hispanic who is applying for college [[00:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1807.56s)]
*  who says no no I'm going to lie and say I'm white so I can get advantage there is a whole pathology of people who are white claiming like Elizabeth Warren that they're 1 16th 1 10th Native American Hispanic that was my biggest problem I get calls and the people say Victor this person says he's 1 8th black he's 1 15th Cherokee can you verify that and so why would people do that if what she said is true and the fact is for the last 40 years [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1837.56s)]
*  being a person of color is an advantage and what's getting people very angry is that when Barack Obama came in he got rid of the old binary affirmative action black 12% white 88% special consideration because of slavery Jim Crowe income disparity he said no no no no it's now going to be diversity and we're going to define that as anybody who's not white and all of a sudden people from India from China and it was like you're a white person and you're [[00:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1867.56s)]
*  all of a sudden you see somebody coming from the Punjab who makes 150,000 dollars he's a minority or she's this and then the white working class finally rebelled against it they said you know what this has nothing to do with oppression there's no history of racism or culpability in many of these groups they have a higher per capita income than whites do 16 different ethnic groups do and yet they're getting this diversity equity inclusion and that's what broke the back of it it was it was completely [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1897.56s)]
*  absurd people were willing to say because of the historic racism toward blacks they were willing to support affirmative action for a while but after 50 years they said at some point when do we stop violating the constitution by having racial preferences but they never supported diversity equity inclusion because it was a complete fraud and the other thing about it is the old rainbow coalition of Jesse Jackson intersectionality [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1927.56s)]
*  we're going to make this great non-white complex of hispanics native americans blacks trans there was no evidence ever that any of these groups have more affinity with each other than they did for what whites many of them just identified as people and [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1957.56s)]
*  he those she should ask herself why 48% of the hispanic vote went for trump in here you know and hispanic males were 54% so-called people of color intersectionality what happened they voted against a black woman [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1974.8s)]
*  and they are people of color she should ask why that is and the answer was they said we're no longer going to identify as a essentially a particular race it's going to be incidental we're more worried about human concerns like inflation or energy prices or crime [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=1993.26s)]
*  and that's what's frightening because they can't get off that fixation and she knows the more she talks like she did on the air the more she turns off not white males alone but hispanic everybody and she can't stop she's so used to being given deference she cannot stop same thing with the view if you just change it around like you said you flipped it over and a white person was talking about blacks and collective stereotypes [[00:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2009.52s)]
*  you'd have a i don't know they'd be they'd be off the air in a nanosecond oh yeah oh look what happened so this jasmine crocket she's a representative out of the state of texas she went on tv the other night this is cnn2 and she was responding to the fact that the trump administration hired in some lower level capacity a guy who had sent out some racially charged tweets about how if you really want things done you should hire white men they were not good tweets [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2036.48s)]
*  so okay fine she can criticize this guy but listen to the language in which she does it and you ask me whether anybody could get away with doing this exchange the races a white person talking this way about black commentators here it is now it doesn't change my opinion because we saw what he literally recently just posted and the coddling is for the white boys that's what's happening right now i am tired of the white tears listen if you are competent you are not [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2065.44s)]
*  concerned when i walk into congress every single day you know why i don't feel away and why you can't make me doubt who i am is because i know that i had to work ten times as hard as they did just to get into the seat when you look and you compare me to marjorie taylor green or me to lauren bobert there is no comparison and that is the life that we have always lived so the only people that are crying are the mediocre white boys that have been beaten out by people that historically have had to work so so much harder they don't want any [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2095.44s)]
*  more kamala harris's they don't want any more jasmine crockett's but i got news for them i don't care what they do we will fight to the end to make sure that we get our due because again if you want to talk about the people that shouldn't be in this country you probably need to look in the mirror because the last time i checked the native americans who summer ice have been rounding up or the puerto rican's who are absolutely americans listen the only people that came and colonized this place are your ancestors trump. [[00:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2125.44s)]
*  Okay just to just to reiterate so picture this picture a white person sitting there saying coddling is for the black boys i'm sick and tired of the black tears i had to work ten times harder than any of the black people i'm sick of these mediocre black boys it's obviously offensive it's racist it's incredibly racially charged she's so deeply offensive. [[00:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2155.44s)]
*  Total pass you can talk like that no problem on cnn because you're ripping on whites and white men in particular and because they teed it up with one guy's racist tweets so you can just go off and be as equally or more racist as you want. [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2180.32s)]
*  Why but the thing she doesn't understand is if you look at asians they went from about 30% for trump in 2020 to almost 45% hispanic as i said they were 48% they went up 15 points hispanic males went up 20 points according to her idea of intersectionality why would a person that she would consider and she mentioned native american but native american vote went for trump that was really shocking but what's the point. [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2199.04s)]
*  Why would all of these groups that are so called non-white vote for a white male other than a black woman. [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2229.04s)]
*  Well you know what they say they say that the hispanics are white adjacent or those are black people who want to be white adjacent and sort of be near the circle. [[00:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2236.96s)]
*  Why i live i live here in the san joaquin valley and this is not the first diaspora from northern mexico where people came in the 1950s and 60s who were they were indistinguishable from italian say these these are people coming up that are indigenous and they're from wahaka chiapas michoacan. [[00:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2246.96s)]
*  And they are distinctly identifiable as indigenous people and that is the new influx of the last 30 years that is the demographic not the so-called northern mexicans of 50 years ago who were more or less the the bulwark of the democratic party. [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2266.88s)]
*  The people who are voting republican are first generation mexican american males from the deepest part of mexico the most impoverished some people spanish is their second language they speak an indigenous indigenous mixotec. [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2285.84s)]
*  Why would they vote for donald trump over a black woman nobody forced him to do that it's not marx's false consciousness or what's what's wrong with kansas and all that crap the intellectuals try to say they do it because they're sick and tired of someone talking nonstop like. [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2302.32s)]
*  Representative crocket about race and they think that people who deliver the goods cheaper gas cheaper energy more jobs safer streaks. [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2320.64s)]
*  They want to live in a world like that that's why they left mexico not to recreate mexico and so she she's got she has no support and i think the longer that she talks like that. [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2331.0s)]
*  And the longer the people in the view do and the longer representative warren i mean senator warren or her ono screaming yell or corey booker keeps yelling and screaming it's going to it's going to drive down. [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2343.0s)]
*  The democratic party into nothing they should go back megan and look at the 92 and 96 democratic convention statements they were written by doug showen and mark ben i could not believe them i went back and looked at not and. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2357.24s)]
*  After being in the wilderness for 12 years with reagan and bush one. [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2369.96s)]
*  Even with ross perot they won the election and you look at it says we the democratic party are for tough crime no exemptions given to youth we want to balance the budget we want to close the border legal only immigration that's what they talked about and they want. [[00:39:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2375.52s)]
*  And they've never and then and obama mouth that for one four years and then he went full jacob and just like these people and they're not going to win and she's. [[00:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2390.8s)]
*  The militant black or any militant that that puts race is the essential characteristic of somebody in a multiracial society postmodern way they're not going to win people are sick of it. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2402.0s)]
*  Look at the military they have their having record they're getting almost 10,000 recruits in december and january they're going to meet their goal for the first time the pentagon's not going to have to live for the last three years are short 4050 and they say. [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2416.0s)]
*  Well kind of sorta we really didn't have that goal so they lower the goal we met it but now. [[00:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2430.08s)]
*  There's people rejoining because they think it's going to be less race obsessed and less di and more merit credit it's a really it's kind of a renaissance and she's on the losing end and. [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2435.08s)]
*  I expect them to get small that group cadre to get smaller and smaller and louder and louder and meaner and more more racist and I think because they're losing and they're going to be completely impotent if they continue. [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2447.16s)]
*  The numbers with the with the military are amazing Pete hexeth tweeted this out the other day in december the US army had its best recruiting number in 12 years obviously this is post trump's election in january. [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2461.0s)]
*  2025 the army hit its best recruiting number in 15 years bottom line america's youth want to serve under the bold and strong america first leadership of real at at real donald trump of donald trump and Pete hexeth to who getting who's getting all the wokeness out of the military. [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2474.2s)]
*  I just wanted to. [[00:41:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2491.0s)]
*  Make a couple points on this so the in that debate the annoying debate with the three women against arthur and scott jennings one of them. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2492.6s)]
*  You know she's asking for like what you know where all the black women and an arthur who's a lawyer says look at the supreme court. [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2504.12s)]
*  Look at the supreme court and on the supreme court we have a black woman katanji brown jackson and we have a black man clarence thomas and we have four women by the way we have four women on their three lives and. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2510.28s)]
*  Amy coney barrett and so he says look at the supreme court and they say but how many and he says I mean there's two black people on the supreme court two out of nine. [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  Which is greater than the population level and they say but how many and he says well there's a there's a one black woman and there's a black man too and he said well look at the population percentage right black women are 6% of the population. [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2531.32s)]
*  But I don't know what's what's one out of nine it's less it's more than 10% and so he says you know look at the pot and they say. [[00:42:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2547.32s)]
*  When they say don't don't go to numbers why are you stop doing numbers me what they they brought up numbers they say how many are on there he's like well look what's the population number they said well don't bring up numbers. [[00:42:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2556.84s)]
*  So like they don't want to go there right it's like wait you're so oppressed black women can't get anywhere in America and you know just because they're black and they're women. [[00:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2567.44s)]
*  No did anybody mention Kamala Harris like the Democrats just had a black female presidential nominee they had a black president. [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2576.72s)]
*  But that's not they had a black female vice president in the last term like none of that counts you see the numbers are never good enough even when they're greater. [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2588.28s)]
*  Then the population share there's always something you can say if it's not parity if it's not 5050 even though that's not what the population is there's something wrong with America. [[00:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2597.32s)]
*  There is I mean does anybody want to say let's not make let's get rid of merit and we're going to have 15% of the Super Bowl teams are going to be Asian. [[00:43:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2607.56s)]
*  And we're going to insist on 20% are Hispanic and they have to have 68% white and the NFL and the NBA yeah and women NFL and the NBA range from 65 to 70% African American. [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2617.32s)]
*  Same thing with the federal works a postal services about 28% black and so whenever you get to those numbers and here I work at Stanford University. [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2631.6400000000003s)]
*  For the last four years they let in 9% white males white males constitute about 33% of the population. [[00:44:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2641.92s)]
*  And they wave the SAT and all of a sudden now Megan they say oh wait a minute. [[00:44:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2650.1600000000003s)]
*  We're going to go back and have an essay T from now on oh wait a minute we're going to start comparatively ranking your GPA on the quality of your high school again oh wait a minute. [[00:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=2655.96s)]

*  Than it is to her what happens to my kid or somebody else's kid listening to this show and all of us have risen up and elected Donald Trump who has told her she can pound sand we care more about these girls safety than we do about Megan Rapinoe and Sue Bird her fiance feeling good about themselves as virtuous people those days are passed we know they're not alright VDH stays with us don't go away.

*  So Victor this week we finally saw the transcript from CBS News of that infamous Kamala Harris sit down right before the election they were forced to turn it over to the FCC after a complaint was filed by team Trump about possible deception. [[00:50:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3051.56s)]
*  In in advertising and in dealing with the public and what we saw was that terrible answer that she gave to Netanyahu is not listening which had one answer on 60 minutes and a different answer in the teaser clip that aired on face the nation. [[00:51:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3069.36s)]
*  Got no better behind the scenes was really just those two answers melded together that's all that was there but was more interesting was some of the stuff they omitted they cut from the interview and nobody's obligated to air the whole interview it doesn't always happen that year the 60 never airs the whole interview. [[00:51:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3086.72s)]
*  But it was very interesting what they chose to cut out including in an ID like this. [[00:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3103.04s)]
*  Ambition and aspirations and dreams and optimism and hope if you look at the character of who we are and how we have achieved the strength that we have achieved. [[00:51:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3109.28s)]
*  I believe in large part it is because of our character and our belief in the promise of America. [[00:52:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3125.36s)]
*  And I'm running for president because I want to do everything that is possible to create an opportunity for people to achieve those goals those ambitions and those dreams. [[00:52:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3130.96s)]
*  Now there is reporting today that CBS staffers are reportedly becoming increasingly upset about the drama unfolding over at 60 minutes that puck news reporting about the mixed emotions from staffers following comments made by 60 minutes executive producer Bill Owens who told his colleagues at Monday's meeting that the editing was quite a bit of a shock to the audience. [[00:52:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3143.76s)]
*  Is the edit fine? [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3169.36s)]
*  One CBS News insider asked rhetorically it's obviously an unforced error and now they are upset at the possibility of CBS News settling the 10 billion dollar lawsuit that Trump filed against them down in Texas alleging fraud in their editing. [[00:52:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3170.36s)]
*  And this is something that we expect they are going to settle because their parent company Paramount is trying to get a merger approved by the Trump administration and CBS News as you know the vaunted journalists there don't want to pay him one dime and even internally though are questioning whether they did the right thing in that ridiculous interview they aired. [[00:53:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3190.96s)]
*  Yeah I think Corinne Jean-Pierre would call that a cheap fake when the edited version because they don't even make an argument anymore they used to say that she was Socrates or Cicero or something but you know James Carville the other day said we lost because we had the seventh string as our candidate and then when she gave a talk I don't know if you saw that clip of her talking about the [[00:53:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3212.56s)]
*  It was even worse so I guess when she talks like this even her own supporters will say they cringe and they'll say we've got to edit this or we've got to keep her off the stage and the question is how did she ever get where she was getting back to representative Crocker's you know I mean she's she had everything entitled from her from the very beginning and from the very beginning she had one card and you saw that in her video and she was like oh my gosh I'm going to get a lot of money from that. [[00:53:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3238.08s)]

*  Bianca sensory, okay [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3474.24s)]
*  Bear with me. I'm gonna tie it together [[00:57:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3476.92s)]

*  She's wearing a tuxedo [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3486.0s)]

*  The choice to wear a tuxedo as opposed to a blazer or blouse made Trump look more like a freelance magician [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3515.68s)]
*  Than a public servant. It's perhaps unsurprising that a woman who lived in a gold encrusted penthouse [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3521.7599999999998s)]

*  This is the woman who thinks she's in the position to judge Melania [[00:59:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3583.58s)]
*  She says she when she was offered her job as a fashion writer at vogue a year and a half ago [[00:59:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3587.4s)]
*  She was a part-time dance teacher who had just emptied her savings to move across the country [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3591.44s)]
*  This was done. Nothing. Do you hate Melania? You're hired. You're the one for us. Okay. I'm almost done now contrast that [[00:59:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3596.2000000000003s)]
*  It's not the same writer but the same magazine to what they wrote about [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3604.5200000000004s)]
*  Bianca sensory the literally naked [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3609.0s)]
*  Wife of Kanye West yay West at the Grammys. She literally wore nothing and [[01:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3613.2s)]
*  They were there for it. This writer is named Raven Smith and [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3620.56s)]
*  She writes all about how somehow this was [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3626.32s)]
*  Empowering she describes it as a slip so sheer so without undergarments that it exposed her uncensored nudity beneath [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3630.68s)]
*  So a slip. Okay, she writes [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3638.06s)]
*  About how look fashion for me has always celebrated a body's sensuality [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3641.3799999999997s)]
*  Rather than the unimaginative base level provocation of a woman's nakedness [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3647.1s)]
*  But she goes on to say while I'm not necessarily [[01:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3652.3799999999997s)]
*  Advocating for snatch on the red carpet. It could also be argued that it's Bianca's body and therefore Bianca's choice [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3655.3799999999997s)]
*  I hate to state the obvious but a woman can wear whatever she wants a woman can wear as many sheer body suits and thongs as [[01:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3661.8199999999997s)]
*  She likes a woman can court the male gaze a woman can make a zillion choices [[01:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3669.26s)]
*  We wouldn't personally make ourselves and still not have that means she's being coerced or a victim or that something predatory has happened [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3673.2200000000003s)]
*  And then she writes that [[01:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3680.38s)]
*  Because Bianca's not speaking up because we're bereft of any deeper motivations [[01:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3683.26s)]
*  The silence has a scrabbling for answers of her own. But maybe that's exactly what Bianca wanted [[01:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3687.0600000000004s)]
*  You see that that was empowering but Melania Trump is a pathetic [[01:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3694.02s)]
*  magician [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3700.7400000000002s)]
*  Who is performing? [[01:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3702.06s)]
*  theatrics and is [[01:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3704.46s)]
*  situationally [[01:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3706.58s)]
*  Inappropriate but Bianca is totally appropriate and a badass girl boss [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3707.7000000000003s)]
*  You know that I think everybody understands that Melania is the most photogenic [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3714.2200000000003s)]
*  fashion [[01:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3720.86s)]
*  Conscious but also in a very positive way since Jackie Kennedy [[01:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3722.1s)]
*  We've never seen you the last time we had it fair or not the last time we had anybody that glamorous attractive [[01:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3725.38s)]
*  Knowing about fashion good taste was Jackie Kennedy and every and they went crazy over Jackie Kennedy [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3733.94s)]
*  I can remember as I was a kid [[01:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3739.2s)]
*  Every magazine had Jackie Kennedy Jackie did this Jackie wore this and she actually dressed a lot like Melania and then [[01:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3741.66s)]
*  When they talk about the body it was just five years ago Megan we heard about objectifying women [[01:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3749.3s)]
*  During the me2 thing that you don't objectify a woman by just gazing at her body [[01:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3755.58s)]
*  Are you you you don't do that you male predators? [[01:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3760.1400000000003s)]
*  and so the problem with all of this is that that writer can't decide whether [[01:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3763.38s)]
*  feminism is a Victorian prudery that you look at a woman or you touch her shoulder and that is a [[01:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3770.2200000000003s)]
*  You know a mortal sin and you're gonna destroy your career or you can get naked and [[01:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3776.9s)]
*  You can be more provocatively sexually than any time in the history of America the way young girls dress today [[01:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3781.94s)]
*  You know that better than I do everybody knows that they're the most provocative dress [[01:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3788.26s)]
*  They're being encouraged to dress like that at the same time the feminist movement was saying to men if you dare look at that [[01:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3792.3s)]
*  And they want you to and this writer is saying that the now she wants the male gaze [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3800.9s)]
*  But if she actually got the male gaze [[01:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3805.5s)]
*  Then that person could be he would be canceled like me for the woman to want it [[01:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3807.9s)]
*  But it's not okay for the men to do it [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3813.0200000000004s)]
*  Yes, and that's what that's what destroyed me too [[01:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3815.7000000000003s)]
*  And that's what's destroying the whole that all these internal contradictions because they're they're all contrary to human nature [[01:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3819.1400000000003s)]
*  We have rules and laws against people walking around naked for a very good reason [[01:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3825.3s)]
*  Because we don't want people to provoke people sexually and we don't want to [[01:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3830.26s)]
*  See people's private parts and public no one wants to see that and that's why for centuries [[01:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3836.34s)]
*  there's been laws against nudity and [[01:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3842.1000000000004s)]
*  All the as [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3845.82s)]
*  Revolutionaries they think they can break these ancient customs and traditions that were never based [[01:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3847.9s)]
*  They think on anything other than oppression when they were all based on human nature and we inherited all of this this [[01:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3852.0s)]
*  Tradition and it's served us very well and [[01:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3859.38s)]
*  You know the final thing I say about you know when we're getting back to Elon Musk [[01:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3863.38s)]
*  I have never thought I was thinking that when you we were talking about [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3867.46s)]
*  The hatred of Elon Musk we have never seen anybody whether you like him or not [[01:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3872.26s)]
*  We have never seen anybody like him in our lifetime that broke into the big three auto industry [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3876.3s)]
*  I know one is there they've tried to do that Studebaker American Motor. Nobody could do it. He did it [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3881.6600000000003s)]
*  Nobody has surplanted NASA like he did. He's a one-man NASA. He saved NASA [[01:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3887.86s)]
*  He's probably going to save these poor astronauts that were [[01:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3893.26s)]
*  Abandoned by the Biden space program and then he just revolutionized social media had he not bought bought X [[01:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3896.7000000000003s)]
*  I don't think Mark Zuckerberg Jeff Bezos all those tech giants would have defected to Trump [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3903.46s)]
*  They would have censored the news. They would have had the FBI. He is he's he isn't Michael Angelo [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3909.02s)]
*  He's really a Renaissance person and for them that I say that because AOC said I think yesterday that of all the billionaires [[01:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3915.18s)]
*  She met he was the dumbest or he was very intelligent. Yes. She did [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3922.66s)]
*  things she said [[01:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3927.74s)]
*  Yeah, absolutely so yeah, no it's shocking I mean her her cluelessness and I mean the emptiness of her insults [[01:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3931.58s)]
*  Okay, while we're on the subject of salaciousness [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3939.06s)]
*  I am happy to tell you it's back in Super Bowl ads and I think America is just [[01:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3941.98s)]
*  Fine with that now. I do think it's interesting you get a preview. You know, the big game is this Sunday [[01:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3949.1000000000004s)]
*  it's gonna be Chiefs vs. Eagles and [[01:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3953.94s)]
*  These things can be a bit of a cultural touchstone right like just where are we as a nation? [[01:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3957.5400000000004s)]
*  They are removing from the end zone the end racism signs [[01:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3963.1000000000004s)]
*  That's big right because we've been subjected to those lectures from the NFL for four going on five years now [[01:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3968.16s)]
*  They are not eliminating the so-called black national anthem we're gonna have that thing which is divisive in this context [[01:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3976.56s)]
*  Yes, it is, but there's they're doing it [[01:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3984.08s)]
*  We are going to get a halftime interview of President Trump unlike Joe Biden who wouldn't sit for one because he couldn't [[01:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3988.2s)]
*  Trump has weighed in on the Super Bowl where he will be attending and [[01:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=3996.0s)]
*  Let me see if I can find what he said. He posted two great quarterbacks in this game [[01:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4000.72s)]
*  Also an unbelievable running back and the absolute best tight end in football now [[01:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4005.4s)]
*  We think that's a reference to Saquon Barkley on the Eagles and Travis Kelsey on the Chiefs [[01:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4010.06s)]
*  Incredible coaching if they would only get rid of that really weird looking new kickoff deal, which actually makes football more dangerous [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4015.64s)]
*  There's some new kickoff and at the NFL they would be doing everybody especially the fans a big favor [[01:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4022.04s)]
*  Anyway, it will be a great game. I'll be doing the interview before the game at 3 p.m [[01:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4027.16s)]
*  There hasn't been one in four years. Gee. I wonder why okay, so that's Trump and [[01:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4031.36s)]
*  Then you tell me you know like all over Twitter the past two weeks [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4037.08s)]
*  Anything that happens you see like a Trump thing or Trump dance or you know girls [[01:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4040.88s)]
*  Celebrating Trump and you see the line. We are so back. We are so back [[01:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4046.04s)]

*  Yeah, so and you know, it kind of reminds me during the Reagan years. You remember the [[01:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4121.76s)]
*  1984 you're too young maybe but [[01:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4128.0199999999995s)]
*  They had that great scene where the woman runs in with the ball and she throws it into the screen [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4130.179999999999s)]
*  It's Orwell's screen and that's supposed to be a competition for Apple Apple was coming in nobody [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4135.4s)]
*  Everybody said IBM or Microsoft would crush Apple and this woman runs into this or welly and a crowd [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4141.24s)]

*  It was very famous and it was the I it was kind of an epitome of the age that Reagan was [[01:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4152.9s)]
*  Kind of that whole period of 84 to 85 86 [[01:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4157.44s)]
*  It was like we don't have to do any of that stuff anymore [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4162.0s)]
*  And that was a very liberating period when he came in he just and he hasn't done with all due respect to his memory and legacy [[01:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4164.84s)]
*  Which was wonderful. He hasn't done he I don't think he's he did as much in [[01:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4172.16s)]
*  Eight years as Donald Trump has done in four years and one month. I really don't especially the last one month [[01:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4177.96s)]
*  The last it's not even a no. It's not even a month yet. It seems like a year [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4185.04s)]

*  everybody like to it like I feel like there is something significant to the fact that [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4196.08s)]
*  The the obvious nature of men and women is back on screen and being celebrated that women love to be sexy [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4201.719999999999s)]
*  We're appropriate and in a Carl's Jr. Ad [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4209.32s)]
*  It's totally appropriate and men love to fawn over them and that's a dynamic that actually leads to the continuation of humankind [[01:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4211.679999999999s)]
*  And it's fine, but we went through this crazy period it's no accident that it's been eight years, right eight years ago [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=4218.08s)]

*  Yes, and he's like every beat though in that line. It's like he's a multiple entrepreneur. He's a teen genius [[01:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5216.54s)]

*  Make me regret it, but if he does I'll probably forgive him. I'll forgive they're making it sound like Elon is in there with his team [[01:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5246.02s)]
*  Of you know six gunslingers looking up our Social Security numbers [[01:27:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5253.42s)]
*  So he can open up a credit card in our in our name, right? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5256.86s)]
*  Like this is there's some nefarious purpose. He has competitors. He could be spying on their data [[01:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5259.52s)]
*  It's like meanwhile what Elon has wanted to do [[01:27:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5264.42s)]
*  He's made very clear what he what he wants to do [[01:27:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5267.38s)]
*  Which is find efficiencies in each of these agencies and they're overstating the extent of his access [[01:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5269.46s)]
*  Like for example, they wanted us to believe that these these hackers had access to change [[01:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5275.64s)]
*  Code or change data at Treasury but Scott percent came out here and said that is not true [[01:28:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5281.4s)]
*  Here he is in part and sought 33 in an interview with Bloomberg [[01:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5287.32s)]
*  First of all, when you say the Doge team, these are Treasury employees [[01:28:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5291.04s)]
*  Two Treasury employees one of whom I personally interviewed in his final round [[01:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5295.84s)]
*  There is no tinkering with the system. They are on read-only [[01:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5300.92s)]
*  They are looking they can make no changes [[01:28:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5306.4400000000005s)]
*  It is an operational program to suggest improvement the ability to change the system sits over at the Federal Reserve [[01:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5309.52s)]
*  So it doesn't even lie in this building so they could make suggestions on how to change the system [[01:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5316.92s)]
*  But we don't even run the system [[01:28:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5324.4s)]
*  Okay, so what who are we to believe wired that they're having access and they can actually change code or [[01:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5327.52s)]
*  Scott the center says they can only read it [[01:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5332.88s)]
*  Yeah, I mean I think that the wires just and all the media [[01:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5334.88s)]
*  They're gonna say whatever they have to say to make this seem more terrifying than it is [[01:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5337.4400000000005s)]
*  Because if you just break it down into its basics [[01:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5341.360000000001s)]
*  You have the duly elected president of the United States has hired a person to do a job that the American people knew about before [[01:29:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5343.68s)]
*  He was hired and now he's doing it and we're glad and there's no doubt [[01:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5350.320000000001s)]
*  And there's just like not a lot of ways you can make that sound scary. So I mean it's like again [[01:29:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5356.0s)]
*  It's like I know I know what I think I know what they're gonna think [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5360.76s)]
*  I think they're kind of gonna stay in their little corner and keep making stories or whatever [[01:29:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5363.320000000001s)]
*  But yeah, I mean I want to see these people I want to see the bureaucratic state [[01:29:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5366.96s)]
*  Slimmed yeah, and and I'm enjoying this I know and who would you hire to actually go through code and go through efficiently young [[01:29:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5372.56s)]
*  Energetic men who understand how to code Elon sense some tweet out the other day saying it's so great [[01:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5379.64s)]
*  How my opponents all these bureaucrats take the weekends off, right? [[01:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5386.12s)]
*  He's like it's like playing an opponent who leaves the field for two days. They don't know what they're dealing with, right? [[01:29:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5389.84s)]
*  The man is tireless. He moved a cot into one of these government buildings and they're all sleeping there [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5395.08s)]
*  I mean, I think they do know what they're dealing with which would account for [[01:29:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5399.92s)]
*  How much they focused on Elon from the moment that he started working with Trump? [[01:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5403.5599999999995s)]
*  It was I think really scared to them. I think they do know that he's a very powerful person. He is relentless [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5407.8s)]
*  he just will work and work and work and [[01:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5414.0s)]
*  And also he just did this he just ran this game back over at Twitter [[01:30:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5416.56s)]
*  And we saw the exact same reaction from the media then also hiding behind the lie that it was gonna collapse [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5420.68s)]
*  It was like oh [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5425.64s)]
*  Imminent imminent Twitter will shut down [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5427.360000000001s)]
*  It will be it will just sort of like burn to the ground and of course [[01:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5429.320000000001s)]
*  They never really believed that what they were most afraid of was not Twitter collapsing but Twitter surviving under new leadership that didn't censor [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5432.78s)]
*  And I think that's what you're seeing now [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5440.0199999999995s)]
*  In the government, it's a fear here is a walk down that memory lane media and Dems [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5442.0199999999995s)]
*  But again the same thing on Elon's Twitter experiment when he found efficiencies of their mosque has turned X formally known as Twitter into a [[01:30:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5446.2s)]
*  cesspool of [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5454.38s)]
*  hate speech and [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5455.98s)]
*  Extremist incitement, it's a shithole right you Elon fuck that shit up. There's better engagement on threads Instagram [[01:30:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5458.139999999999s)]
*  There's a really terrific product and Twitter [[01:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5464.179999999999s)]
*  It's awful. I know sawed me when I see it because Elon Musk is I mean he's the worst these [[01:31:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5467.98s)]
*  Is that why he's often compared to a bond villain the guys the guys a joke, right? [[01:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5473.339999999999s)]
*  He really is a joke now Musk is just one of the dangerously weird and extreme cranks astonished at how dumb [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5477.339999999999s)]
*  Elon Musk and he is as crazy as he seems on Twitter this dude tripped over his dick and became successful. I [[01:31:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5483.86s)]
*  Mean again, it's like they're just terrified. They Twitter was crazy because I mean I wrote about that a lot at the time [[01:31:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5495.34s)]
*  Everybody understood that Twitter was controlling the discourse in the country. All the journalists lived there the censorship was the the [[01:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5502.66s)]
*  Politics were completely constricted around this one narrow opinion [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5510.740000000001s)]
*  They were also amplifying content on the sort of Twitter. What was it back then? It was the trending topics [[01:31:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5514.18s)]
*  So you had both censorship and propaganda pushing pushing a narrative and everybody kind of understood immediately [[01:31:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5519.620000000001s)]
*  That once Elon took over that was going to be gutted and we would actually have something like free speech now [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5526.900000000001s)]
*  There are bad things about that like or not bad things about that [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5533.02s)]
*  But there are nasty things that happen in an environment of freedom [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5536.5s)]
*  But also the truth and and that's very I was terrifying to people like, you know, the MSNBC talking heads yesterday [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5539.7s)]
*  We ran a soundbite from Harry Enton on CNN showing how the numbers jacked up in support of a ban on boys [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5545.62s)]
*  Participating in girls sports just in the past couple of years, you know [[01:32:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5552.66s)]
*  It was like 63% and now it's 79% just in the past couple of years and I attribute that to Elon Musk's purchase of Twitter [[01:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5555.54s)]
*  Because he [[01:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5563.82s)]
*  Completely took off the caps on what we could say about that the conversation completely changed people could say what was real [[01:32:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5565.34s)]
*  You were not allowed to say that men cannot become women when Jack Dorsey had it when the previous ownership had it and [[01:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5571.02s)]
*  Once you say the truth people know it in their bones. It's [[01:32:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5577.9400000000005s)]
*  Liberating he completely changed the national conversation on it. Yeah, I agree. I think that the average person probably doesn't [[01:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5581.3s)]
*  Think much about these ideas and they're just kind of looking around for a sense of what is acceptable to say in society [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5587.46s)]
*  And they maybe have this opinion themselves, but they're not going to share it if it seems artificially like everybody agrees that [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5593.46s)]
*  Boys should be fighting girls in combat sports or something. You're like man, that sounds crazy, but I'm not gonna get involved the moment [[01:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5600.9800000000005s)]
*  As you mentioned, yeah the moment people are allowed to express themselves [[01:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5607.46s)]
*  Actually, you get a different sense for where the bounds of culture actually exist. Yeah, he didn't have to push it [[01:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5610.46s)]
*  He just had to take the cap off. Yes, and people would say how they felt which is so interesting because people say that he's pushing a narrative on Twitter [[01:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5615.46s)]
*  But that's not true. He's just not it's the absence of a narrative now. I do think there's been some [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5621.46s)]
*  Changing of the culture there as things like blue sky open up and threads and there are just these people who really can't be around other people [[01:33:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5627.46s)]
*  Who disagree with them? Yeah, and they have found those places where they're you know, constantly screaming and crying blue sky is especially interesting [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5633.46s)]
*  Because it's a place where words are considered violence, but you can also call for violence [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5639.46s)]
*  Against people who are bad. It's a strange place. All they do is keep censoring each other and reporting each other [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5643.46s)]
*  This is this tweet has been censored. This post has been censored for insensitivity [[01:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5647.46s)]
*  Unless you're calling for the death of a Republican or right on it and then you're good. But especially yeah, that's the green light [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5651.46s)]
*  So we you weren't here yet, but we open the show today talking about you and your piece about how you argued [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5656.46s)]
*  Okay, he trumped with his Eos on gender and his Eos on DEI and the lot the leak and Riley act and his Eos on the border [[01:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5661.46s)]
*  And they don't like any of that and you can see the media is not as much of a fan of the show [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5668.46s)]
*  And you can see the media still holding on like no everyone's racist. No men can be women [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5672.46s)]
*  But the thing that really got them out in the streets was the cutback of federal bureaucrats jobs [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5677.46s)]
*  Including today at the DOE. They're very upset about USAID [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5684.46s)]
*  Now magazines like Politico are seeing their their subscriptions from these federal government offices, you know pulled because the government doesn't want to pay [[01:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5687.46s)]
*  Taxpayer dollars for these things now. They're pissed. Yeah, we're surprised [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5695.46s)]
*  I would love I would love to say that I wasn't that I wasn't surprised that I saw it coming [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5699.46s)]
*  But I really was surprised I expected much more on the stuff that you just mentioned even the gender stuff, especially the immigration stuff [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5704.46s)]
*  But it is it's it's the firing of the federal workers and I think that they're correct [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5710.46s)]
*  I think that what they're realizing or what I'm realizing is that Elon and Trump or Trump through Elon is now over the actual target [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5716.46s)]
*  Which is I mean, I think we had this idea that the deep state which is the scary kind of conspiracy theory sounding thing was like the smoking man from the X-Files [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5723.46s)]
*  Like this guy in the shadows was really competent and pulling the strings [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5731.46s)]
*  But it actually is like this genderqueer librarian who works in the federal government and there are thousands of them and they just best case scenario [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5734.46s)]
*  It's a jobs program and they don't do much of anything but worst case scenario [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5742.46s)]
*  There's a small minority who are totally radical and they're opposed to any time a Republican gets in office [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5745.46s)]
*  They're opposed to everything they do and they get in the way and they muck up the gears and you wonder like we voted them in to do these things [[01:35:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5750.46s)]
*  Why aren't they doing anything? And it's because of this it's because we actually I think we do have a deep state [[01:35:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5756.46s)]
*  It's like what I mean by that is an unelected class of bureaucrats who are controlling the government and and now we're being told that dismantling that is akin to anti democracy [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5761.46s)]
*  And it's like actually President Trump was elected and this is what he was elected for and you're standing on the side of what the State Department has been doing [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5771.46s)]
*  Did you see that where they pulled up that upside down American flag outside of the State Department? [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5779.46s)]
*  And you mean to tell me that like the QAnon shaman with his spiky little hat is somehow more dangerous than that [[01:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5784.46s)]
*  That's much more frightening to me and I think that everybody on the on the left really does have an intuitive sense of this [[01:36:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5789.46s)]
*  Even the center left even the more reasonable people I think that they felt comfortable knowing that a Republican couldn't actually do much given this thing that's in place [[01:36:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5797.46s)]
*  And I've in my life never seen a Republican go after it like this even Trump didn't go after it like this round one [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5805.46s)]
*  He didn't understand it. I don't think he did. I mean I didn't understand no one maybe fully understood it [[01:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5813.46s)]
*  And yeah, you're right until he got in office and it was suddenly like holy crap. I can't do anything [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5817.46s)]
*  Well, look at us here now four years later from the end of Trump's presidency where you know when he ended it was late 2020 covid [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5822.46s)]
*  We were being told everything was a conspiracy theory lab leak that's a conspiracy theory all this stuff that you know, I can't talk about [[01:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5829.46s)]
*  You know the medicines that could treat coven and a cove it high hydroxy chloroquine and all that stuff [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5836.46s)]
*  And you're a conspiracy theorist if you think the vaccines might injure you etc. Well now here we are four years later. He's back in office [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5842.46s)]
*  And deep state starting to look a lot more real even to people who never do conspiracy, right? [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5849.46s)]
*  It's like well, you know that t-shirt like all my conspiracy theories have come true, right? [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5856.46s)]
*  I mean, it's like it just depends they apply this scary framing to it [[01:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5861.46s)]
*  But if you just break it down into what people mean by the deep state, it's the blob a thing that governs that it's not elected [[01:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5866.46s)]
*  That is more powerful than the president. I mean at the end of the day [[01:37:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5872.46s)]
*  Donald Trump was erased from the internet at the end of his presidency the first time around it was and then we're supposed to believe there's not this like all these powers rising up against him or something [[01:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5875.46s)]
*  It's it's if you just break that down. It's like that was the state working with the tech industry to do something [[01:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5884.46s)]
*  That was really crazy and frightening to me at the time. That was way scarier than anything that happened on January 6 was the ability to just snuff out a politician who had a lot of support in the country [[01:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5890.46s)]
*  And I think that that is over and there are a lot of reasons that that's over but they're going down swinging [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5900.46s)]
*  I just want to say like a minute we'll say goodbye to our serious exam audience [[01:38:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5905.46s)]
*  But we're going to continue the discussion on pod and YouTube dot com slash Megan Kelly [[01:38:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5909.46s)]
*  But they're not going down without a fight because they filed a lawsuit to try to stop these terminations [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5912.46s)]
*  What's really happening is they're offering buyouts [[01:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5918.46s)]
*  They're saying if you want to leave the federal government, go ahead and leave and we'll give you eight months salary, which is much more generous than they would get otherwise [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5920.46s)]
*  And please go and some fifty thousand reportedly have said, okay, we'll go not just out of, you know, Department of Education, but just across the government [[01:38:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5927.46s)]
*  But now these unions have come in filed lawsuits saying you're not allowed to do that [[01:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5935.46s)]
*  Right. These salaries are only funded through March. Don't believe them [[01:39:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5940.46s)]
*  You're not going to get your eight months like on a technicality like you can't trust them [[01:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5944.46s)]
*  They're not going to give you any money past March [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5948.46s)]
*  Don't take the buyout because they make their business and their bones by keeping all the stuffing in the system [[01:39:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5949.46s)]
*  Yeah, they need as many numbers as they can as they as they can hold on to to exercise power over the US taxpayer [[01:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5956.46s)]
*  I mean, I think the concept of just a government a government union in general is kind of crazy [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5963.46s)]
*  Like a private union is one thing but a government union is essentially government workers bargaining with government workers against the taxpayer [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5968.46s)]
*  It's not there like they're always going to sign the worker that doesn't make any sense at all [[01:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5976.46s)]
*  I just don't understand that conceptually and I mean this stuff I was actually wondering what your take on this [[01:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5980.46s)]
*  What because I don't fully understand the lawsuit part and kind of what the odds are there and how well they stopped it for now [[01:39:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5984.46s)]
*  I think that they're going to lose that lawsuit [[01:39:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5990.46s)]
*  I think Trump absolutely has the power to reduce the federal government and to reduce the money that he's paying in the federal government [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5992.46s)]
*  That is 100% within the function of the executive [[01:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5997.46s)]
*  So he had a Clinton appointee who struck it down for now but but that will be reversed [[01:39:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=5999.46s)]
*  So I like this that you're targeting a group of I think young men who are feeling kind of disaffected unloved undervalued [[01:40:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6004.46s)]
*  And you're very open about the fact that they should be catered to and actually I heard in your in your article [[01:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6012.46s)]
*  Something I didn't know existed which was the tech right? Oh, yes, I think that that was a phrase I who knows who coins these things [[01:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6019.46s)]
*  People always claim, you know ownership of a coinage, but I started referring to it that referring to it as that recently [[01:40:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6027.46s)]
*  I mean, I think that it just became very obvious that was what was happening once Elon took Twitter and the sort of censorship ended [[01:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6033.46s)]
*  And the false amplification of different stories ended and people just started talking more and I had been sort of saying a bit more before that [[01:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6041.46s)]
*  Feeling sort of isolated but suddenly it was very apparent. There were there's a lot of support and and it was not it was not what we previously thought [[01:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6048.46s)]
*  You need a name for it, especially now that it's in the White House. Do we think tech was all left? I think that I think tech employees definitely skew left [[01:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6056.46s)]
*  You can just look at the numbers in terms of political donations and things like that. It definitely overwhelmingly skews left [[01:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6064.46s)]
*  But among the people who actually built things so like founders of companies both the startup level and then at the sort of executive level of the [[01:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6069.46s)]
*  Giant companies the publicly traded companies. There's just plenty of support for I would say common sense pro business pro technology type policies [[01:41:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6077.46s)]
*  Which we just didn't really see any of under the Biden administration. In fact, you saw really while Elon took over over Twitter took it private [[01:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6087.46s)]
*  You saw the Biden administration really kind of go after the technology industry and once that happened it was like well, where do you go? [[01:41:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6095.46s)]
*  And I think that you had people like David Sacks out there. Yeah, this flag and love him Peter teal my boss previously like for years like [[01:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6104.46s)]
*  He was he put himself out there early on. Yes. And then you had and then you had Elon and it was just like very easy suddenly or not easy [[01:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6113.46s)]
*  But much easier than ever before for someone who disagreed with a lot of the sort of deranged exes of the far left that you had seen before that to stand up and say [[01:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6120.46s)]
*  I don't agree with that shit. That's not what I'm here for. I'm what do you make us so this reminds me not I am fascinated by the fact that of course all the tech executives showed up to the inauguration [[01:42:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6129.46s)]
*  But did you see my Mark Zuckerberg's comments about Sheryl Sandberg blamed her for the wokeness at Meta? Yeah, reportedly and said she was the one responsible for tampons in the men's room [[01:42:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6138.46s)]
*  And all that shit is done. You know, he's doing the jujitsu. He grew the hair out. He's pro Trump like what a shift by the way [[01:42:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6151.46s)]
*  There's a report in the news today that some rogue employees at Facebook or Meta did put tampons back in the men's room [[01:42:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6160.46s)]
*  Revolution sanctioned. Yes, if there was their act of civil disobedience [[01:42:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6167.46s)]
*  But I thought that was actually very interesting. I mean that those two they were very tight for a long time and they're you know, it is interesting [[01:42:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6172.46s)]
*  I think a lot of people want to not believe that and they want to believe that Mark's lying or something. I and I understand it [[01:42:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6178.46s)]
*  It's like well, he was in charge. He could have just changed things or whatever [[01:43:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6184.46s)]
*  He was a young guy when he met Sheryl who was much older and wiser you would think [[01:43:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6187.46s)]
*  Who knows I don't know him and I don't know what was happening with them [[01:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6194.46s)]
*  I know that I believe that I believe where he is right now. I believe that when I first started writing pirate wires before it was a company back when it was just me writing [[01:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6196.46s)]
*  I covered the his hospital he donated a lot of money to a hospital in San Francisco and the city government had decided to rename it was named after him [[01:43:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6204.46s)]
*  They were going to take it back at the height. It was 2020. It was like the country had de facto legalized writing [[01:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6213.46s)]
*  It was like at the the height of the insanity at that point and I think that really was a pilling moment for him [[01:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6218.46s)]
*  It was that plus he had people inside of his the Zuckerberg Chan [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6227.46s)]
*  I think it's called the initiative is their their nonprofit who were who demanded that he resign at that point over whatever invented crimes of racism had existed at that time [[01:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6232.46s)]
*  He had never done anything. He was just this guy trying to run his company and I think that was the beginning but he had no friends [[01:44:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6240.46s)]
*  I mean everybody was isolated back then my sense as someone who talked to a lot of people was that everybody sort of agreed but nobody would say anything and he was one of them [[01:44:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6246.46s)]
*  And he also had the pressure of the entire state bearing down on him because he was seen as the speech platform I think seen correctly as this very important speech platform [[01:44:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6255.46s)]
*  So I think he was maybe scared and I want to give him some grace. I think at the end of the day what he stands for now publicly I am aligned with and I'm rooting for him [[01:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6264.46s)]
*  And we need him. Yes, we need him. Yes, many strong soldiers on this side of the aisles we can get. Yes, you know, it's interesting [[01:44:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6273.46s)]
*  I went out to the all in summit in September, late September and Elon was there and all the guys were there from the all in podcast and it was all tech guys in the audience [[01:44:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6279.46s)]
*  Some gals, but it was mostly male young, you know, I would say mostly in their young 30s mid 30s maybe and I couldn't believe how right leaning they seemed [[01:44:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6290.46s)]
*  Yeah, I was saying all the things I say, you know on gender I ripped on Kamala Harris's intelligence, you know, like all the stuff I've defended Trump on the law fair [[01:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6300.46s)]
*  They kept clapping. Yeah, like a lot. I had the support of the crowd and I was like, what is this place? What's happening out here? [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6309.46s)]
*  Like this is supposed to be tech, which I think Kara Swisher tells me she's got her finger on the pulse and she's as left as they come. She knows nothing [[01:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6316.46s)]
*  She has no idea what she's talking about. You're exactly right about the all in crowd. And the thing about that show is those are very intelligent men. Sax I think especially is an intellectual [[01:45:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6323.46s)]
*  And you this attracts a sort of smart crowd of people. Not just this like it's not just like this rah rah sort of right wing podcast at all. It's like a kind of thoughtful tech business show [[01:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6334.46s)]
*  And I always had good experience with people in San Francisco. It's like this kind of strange idea that people find surprising. I think there were a lot of people in San Francisco who just like an intellectual and that's what they gravitate towards and they're going to listen to people [[01:45:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6345.46s)]
*  And they weren't really visible because nobody was allowing them to speak before and nobody was producing content for them. When I started writing, I wasn't looking for a male audience. I was just like, I can't stand what I'm seeing anymore. And I need to say something [[01:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6359.46s)]
*  And I was protected because I worked and still work for Peter. And it's like, well, if I have this much protection and I'm not saying anything like who is going to say something? Yeah, I have to say something. But it's sad to me to think of, by the way, my EP wants me to remind everybody that Jason and Shamatha are going to be on the podcast a week from today. Let's go. But I think it's sad because when you're in Republican circles, it's hard enough, you know, before let's let's go before the election before Trump won again and before Elon came out on the campaign trial. It's hard enough. If you have a big business or you're a big business, you're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're a big business. You're [[01:46:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6373.46s)]
*  an up and comer in a very left leaning industry to show show your politics or be open at all about what your political leanings are. But it's gone beyond that for so long to where, you know, young men not only had to say the right things, right, they had to hide their politics if they were all right leaning, but had to be shamed just for being male. Yeah, that's it. Never mind if you're white male, forget about it. And that, you know, we can laugh like, oh, it's so stupid. But it actually really has done a number [[01:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6403.46s)]
*  on like an entire generation and it's such bullshit. Yes. Yeah, it's male behavior specifically. So you could see people starting to freak out about a character who was getting more attention online. Maybe it was Elon Musk or something before Elon was revealing any of his politics just because of there's like a cadence the way he speaks or he's using some words like that are kind of bro. Anything that was masculine coded was attacked. It was considered suspicious immediately. Even just competitiveness. I think back to Travis Kalanick, who got railroaded [[01:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6433.46s)]
*  at a time when he had no support in the technology industry. I mean, I you can look back. I was tweeting about it, but I had no followers back then. So sorry, Travis. I wasn't. Give me one. He wrote that women engineers didn't write anything. He Travis Travis had Travis ran Uber. Oh, yeah, sorry. I'm confusing him with James D'Amore. Yeah, okay. Hashtag fired for truth. He was just in a very Asperger way kind of like talking about the bell curve of distributions or something. Okay. Yeah, no, no, Travis. I watched the Uber. [[01:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6463.46s)]
*  But so Travis, I mean, he gets railroaded, I think, really for acting like a man like he was considered too aggressive and things. And it was very weird kind of following that just the unapologetic maleness of him at a time when you did have people who were much softer and acting much softer. And I think that's just at this point. I don't know if it's over. I just know that you're allowed to be a guy now. And when I started writing, yes, it was. [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6493.46s)]
*  Like a lot of men started following me, but I didn't. I wouldn't set out to do that. And I don't even now. Right. It's innate. It's innate. And that when they saw you saying the things and writing the things that they knew to be true, it would be a natural gravitation to hear more of it, to read more of it. And now I feel like they've been empowered. And there are some women who are like, well, we don't want them to be empowered to the point where they're all Andrew Tate. Right. Right. Like that's Andrew Tate was only popular because nobody else was saying the few reasonable things that he was saying. So he was like, [[01:48:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6523.46s)]
*  he's this, I think, very bad person, actually. Agreed. And he would also say things like wokeness is stupid. And everyone's like, yes, well, thank you for someone for saying it. And so he was rewarded because no one else, none of the good men would say anything. And so this I have to I'm like, well, that's just that's the reason. And I think that actually he'll probably the star will continue to diminish now that the over 10 window is broadened enough where the things that he was saying that were actually important can be said by anybody. I was just talking with Victor Davis Hansen about this change in the Super Bowl ads, you know, like, [[01:49:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6553.46s)]
*  back in the era. And remember the Gillette ad with like a super soft guy? Like, I defend Justin Baldoni in this lawsuit with Blake Lively, because I think she's horrible. And she's made up this whole thing because she tried to steal his movie. But he is the most overly feminized man I've had to endure in recent history. Everything he says is self-flagellating over the fact that he's a man. Every sentence is declarative. Yeah, they're they're they're couched in a million. Like, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. But he's to me is sort of the embodiment [[01:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6583.46s)]
*  of what happens when you totally emasculate a man. And then she continued, you know, she she took that stiletto and stuck it in his heart when he was down there, self-flagellating being so sorry for anything having to do with his testosterone. And so that's what happens to you, right? You then you want what run into somebody who seems like a witch who will take advantage of you and hurt you until finally even that kind of a guy rises up. Now he didn't do it himself. Exactly. He hired a badass named Brian Friedman. And he has badass women like me defending [[01:50:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6613.46s)]
*  him. But slowly but surely, I think the male class is learning down on the floor squirming and apologizing for being a man is not the way. No, well, you're you're hated at that point. You're hated by women and men. Men quietly see that and are like, like, why would you do that? And women don't respect that. So if it's like if you don't act like yourself unapologetically in the world, there is no upside ever. So you have to just speak. Unfortunately, we're in a place now where you can do that. And I also that [[01:50:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6643.46s)]
*  makes me sort of not want to there's this whole class of people now who are trying to kind of like ride the coattails of that. People who maybe just discovered the anti-wokeness stuff a year ago for what is the Bill Ackman, for example, seems like a nice guy thinks that he invented this late to the party. It's like very late to the party. And like, you don't get a medal now for saying that, you know, racism is bad. Even when it's white people and that like the sexes exist. Like, I don't I don't need you now. [[01:51:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6673.46s)]
*  We didn't really need him now this last time, maybe for the Harvard stuff. But how important was that in the grants and things like very probably not. So I'm just over that stuff. I hear you. I've had Bill on the show and I appreciate his same like with the Zuckerberg. We'll take you. Welcome aboard. Love it. But yeah, late to the party for sure. And, you know, for those of us who had real skin in this game for a long time, it is funny to see the Johnny come lately is like, I have saved the day. You're like, yeah, it's like it's nice, but have a seat. Yeah. Have you really? So what is the [[01:51:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6703.46s)]
*  next four years hold? Because under Trump, woke ism grew, you know, the resistance, they grew, they had their boogeyman. And under Biden, they tried to make it explode. You know, they tried to have, you know, they're so upset about big balls. But let's not forget who they brought to the White House to the White House. Actually, we have this queued up because I knew you were coming and I baked this cake. This is what Biden did in sought 31. [[01:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6733.46s)]
*  It is an honor. Friends rights for human rights. Are we talking about the White House? Yeah, this is a man named Rose Montoya who showed his fake boobs on the front of the White House. So this was pushed on us by the White House. But I think the culture was swinging the other way as this became more in your face. Yeah. So what happens now under these next four years? Well, I think unfortunately for anyone right of center, it's going to play a lot differently than the left. The thing about the left is I think it's super [[01:52:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6763.46s)]
*  coherent. And the constellation of kind of leftist ideas are all targeting the same stuff. What you're seeing now, this sort of massive alliance on the kind of like anti woke side is a lot of people who believe a lot of very different things, including many center leftists who are aligned against a lot of this stuff. And I think it's really unclear what the kind of philosophical disposition of the right even is right now. Certainly to me, I mean, I remember people talking about things like taxation and health care on the right people talking about like, how important not like that's just a [[01:53:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6793.46s)]
*  very different conversation. And Trump is an economic populist. So I have a question mark there. I think that they will be effective. I'm hopeful that they will be very effective at cutting out a lot of the rot inside of the bureaucratic state and getting things to move more efficiently and cutting out a lot of the waste. And then I think it will come down to just the American people and deciding what they want to be. I don't think that anybody knows right now. I think that we all agree on what we don't want to be. And that was important. And it is even important kind of now. But it's a [[01:53:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6823.46s)]
*  lot about to be a lot less important. And I don't I just don't know. Yeah, it's like when you look around at your life and you realize you put on an extra 200 pounds and you're not married and you don't have kids and you've been drinking too much and you feel gross and you've been having bad visits with doctors. You need you to lose weight. You know you need to lose weight. You got to get on the treadmill. You should stop drinking so much. You should try to get a job. You should maybe throw your hat into the dating pool. But that's a process. And then when [[01:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6853.46s)]
*  you're healthier and you feel better and you look better then you can ask yourself the question of what do I do now that I'm well again. What do I do. And we're at the oh my god I've gained 200 pounds phase of it. Yeah I feel like we're on the treadmill now. You know we're walking on the treadmill but we got some miles to go. [[01:54:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L_Rl35dmYP4&t=6883.46s)]
