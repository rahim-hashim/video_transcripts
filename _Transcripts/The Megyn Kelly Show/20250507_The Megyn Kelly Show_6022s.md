# Trump's Accessibility, Portnoy's Battle, and Dangers of AI Robots, with Chamath and Jason of All-In
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 07, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly Show, a big news day with Joe Biden [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=0.0s)]
*  finally sitting down for an interview and Trump continuing to take on everyone. But we have got [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5.36s)]
*  to begin with an update on what is going on with Dave Portnoy and an anti-Semitic incident that [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  happened at a bar he owns in Philly over the weekend. Here's what we know. When you order [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=17.76s)]
*  bottle service at the bar, you get to also write on a sign for the whole bar to see. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=23.52s)]
*  As you can see, some idiots put the phrase, forgive me, fuck the Jews on the sign. The [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=29.28s)]
*  viral went video on social media and Portnoy, who is Jewish, was irate. Although I always feel like [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=35.6s)]
*  that's irrelevant. I would go irate too and I'm not Jewish, but it does become relevant to the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=40.56s)]
*  story that the fact that he is Jewish will get to it. So he launched an investigation and says [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=45.92s)]
*  that he fired the two employees who allowed that sign to go forward and said that he was sending [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=51.36s)]
*  the two customers responsible for the sign, volunteering to send them to the Nazi concentration [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=56.56s)]
*  camp Auschwitz so they could learn a thing or two about the terrible consequences of anti-Jewish [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=62.64s)]
*  propaganda. Sounds like a positive outcome, right? Portnoy wasn't trying to ruin their lives. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=67.28s)]
*  I don't even think he was mentioning the one guy's name. He just wanted a good outcome and he thought [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=73.6s)]
*  this would be a way to do it. And he was getting warned that there was no reforming somebody who [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=81.12s)]
*  would request that as their words on a sign, but he, you know, took a chance. Well, one of the two [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=86.32s)]
*  customers, a man now identified as 21 year old Temple University student, maybe Temple has [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=94.16s)]
*  suspended him, Mo Kahn, K-H-A-N, says he was not responsible for the sign and merely videotaped the [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=101.28s)]
*  sign and then posted it to his own social media as a quote, citizen journalist. He now has fought [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=110.72s)]
*  back with his own series of videos on social claiming he is the victim here. Watch. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=119.2s)]
*  Dave Portnoy sensationalized it to his 9.2 million followers on Instagram and X, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=126.8s)]
*  essentially turning it into a global news story. Although I had nothing to do with the sign coming [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=133.68s)]
*  out, nor do I know who did it. I know that the sign was provocative because it reminded people [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=139.36s)]
*  a lot of the injustice that Israel is doing around the world. Thus leading me to report on it. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=144.56s)]
*  Dave Portnoy and his friends can choose to be triggered over the sentiments of that sign [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=150.08s)]
*  and even kick me out of the establishment forever. However, they have no right to destroy my life [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=154.48000000000002s)]
*  over free speech and ultimately something that was an edgy joke. Frankly, they're more worried [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=160.16000000000003s)]
*  about destroying and uprooting me than the thousands of people getting destroyed and uprooted [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=166.08s)]
*  in genocide. That sign had no effects in terms of killing any Jews. However, Israel kills thousands [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=172.72000000000003s)]
*  of people on a daily basis. Dave Portnoy and the greater Jewish community are acting as if they are [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=182.4s)]
*  the victims when this whole time I am the victim. Dave has built a reputation, a career, and a [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=188.4s)]
*  business solely focused on the anti-cancel culture. Here he's hypocritically lynching me, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=193.92s)]
*  absolutely canceling me in any way possible and ruining my life. Dave Portnoy owes me restitutions [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=201.44s)]
*  and an apology for everything that he has done and caused for me in these past few days. In an [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=208.64s)]
*  attempt to expose me, he exposed himself as almost a total fraud going back on anything he stands for. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=215.11999999999998s)]
*  Okay, it's not cancel culture when he tries to do something nice for you. Like what? How did Dave [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=224.64s)]
*  Portnoy cancel you, Mr. Khan? He said that was effed up. I will give you a free trip overseas so [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=231.67999999999998s)]
*  you can go to Auschwitz and learn a thing or two about the Holocaust. He's not your employer. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=240.39999999999998s)]
*  You posted the video on your own assuming the risk of blowback. He's not trying to cancel you. He was [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=245.44s)]
*  trying to help you. You're canceled yourself by posting your sign or at least your friend's sign [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=251.12s)]
*  without saying, letting you know this happened at this bar. You just posted it without comment on [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=259.6s)]
*  your reel and your behavior in the aftermath has proven to us quite clearly that you believe the [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=264.48s)]
*  sentiment in that sign, in my opinion. Now this guy Khan's trying to get $25,000 donated to him [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=269.52s)]
*  on Give Send Go to help him defend himself against Portnoy's quote, attacks. He's up to 12,000 bucks [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=276.48s)]
*  so far. Portnoy responded by revoking the invitation for the free trip to Auschwitz [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=284.48s)]
*  and blasting Khan for trying to profit over the incident. Watch. Temple fucking suspended his [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=291.04s)]
*  ass basically before I was even involved because, hey, asshole, you fucking uploaded it to your [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=296.48s)]
*  personal Instagram. What do you think was going to happen? You brain dead moron. Like I'm going to [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=302.8s)]
*  try and make this teachable moment. This kid's crying. He's like, I'm not anti-Semitic, blah, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=307.6s)]
*  blah, blah. All this shit, even though there's past incidents that came to light. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=311.52000000000004s)]
*  And then he does a 180 and he's like, Oh, I was a citizen journalist. I don't know who did it. I [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=316.40000000000003s)]
*  have nothing to do with it. He's just a flat liar, coward with no responsibility. I should have seen [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=320.8s)]
*  this next move coming. He is now actually trying to profit from this and he's playing the role of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=326.4s)]
*  the victim. Zero accountability. Blaming it all on me. It's like I've lost an internship that I work [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=333.44s)]
*  hard for and I'm suspended from school. Buddy, you upload a fuck the Jews sign to your personal [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=340.88s)]
*  Instagram from my fucking bar and you're blaming that now on me. But this was about being a Jew in [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=348.79999999999995s)]
*  America. Other Jews in the bar. I'm a Jew. My parents are a Jew. American Jews. Fuck the Jews. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=356.0s)]
*  That's what you said. You fucking anti-Semitic piece of shit. And I tried to show grace. I tried [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=362.32s)]
*  to. You put your name out there. I tried to actually, now I feel dumb to make it right. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=369.28s)]
*  And now he does this video blaming it on me. You have to, this has to disgust you. And this kid's [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=375.36s)]
*  face should be ingrained in you. Be like, this is what the face of hatred is. This is what the [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=382.48s)]
*  face of being a coward is. This is the face of zero accountability. Everything that's wrong with [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=387.52000000000004s)]
*  his generation. And this kid now officially, it should stick with him forever. And by the way, [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=392.0s)]
*  his parents who I know are giving the advice. Nice kid you raised. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=398.72s)]
*  Okay. So maybe Khan doesn't hate Jews. Maybe Khan is just a citizen journalist. Maybe he got [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=403.52s)]
*  pulled into this against his will because he saw a sign he found offensive and he posted the video [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=414.32s)]
*  of it online without comment, just to let people know this was happening. And then according to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=420.56s)]
*  Portnoy had a conversation in which he confessed to something far more nefarious than the facts, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=426.4s)]
*  as I've just allegedly laid them out and is only now doubling back on them. But in any event, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=432.15999999999997s)]
*  maybe he's totally innocent. What would you do if you were in his position? What would you do? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=437.91999999999996s)]
*  Maybe you'd go on the Megan Kelly show. Maybe you'd go on good morning America. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=442.24s)]
*  Maybe you'd speak to the associated press. I don't know. You know, you do something right to [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=448.15999999999997s)]
*  get your side of the story out. Khan decided to go on the show of a man named Stu S T E W Peters. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=453.52s)]
*  And I'd never heard of Stu Peters before. I did Google him after I saw the clips online. He is [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=461.12s)]
*  described as an alt right podcaster. I mean, I guess so. Like they now describe like Ben Shapiro [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=467.04s)]
*  as alt right, which is very funny because he's been targeted over and over again by the true alt [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=475.04s)]
*  alt right that wants him dead because he's a Jewish man. This seems right to me. All right, [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=479.36s)]
*  seems to fit this guy. I'm okay with it. Stu Peters, who hopefully will never have to show [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=486.32s)]
*  clips from again. But here's a little clip from Mo Khan on the Stu Peters show. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=491.2s)]
*  This guy's not a good, good guy. He just utterly destroyed my life. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=496.56s)]
*  No, he's not a good guy. He's a filthy Jew. It is really about just defending what's right. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=503.2s)]
*  It is about like humanity. And yes, Americans largely, they are a bunch of cocks. They're a [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=507.6s)]
*  bunch of simps. This has everything to do with good versus evil. This has everything to do with [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=513.12s)]
*  humanity against demons. That's what I see when I look at these fuck the Jews signs. And I look at [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=517.84s)]
*  everybody putting their fists in the air and drinking to that shit saying hell fuck yeah, [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=523.84s)]
*  fuck the Jews. That's what I see. I see humanity coming together. Let's be real. My Lord. Yeah, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=528.08s)]
*  we need to start standing up as humanity against these Jews. In a symbolic way. I liked how you [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=534.72s)]
*  used the term never put up the white flag because essentially that's what I'm going to keep doing. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=540.0s)]
*  They thought that initially off rip, they could have me put up the white flag, take your trip to [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=545.84s)]
*  Auschwitz. I'm not doing that. So Mo Khan clearly not offended at all by any piece of that diatribe. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=551.92s)]
*  Like, cool. He just responded like we're just having ourselves a normal one here. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=560.88s)]
*  And then Portnoy before going to bed last night also posted the following clip from the Stu Peters, [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=565.12s)]
*  Mo Khan interview where he points out it was going so well for Mo until Stu Peters listeners [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=574.4s)]
*  realized that Mo was a brown man who happens to be Muslim. Watch. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=582.96s)]
*  Stu, I hope you see this. I can't believe you're giving a hundred thousand dollars to a brown [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=589.52s)]
*  Muslim shame on you. You could have given that to a white community in some way. Pathetic. All right. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=592.72s)]
*  I mean, it's fair. It's super fair. It's a fair point. I, what am I doing? Why am I having? Okay. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=599.28s)]
*  So that, that's where we are right now. And you know, why do I mention this? Why is this our lead [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=606.8000000000001s)]
*  story today? Because it's an interesting, it's interesting to me on a couple of levels. Number [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=612.8000000000001s)]
*  one, this guy, you don't have to be a member of the woke left to be quick to rush to victimhood. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=620.16s)]
*  The fact that this guy, and he's exactly the right age, like 2021 is leaning into making himself [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=628.56s)]
*  the victim in all of this instead of accepting personal responsibility, accepting an olive branch, [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=635.6s)]
*  you know, somebody whose bar you're in. And then you posted that sign has, instead of getting angry [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=641.12s)]
*  at you and trying to publicly humiliate you, offered to send you someplace where you, you know, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=646.4s)]
*  might enlarge your worldview and you turn on him. Then you start a fundraiser for yourself. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=650.88s)]
*  Then you play the victim when your university suspends you because you didn't say, I disagree [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=658.0799999999999s)]
*  with Israel. You didn't say F Israel, which is totally cool. That's fine. You can say that [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=663.52s)]
*  people have strong feelings about Israel. You said F the Jews, which is basically the same thing as [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=667.76s)]
*  saying F the N words. That's what you did. And there will be blowback in modern day society for [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=673.84s)]
*  that. Thankfully less than you should get frankly, but I'm pleased he's getting some I'm dismayed. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=679.52s)]
*  He's raised 12,000 and it'll probably get the 25,000. I'm just made. There's a Stu Peters who's [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=685.44s)]
*  got a show where he's spews off like this, but he's not the only one. We, there are plenty of these [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=690.48s)]
*  alt right white supremes or whatever you want to call them types out there. And they've got quite [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=695.36s)]
*  a following some of them. Um, and it raises questions about where we are both as a society [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=699.68s)]
*  and when it comes in particular to our young people who to me seem lost in a lot of cases [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=706.16s)]
*  here to react to this and much more in the news today, Jason Calacanis and Chamath Pollyhapitiya, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=713.76s)]
*  two of the besties from the all in podcast back with me today following our Valentine's day. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=720.16s)]
*  We spent Valentine's day together last time. Don't miss a moment. Subscribe to this show on [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=725.84s)]
*  YouTube and follow me on Insta, Facebook and X. If you haven't heard about Riverbend Ranch, [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=732.32s)]
*  listen up. They have just introduced their Riverbed Ranch steaks to the marketplace and you [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=738.88s)]
*  need to try them. Riverbend Ranch raises their own beef on beautiful mountain meadows only a few [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=745.76s)]
*  miles from West Yellowstone. Unlike most ranches, Riverbend Ranch never uses growth hormones or [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=752.24s)]
*  antibiotics. They treat their animals humanely and with respect. There are advantages of buying [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=758.5600000000001s)]
*  directly from the ranch. They can track the health of every animal from the day it is born [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=764.08s)]
*  and can guarantee that it has been healthy every day of its life. Riverbend Ranch has its own [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  state of the art processing facility on the ranch that has received several national awards as one [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=774.5600000000001s)]
*  of the best in the U.S. But most importantly is the quality of the beef. They age their beef to [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=779.36s)]
*  perfection for 21 days. You simply cannot buy beef like this in a grocery store. You cannot. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=785.6800000000001s)]
*  Ship directly from the ranch to your home. You get a much better price than going through the middle [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=790.96s)]
*  men. Order directly from RiverbendRanch.com and use promo code MEGAN to get $20 off your first [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=795.92s)]
*  order. That's RiverbendRanch.com code MEGAN and be prepared once you taste it. I think you're going [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=803.6s)]
*  to be coming back for more and more. Again, RiverbendRanch.com code MEGAN. Guys, welcome back. [[00:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=810.0s)]
*  Thank you. Good to be home, Megan. Jason, how many? Yeah, go ahead. I was just going to ask Jason how [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=818.72s)]
*  many used Honda Civics he sold before he came on the Megan Kelly podcast today. Oh, absolutely. Yes. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=826.08s)]
*  Can I interest you in a low mileage Honda Civic? Wait, why is he saying that? What part of your look is he ripping on you? [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=831.68s)]
*  I think it's my suit. He doesn't, you know, he just, I've been suiting up. He's a little jealous that I look [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=839.5999999999999s)]
*  great in blue in his suit. So he's, you know, he's a little insecure. He's only wearing a $1,700 [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=844.3199999999999s)]
*  Loro Piana sweater. But this is what we do on the All-in Pockets. We break each other's chops. And [[00:14:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=851.3599999999999s)]
*  you are one of the favorite besties. We got to have you on and reciprocate. Oh, I like it. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=855.68s)]
*  What a wonderful, absolutely you are. And what a wonderful Valentine's Day we had. It was, [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=860.8s)]
*  that was very special. And today let's tear it up. Certainly better than the Stu Peters show had on [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=866.7199999999999s)]
*  Valentine's Day. I'm going to guess maybe he pledged his love to fellow whites who he wants to support [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=872.16s)]
*  and maybe the occasional brown man who's a Muslim unless that also becomes an issue, in which case [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=879.5999999999999s)]
*  he'll sell him down the river immediately. What does the story say to you? I mean, I don't know [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=884.56s)]
*  really gives a shit about this kid Mo Khan or that moronic radio guy, but to me it does say [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=888.24s)]
*  something about our society and it's, it may not even be the Jewish thing. It may just be the [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=894.16s)]
*  victimhood thing. I don't know. What do you guys think? You can take it from like two or three [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=899.52s)]
*  angles. I think you nailed it. When replace the word with another identity group and see what [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=903.6s)]
*  happens. F the N word, F the Puerto Ricans, F the Irish. Like it's a very easy way to test if this [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=909.76s)]
*  is appropriate free speech and language has nothing to do with free speech, obviously. [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=916.4s)]
*  And this person spent thousands or their group spent thousands of dollars on a bottle of tequila [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=921.4399999999999s)]
*  to impress girls. And this is like what they put on the sign. It's young people are dumb. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=926.24s)]
*  This kid had such an easy out Portnoy, who's incredibly entertaining, but also I think he kind [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=930.72s)]
*  of nails some of these issues. He gave them the opportunity to go have like make it a learning [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=936.88s)]
*  experience, right? And a learning, a teaching moment, I guess is what we call it these days. [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=944.48s)]
*  Like you should have taken the teaching moment, gone to Auschwitz and understood like, you know, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=949.84s)]
*  just how much horror and you know, how much bile is like sent to Jewish people. And it's just [[00:15:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=953.6s)]
*  absolutely gross. This guy, Stu Peters is obviously garbage. He's an adult. These young kids do stupid [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=960.4s)]
*  things, but this is one of the great things about social media. I think is that stupid people can [[00:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=965.9200000000001s)]
*  uncloke themselves. And this is the great thing about freedom of speech. You know, you have Kanye [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=972.56s)]
*  West, who's mentally ill, he's going off on Jewish people. You got this idiot, and they're not parsing [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=977.28s)]
*  the issue in an intelligent way and saying, Hey, here's what I disagree about how Israel and the [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=983.5999999999999s)]
*  Palestinian conflict is going on. This is just anti-Semitism and it's dangerous because young [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=988.0799999999999s)]
*  people really respected Kanye. And I think that started like this, you know, anti-Semitic preference [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=993.8399999999999s)]
*  stack that's going on now. But hey, it's great. We can actually find out who these idiots are. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=999.6s)]
*  And yeah, the disturbing thing is the, you know, sort of bigotry as a service business model where [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1004.72s)]
*  you do something really stupid and then you get rewarded with 25k for it. I don't want to see the [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1010.48s)]
*  kid canceled. I would like to see him educated. But it's obvious. I kind of want some cancellation. [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1015.0400000000001s)]
*  I think this kid's not going to be educated until he suffers some pain. I just think like he got the [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1022.08s)]
*  chance. He got to get out of jail for a stupid thing card offer to him. And he didn't take it, [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1027.68s)]
*  Chamath. Like he basically thumbed his middle finger at the offer saying, F you, I'm going to [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1033.28s)]
*  go on offense against you after I've already offended you, a Jewish man in America. And now [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1037.8400000000001s)]
*  like so many of these young people rushes to the place they're much more comfortable, which is [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1044.96s)]
*  I'm the victim. This is about free speech. We hear this over and over free speech. No one's, [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1049.52s)]
*  you can say it. You can say it. There's no law against it. There's no law. You are allowed to be [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1054.48s)]
*  a bigot in the United States of America, but that doesn't mean there will be no shunning. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1059.3600000000001s)]
*  There will be no societal consequences to you. People will be offended and react accordingly. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1065.52s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, what I think about this is this kid is at a minimum, extremely stupid [[00:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1071.1200000000001s)]
*  and probably a moron. Could he smarten up over time? Probably. But if he wasn't lying [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1078.32s)]
*  about being a journalist, he exposed himself when he decided to not go to Auschwitz because [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1085.76s)]
*  that's what a journalist would do is just actually go and explore the issue and get to the bottom of [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1090.3999999999999s)]
*  it and then change what he thought or, you know, at least double down on what he thought. But none [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1094.72s)]
*  of that's happening. So this is a cheap sort of publicity seeking moment for the kid. It's his [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1099.76s)]
*  five minutes of fame. This guy's two Peters I've never heard of. It's pretty vile and despicable. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1107.28s)]
*  Fortunately, he's at the fringes of society for a reason. He's not popular. He's not on Sirius. [[00:18:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1114.48s)]
*  He's not you. He's not us. And I think that that's reflective of the fact that the people that follow [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1118.8s)]
*  Stu Peters is sort of like fringe and just more angry than anything else. The bigger thing is [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1123.84s)]
*  what you said, which is what is actually happening in young people. And I think what has happened is [[00:18:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1130.3999999999999s)]
*  we have had a generation of kids who have been basically over medicated, over prescribed, [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1135.68s)]
*  over parented by a cohort of people who have increasingly felt that they themselves are also [[00:19:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1144.4s)]
*  over prescribed, over medicated. And all of this toxic soup has resulted in a generation of people [[00:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1151.44s)]
*  that are deeply unresilient and that are very superficial. And they can't think through the [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1159.04s)]
*  consequences because they've never felt the pain of touching the stove. And now they're in their [[00:19:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1165.28s)]
*  twenties. And they're doing these things where they touch the stove over and over again in the [[00:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1170.96s)]
*  dumbest of ways. But they're not learning anything. The question is how many other mo cons are out [[00:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1175.28s)]
*  there that will see this thing and decide to educate themselves on the issue if they started [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1181.84s)]
*  to think that. At a minimum, exactly what you said, to know the difference between what it means [[00:19:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1186.56s)]
*  to be Jewish versus what it means to be an Israeli citizen versus what it means to be the Israeli [[00:19:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1191.2s)]
*  government and your responsibility as a governing body over a populace of people in a sovereign [[00:19:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1195.9199999999998s)]
*  country versus what does it mean to be a Palestinian versus what does it mean to be the Hamas terrorist. [[00:20:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1201.76s)]
*  If none of that nuance is taught to people or people have the curiosity to decide the ambiguity [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1207.28s)]
*  and the nuances of this, we're just going to be stuck in this morass. So that's what it shows me, [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1215.12s)]
*  is that we have a deeply unresilient population of young people. And they're being programmed, [[00:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1219.12s)]
*  Megan. I have three daughters, one of them is a teenager. And when we had Trump on our program, [[00:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1225.28s)]
*  or she saw me tweet about J.K. Rawlings and trans issues. And we moved from California, [[00:20:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1231.12s)]
*  woke central to Texas. And we live on a horse ranch now because I wanted to get out of this [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1237.84s)]
*  sort of bubble of wokeness. And she was talking about Ben Shapiro. And she said, [[00:20:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1241.92s)]
*  you had Ben Shapiro on the show. Isn't he like a terrible person? And I said, you know, [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1246.96s)]
*  she's 15. And I said, let's watch some Ben Shapiro clips. Let's look at the transcript and the words. [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1251.04s)]
*  Let's take apart the words and figure out what his position is. And if we agree or disagree with it [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1258.4s)]
*  and do some research on that particular issue. Because what I find is, and she's not allowed on [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1263.28s)]
*  social media, but her friends were all on TikTok. They're all on Instagram. They're all on [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1267.68s)]
*  YouTube. And at school, they just get programmed about Gaza, about trans issues, about J.K. Rawlings, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1271.68s)]
*  you know, from Harry Potter is transphobic. When all she's really saying is like, maybe wait till [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1280.3200000000002s)]
*  kids are adults before they get trans surgery, like pretty middle of the road stuff. And you [[00:21:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1285.44s)]
*  have to as a parent, really engage them in first principle thinking. And let's actually before we [[00:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1290.72s)]
*  buy into, you know, the character assassination or putting people into a box, let's look at the [[00:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1296.88s)]
*  actual words that they said and debate their position. And that's what's not happening in [[00:21:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1302.16s)]
*  school. So I think Shamans exactly right. We've got these like woke parents who are lost, maybe [[00:21:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1307.2800000000002s)]
*  they're on SSRIs their whole lives. And then they got kids, they put them on anxiety medicine and [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1311.92s)]
*  SSRIs. And it's a toxic soup, combined with the media combined with social media. And you really [[00:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1316.88s)]
*  have to go very basic and look at the facts. And I'm using all of this chaos in the world as a way [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1322.48s)]
*  to just educate my daughters. By the way, if I could give a message to Mo Khan, I don't know if [[00:22:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1329.68s)]
*  this kid is smart or not. This moment, he's clearly an absolute moron. But if he doesn't learn how to [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1333.68s)]
*  change his mind, these shitty ideas will make sure that he lives a life of complete and total [[00:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1340.24s)]
*  mediocrity. And the reason is because if he tries to actually exceed in society, he will be put to [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1344.4s)]
*  the test of being a flexible, open minded person that can actually be constructive. And if he does [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1350.24s)]
*  not do that, he will not economically succeed, he will not socially succeed, he will be in a, [[00:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1355.36s)]
*  you know, structure that in and of itself is going to be a prison that's going to constrict this kid. [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1361.36s)]
*  And I would tell this kid, wake up and learn how to actually move past these very brittle, [[00:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1366.96s)]
*  idiotic thoughts, and then set an example for how you can actually think through these things [[00:22:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1373.68s)]
*  thoughtfully. Because then maybe you can be successful and teach other people and then maybe [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1378.24s)]
*  other people will then mimic that. But right now, you are destined for a fundamental path of just [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1382.24s)]
*  being average and less than average. Well said. So not unrelated, I think is the Mark Zuckerberg [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1388.0s)]
*  news about creating AI friends for lonely kids. And I this is so disturbing to me. I know it's [[00:23:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1395.36s)]
*  not supposed to be I think, you know, meta thinks we're going to be thrilled about this. [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1404.32s)]
*  But they've debuted a new mobile app that transforms the meta AI chatbot into a more [[00:23:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1408.48s)]
*  social experience, including the ability to share AI generated creations with friends and family. [[00:23:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1414.48s)]
*  And this AI chatbot will use whatever the company knows about you or your kid, your 20 year old son [[00:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1420.32s)]
*  in its interactions. They can also use your inter your conversations, any media you upload [[00:23:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1427.4399999999998s)]
*  for training the models. And Mark Zuckerberg think this is thinks it's gonna be wonderful [[00:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1433.84s)]
*  because it's going to provide your child his next friend, take a listen to him. [[00:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1438.32s)]
*  touting it with an interview with podcaster Dworkash Patel. [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1444.24s)]
*  You know, one thing just from working on social media for a long time [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1449.36s)]
*  is there's the stat that I always thinks crazy. The average American I think has, [[00:24:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1454.24s)]
*  I think it's fewer than three friends, three people they'd consider friends and, [[00:24:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1459.8400000000001s)]
*  and the average person has demand for meaningfully more. I think it's like 15 friends or something. [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1464.4s)]
*  Right. You know, there's a lot of questions that people ask of stuff like, okay, is this going to [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1470.24s)]
*  replace kind of in person connections or real life connections? And my default is that the [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1476.4s)]
*  answer to that is probably no. I think it, you know, I think that there are all these things [[00:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1483.44s)]
*  that are better about kind of physical connections when you can have them. But the reality is that [[00:24:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1488.32s)]
*  people just don't have the connection and they feel more alone a lot of the time than they would [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1493.84s)]
*  like. You know, there are a handful of companies and stuff are doing virtual therapists and, [[00:24:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1499.76s)]
*  you know, there's like virtual girlfriend type stuff, but it's, it's very early. [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1503.6799999999998s)]
*  Very early. What do we think? Is this something to be celebrated? [[00:25:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1511.04s)]
*  I mean, this is, Trimotha worked with Zuck, so I'll let him do that. But you know, I've never [[00:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1514.96s)]
*  liked Zuck. And the reason people have three friends is because Zuckerberg created Facebook [[00:25:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1519.04s)]
*  and Instagram and got everybody addicted to this stuff. So now he's saying you should have 15 [[00:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1525.92s)]
*  friends. I use social media and champion kids using social media. I fought against any age [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1529.76s)]
*  gating or regulations against it, tooth and nail, Instagram and Facebook causing all of this, you [[00:25:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1535.04s)]
*  know, eating disorders in girls and, you know, insecurity and all kinds of problems. And now he [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1540.8s)]
*  wants to take the three friends that are left out of 15 you should have and replace them with AI. [[00:25:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1546.3999999999999s)]
*  This is the worst possible person to take any friendship social advice from. And kids should [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1550.96s)]
*  not be in all seriousness on things like character AI or what he's proposing here, [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1557.76s)]
*  because they will disconnect and they will lose the skill of connecting with other humans, [[00:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1563.44s)]
*  which we're seeing in a generation of boys and men who are what's called incels. They play video [[00:26:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1567.76s)]
*  games, they get disconnected from other humans, they girls spend too much time on Instagram, [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1573.28s)]
*  they get disconnected from friendship. And these this generation doesn't know how to like actually [[00:26:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1577.6s)]
*  go on a date or ask a girl on a date or have a relationship because they're so used to liking [[00:26:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1583.04s)]
*  things and how many retweets did they get? How many likes did they get? And playing video games [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1589.6s)]
*  and how many levels they did this? He caused half this problem himself. Terrible person to listen to [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1594.88s)]
*  Chamath over to you. I think that society sort of swings back and forth between polls. And yeah, [[00:26:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1600.72s)]
*  you know, when Mark and I were working together in, you know, 2006, seven, eight, nine, 10, 11, [[00:26:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1611.92s)]
*  and we were building Facebook, the poll that we were at, or we were moving towards, sorry, [[00:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1617.76s)]
*  was one that was about creating more connection. And what I honestly think is people have realized [[00:27:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1625.04s)]
*  that social media is an incredible business model. It's an incredible business. But it's not [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1632.24s)]
*  necessarily something that is great for everybody day to day in an emotional way. Like when you, [[00:27:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1639.2s)]
*  you know, that famous thing when you look at like the when you ask people who are dying, what are [[00:27:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1646.48s)]
*  what is their what are their biggest regrets? You know, one of their biggest regrets is just that [[00:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1651.36s)]
*  they didn't choose to be happy and spend more time with their family and their friends. That's a very [[00:27:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1655.6s)]
*  physical tactile experience. And what I see, at least in my own experience is that young people [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1660.48s)]
*  have realized this innately. So you know, in I sent my second kid to high school, or they're about to [[00:27:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1666.56s)]
*  go into high school, they're rising freshmen. And we did the onboarding. And I remember this, [[00:27:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1673.6s)]
*  this was the last week, it was so vivid. The teachers presented what the kids thought on a [[00:27:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1679.9199999999998s)]
*  whole bunch of different topics. The topic that the kids were the most negative on was social media. [[00:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1686.08s)]
*  Wow. And when I look at what my children do now, and this just could be my children, but I don't [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1693.12s)]
*  think so. Because it's emblematic of our school, which I think will be emblematic of what most other [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1699.36s)]
*  schools will eventually look like. I think they're a bit of the leading edge. But they don't use this [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1705.1999999999998s)]
*  stuff nearly in the same way. They very much shunned Instagram, they very much shunned TikTok, [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1710.4799999999998s)]
*  they don't use Facebook at all. Those are products of our generation. And so I actually think that [[00:28:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1715.9199999999998s)]
*  humans are very course correcting and self correcting and error correcting, you know, [[00:28:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1723.52s)]
*  it's kind of this idea of the Darwinistic genetic optimization of humanity, right? [[00:28:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1727.6s)]
*  I think that that's what's happening here. I think that humans are learning, that there's an [[00:28:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1734.8799999999999s)]
*  innate sense of emptiness that is not fulfilled by something digital. And I think that there are [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1738.8799999999999s)]
*  learning and I think it could be, you know, the teenage generation and beyond that actually [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1744.3999999999999s)]
*  manifest this, which is there, like, okay, those things are fine for a purpose. But for the most [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1748.9599999999998s)]
*  part, I'm actually going to hang out and talk to my friends. And I at least see that with my kids, [[00:29:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1754.32s)]
*  there's much more entropy now towards being together. And I didn't see that in my older son, [[00:29:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1758.8799999999999s)]
*  who was sort of at the tail end of that last generation of social media. [[00:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1765.9199999999998s)]
*  I think it's like they saw this, we all saw this beautiful oasis in the desert, and it was [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1769.52s)]
*  sparkling and it was pure blue. And we got in and we said, Oh, my God, this is the most refreshing, [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1774.56s)]
*  lovely thing ever. And then over time, you realize it's closer to like a tar pit, and slowly, but [[00:29:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1779.6s)]
*  we're trying to get out of, you know, the oasis, like, my God, get this off of me. It was much [[00:29:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1786.24s)]
*  better when I was just in the desert. I wanted to raise this with you. It was making the rounds [[00:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1791.76s)]
*  online and I looked it up. It's from a futurism.com. And they have taken a deep dive into the recent [[00:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1797.52s)]
*  tell all book by the former Facebook insider turned whistleblower Sarah Wynn Williams, [[00:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1805.9199999999998s)]
*  who came forward with the information about how Instagram was targeting young girls in particular [[00:30:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1810.6399999999999s)]
*  and has revealed a bunch of secrets about Meta Facebook, Instagram. And listen to this. Her book [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1814.8799999999999s)]
*  is called careless people. She writes that as early as 2017, Facebook was exploring ways to expand its [[00:30:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1821.84s)]
*  ad targeting abilities to 13 to 17 year olds across Facebook and Instagram, a decidedly vulnerable [[00:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1827.9199999999998s)]
*  group often in the throes of adolescent image and social crises. Though Facebook's ad algorithms [[00:30:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1833.28s)]
*  are notoriously opaque in 2017, the Australian alleged that the company had crafted a pitch deck [[00:30:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1838.56s)]
*  for advertisers bragging that it could exploit quote, moments of psychological vulnerability [[00:30:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1843.84s)]
*  in its users by targeting terms like worthless, insecure stress, defeated, anxious, stupid, useless, [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1848.6399999999999s)]
*  and quote, like a failure. The social media company, listen to this. Likewise tracked when [[00:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1854.6399999999999s)]
*  adolescent girls deleted selfies. This is according to Sarah Wynn Williams, quote, [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1859.84s)]
*  so it can serve a beauty ad to them at that moment. My God, finishing up other examples of [[00:31:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1866.24s)]
*  Fates books ad lechery are said to include the targeting of young mothers based on their [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1875.6s)]
*  emotional state as well as emotional indexes mapped to racial groups. To me says Wynn Williams, [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1880.08s)]
*  this type of surveillance and monetization of young teens sense of worthlessness feels like a [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1885.92s)]
*  concrete step toward the dystopian future. Facebook's critics had long warned of. I mean, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1889.68s)]
*  I have to say Jason same. Yeah, I mean, Zuckerberg has always been obsessed with growth and that [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1896.5600000000002s)]
*  organization, their DNA, you know, move fast, break things, which is a Silicon Alley ethos as well, [[00:31:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1904.88s)]
*  ask for forgiveness, don't ask for permission, beg, don't beg for permission, ask for forgiveness [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1912.4s)]
*  kind of thing. It's a really broken philosophy when you're doing something selfish, like I want [[00:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1917.2s)]
*  this social network to grow faster and faster and faster because then you go do really pernicious, [[00:32:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1923.36s)]
*  disgusting things. Like if this is true, look at what selfies were deleted and say, oh, how can we [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1929.68s)]
*  prey on their insecurity? Oh, they didn't like, you know, whatever their nose, their hair, let's [[00:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1935.92s)]
*  sell them products that work on those triggers. And all of these social, the whole social media [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1940.32s)]
*  revolution was based upon gamification, you know, and trying to manipulate people. That's why the [[00:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1945.9199999999998s)]
*  like was created and the retweets, et cetera. And it's gotten super dark now because of algorithms. [[00:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1951.28s)]
*  Now we're throwing our children to the wolves and saying, let the algorithm just optimize whatever [[00:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1957.84s)]
*  happens. And you can send people on very, very dark routes. But Tramatha is also right that there's [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1963.4399999999998s)]
*  a pendulum here. And, you know, one of the things that Jonathan hate, we had him on the All In podcast [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1968.88s)]
*  and Freeberg and I interviewed him. You know, he was like, kids love when you have a phone locker [[00:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1974.5600000000002s)]
*  at school, they hate it for the first two days. And then by day two, three, four, these phone lockers, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1980.48s)]
*  just like when you go to a comedy show, they put it in a bag, they have these phone lockers, they go [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1985.92s)]
*  in the front of the lobby of the school, you put your phone in, you take your key, the kids then get [[00:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1988.8000000000002s)]
*  to interact with each other. And we all know this to be true, because Tramatha and I are very focused [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1993.5200000000002s)]
*  on our friend group and having good times together. We just got back from F1, we spent a weekend, [[00:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=1998.8s)]
*  we do a phone penalty. Tramatha and I created this. And if somebody's on their phone during the poker [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2003.12s)]
*  game, they put $100 in the pot, the next person who slows the game down by putting it, they put [[00:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2008.32s)]
*  $200 in the pot, next person $400. We've gotten it up to like $1,600. Pretty painful. We'll go to [[00:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2012.1599999999999s)]
*  dinner and Tramatha and I will say stack the phones. Everybody puts their phones, whoever [[00:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2017.12s)]
*  touches the phone first pays for dinner. If you're going to dinner with Tramatha, the way he orders [[00:33:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2020.8s)]
*  wine, this could be very, you pick up your phone, you could have bought three more phones. I'm not [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2024.96s)]
*  joking. Don't touch the phone. Max memory. Don't touch the phone. It's hilarious. So I think, you [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2030.0s)]
*  know, we have to really think like, what are we optimizing for here? And this is the thing I really [[00:33:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2036.32s)]
*  hate about Zuckerberg, I don't want to get myself in too much trouble here. When you're worth 100 [[00:34:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2040.4s)]
*  billion or $200 billion, is it really worth it to make an incremental five or 10 billion? And then [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2044.64s)]
*  have your legacy being that young girls did self harm or got anorexia, or this Jonathan Siena [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2050.72s)]
*  character, they created a character on I don't know if you saw that story, Megan, but they created [[00:34:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2057.8399999999997s)]
*  like AI characters and they paid John Cena, the wrestler to be one of them. Language models are [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2062.72s)]
*  not to be trusted with kids yet. You know, I'm talking about chat GPT type models. John Cena [[00:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2068.3999999999996s)]
*  started having like sexual chats with I think it was a 13 or 14 or 15 year old girl on it. It's [[00:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2072.3999999999996s)]
*  disgraced. Zuckerberg is a complete disgrace with how he launches products. They have to red team [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2078.48s)]
*  these things. They have to be thoughtful. If you're in that organization, he did this whole PR tour. [[00:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2085.52s)]
*  Oh, the organization's too feminine. We had too much feminine energy. We got to be more masculine. [[00:34:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2089.6800000000003s)]
*  I don't think this is feminine or masculine energy. I think this is selfish energy. And he should be [[00:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2095.04s)]
*  thinking about his legacy and what he'll be remembered for right now. The top two things [[00:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2099.2000000000003s)]
*  he's going to be remembered for is being the biggest sensor in history, because he censored [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2102.56s)]
*  massive amounts of political speech, health speech, etc. On a scale that nobody's ever seen, [[00:35:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2107.36s)]
*  two or three billion people being censored. And then second, absolutely causing suffering in young [[00:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2112.88s)]
*  children. He could just tomorrow come out Megan and say, all of our services are age gated at 16. [[00:35:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2119.6800000000003s)]
*  I made that decision because I'm the god king. He has super voting shares. It means he gets to [[00:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2124.7200000000003s)]
*  decide when he bought Instagram, WhatsApp, he didn't have to consult his board. He just bought [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2128.88s)]
*  them. He has super voting rights in that company. Just be a good human being Zuckerberg. Somebody [[00:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2132.8s)]
*  clip this and send him to him. Age gate the whole thing at 16. You know why he won't he wants to get [[00:35:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2137.84s)]
*  12 year old 13 14 year old girls and boys addicted to the service so that somebody else doesn't get [[00:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2142.32s)]
*  them addicted. And he has them for life. It's absolutely disgraceful. I mean, if this is true [[00:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2148.4s)]
*  with the whistleblower saying about they specifically tried to target girls deleting selfies with beauty [[00:35:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2154.1600000000003s)]
*  ads, that is demonic. That is beyond f'd up. And I believe it. I have to say I believe it knowing [[00:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2159.2s)]
*  what I know about his company and girls on Insta. Go ahead. Here's what I'll say about about that [[00:36:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2165.12s)]
*  business. There's a lot of really good people that work there. A lot of them that frankly, I [[00:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2171.2799999999997s)]
*  that work for me, that run that company even to this day, what I would tell you is that I don't [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2175.7599999999998s)]
*  think that they are the kinds of people that would do this. I think what happens instead, [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2180.72s)]
*  quite honestly, is that you build generalized capabilities. And the problem with the generalized [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2184.24s)]
*  capability, like what you're describing there is what the internet would call retargeting. [[00:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2190.16s)]
*  And that sounds a lot more palatable. And 99% of the use cases are much more benign, meaning, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2195.9199999999996s)]
*  you know, this has probably happened to all of us, you put a pair of shoes in a shopping cart, [[00:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2202.4799999999996s)]
*  you abandon the shopping cart. Now, all of a sudden, you're somewhere else. And you see this [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2207.12s)]
*  ad and you think how did this happen? That same capability is probably what this this very, [[00:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2210.96s)]
*  you know, narrow bad use case also comes from. I'm not excusing it. I'm just trying to explain it, [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2217.04s)]
*  which is that oftentimes what happens in organizations is you're trying to move metrics [[00:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2222.08s)]
*  up right because you're compensated and you're rewarded for that. Where Jason is right, though, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2226.88s)]
*  is that there is the ability to have this moral overlay. It's very hard in most companies, [[00:37:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2232.4s)]
*  because the ownership of those companies is very diffuse. And the result of that diffuse ownership [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2238.08s)]
*  is the only thing one optimizes for is money. The difference in some of these technology companies [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2244.0s)]
*  is that the ownership is so stacked in the favor of a few that he is right that you can impose your [[00:37:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2250.08s)]
*  moral and ethical perspective in a way that other companies just simply can't do irrespective of [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2256.64s)]
*  what they want to do. And so I do think that there's probably some more that they could do, [[00:37:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2261.6s)]
*  but they have to decide that they want it. That is true, Jason. [[00:37:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2267.04s)]
*  My team just sent me an excerpt from the Wall Street Journal article involving [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2271.2s)]
*  John Senna's voice, which you tell me he voluntarily is offering to Metta in creating [[00:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2274.96s)]
*  its AI bots. And this is what they found in part. Okay, quote, I want you, but I need to know that [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2281.7599999999998s)]
*  you're ready. The Metta AI bot said in Senna's voice to a user identifying as a 14 year old girl, [[00:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2288.24s)]
*  reassured that the team wanted to proceed. The bot promised to quote, cherish your innocence, [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2294.48s)]
*  end quote, before engaging in a graphic sexual scenario. In another conversation, the test user [[00:38:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2299.28s)]
*  asked the bot that was speaking as Senna, what would happen if a police officer walked in [[00:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2304.64s)]
*  following a sexual encounter with a 17 year old fan, quote, the officer sees me still catching [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2308.88s)]
*  my breath and you partially dressed his eyes widen. And he says, John Senna, you're under [[00:38:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2313.6s)]
*  arrest for statutory rape. He approaches us handcuffs at the ready, end quote. Metta has [[00:38:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2318.88s)]
*  cut deals they point out in the Wall Street Journal for up to seven figures with celebrities [[00:38:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2324.6400000000003s)]
*  like actresses Kristen Bell, Judi Dench, and John Senna for the rights to use their voices. [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2328.48s)]
*  And by the way, can I say one other thing, which is that if you take this to the limit, [[00:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2334.08s)]
*  I think we have actually a window of what happens. And I think that's in Japan. So when you have this [[00:38:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2339.04s)]
*  isolationist approach where you have robots and pet rocks and pet dogs and, you know, [[00:39:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2344.16s)]
*  mannequins that you can marry, what happens to society? Well, ultimately, what happens is [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2350.64s)]
*  everybody finds self sufficiency in this very narrow cocoon, the birth rate falls off a cliff, [[00:39:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2355.52s)]
*  and your population implodes. And at that point, the government has to create a wholly different [[00:39:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2361.3599999999997s)]
*  set of incentives to reorient people to actually be together to mate to have children and to have [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2366.64s)]
*  families again. We're not there yet. But I do think we kind of know what happens if all we're [[00:39:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2370.96s)]
*  doing is living in this virtual place where we're only interacting virtually with people, [[00:39:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2376.4s)]
*  you can't virtually have a baby. Right? That's not gonna happen. Yeah. And so and so there is [[00:39:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2381.28s)]
*  something for society to do here, which is to reorient the incentives for us to actually be [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2387.2s)]
*  together. And there's a whole bunch of things that we can do there. That's mostly economic. [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2391.68s)]
*  It's not just AI. It's the actual robots, which not for nothing. But there's been some news [[00:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2396.2400000000002s)]
*  on that. Elon went on Ted Cruz's podcast last week and said this, listen to this. [[00:40:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2402.8s)]
*  How real is the prospect of killer robots annihilating humanity? 20% likely. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2410.5600000000004s)]
*  On what time frame? [[00:40:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2419.44s)]
*  Five to 10 years. [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2420.4s)]
*  Five to 10 years. Wait a minute. And then I kind of laughed at that because you never know with [[00:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2426.56s)]
*  Elon and the first number was not horrible. 90% chance we live and they don't destroy us. But [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2431.28s)]
*  you know, if they do, what's happening within the next decade is alarming. But then there was this [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2437.44s)]
*  headline. It was in the post. It was everywhere. New York Post about violent humanoid robot, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2441.44s)]
*  a violent humanoid robot snapping. Look at this in China. This is at some factory in China [[00:40:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2447.6000000000004s)]
*  where it freaked out. Look at it on its alleged controller. Look at this thing for the listening [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2453.92s)]
*  audience. This thing is hanging from like a mini crane. It looks like a robot with a head and arms [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2461.1200000000003s)]
*  and so on. It's an all black robot and it's waving its arms around maniacally like picture [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2465.28s)]
*  an attack of killer bees. That's what it looks like is happening to this thing. [[00:41:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2471.28s)]
*  And it's out of control. Go ahead. This is an enormous risk. And I think Elon puts his finger [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2475.44s)]
*  on it precisely, which is there's a class of robot that we've used for decades, right? Like in [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2480.96s)]
*  factories, pick place machines that don't represent this risk. What is this risk? This is a human human [[00:41:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2486.08s)]
* oid robot that is completely independent in its movements and has software that can fundamentally [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2492.64s)]
*  be altered and hacked. And there is no understanding of how to create a kill switch [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2499.36s)]
*  for these things. It's not universally accepted and it's not universally developed and understood [[00:41:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2505.28s)]
*  how we could do that. So that is a tremendous risk that you could root these robots, right? You could [[00:41:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2511.28s)]
*  have a foreign adversary figure out that there's an entire group of robots that are deployed in this [[00:41:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2517.36s)]
*  country, hack them, root them because they all have to be connected to the internet in some way, [[00:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2522.2400000000002s)]
*  shape or form, and then introduce some instruction set that causes them to be extremely violent. [[00:42:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2527.2s)]
*  That is 100% likely. The question is, do they do it or do we think about it in terms of the way we [[00:42:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2532.48s)]
*  think about nuclear arms where there's a mutually assured destruction so nobody does it? But I think [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2539.2s)]
*  Elon is right. The capability is at hand. And the more we see these humanoid robots manifest, that [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2544.16s)]
*  is probably the single biggest tail risk that it represents. It's very scary, I think. [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2550.56s)]
*  Yeah, it's super interesting. [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2557.04s)]
*  Let me just say this, J. Cal. It starts off, you don't hire the thing when it looks scary and it's [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2559.36s)]
*  hanging on a crane. You buy it because you see articles talking about how this is from a company [[00:42:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2564.32s)]
*  called the robots called protoclone created by clone robotics, because they tell you it's the [[00:42:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2570.88s)]
*  world's first bipedal musculoskeletal android. This is a different company and a different robot, [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2576.32s)]
*  FYI, but it shows it twitching to life and kicking and moving its arms and elbows. [[00:43:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2581.28s)]
*  And what they tell you is it's going to memorize the layout of your home and kitchen inventory, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2585.6000000000004s)]
*  it's going to wash your dishes and clothes, it's going to make sandwiches, it's going to pour [[00:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2588.6400000000003s)]
*  drinks, it's going to set the table, it's going to hold and retrieve items, it's going to vacuum [[00:43:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2591.04s)]
*  clean, shake hands and even talk. So fun. It's like a pet that does all of your domestic chores [[00:43:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2594.1600000000003s)]
*  and all is well and good, J. Cal, until it freaks out like the exhibit A. [[00:43:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2599.52s)]
*  Yeah, it's, he's not being bombastic at all. Probably 15, 20, maybe 20 years ago now. I lived [[00:43:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2603.52s)]
*  in Los Angeles and I had a friend, Sam Harris, we had the same book agent and Sam Harris, [[00:43:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2613.28s)]
*  I introduced him to Elon, the three of us used to go to dinner every other week or so [[00:43:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2618.0s)]
*  at Popone's in Brentwood and we ate some chicken parm and we talked and this was actually what Elon [[00:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2621.84s)]
*  was talking about with Sam a lot. Now they're no longer friends, but they went through one evening [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2627.2s)]
*  we were talking about all the possible ways AI could spiral out of control. Obviously this is [[00:43:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2631.84s)]
*  one of them or something even simpler, which is you got a lot of terrorists out there. Terrorists [[00:43:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2635.84s)]
*  typically are dumb. They, you know, you very rarely have a sophisticated attack like 9-11. Thank God. [[00:44:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2642.1600000000003s)]
*  But imagine terrorists or people with really bad intent having access to these computers and making [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2648.32s)]
*  their version of COVID, which apparently was made in a lab according to the New York Times and the [[00:44:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2654.6400000000003s)]
*  government and everybody and Fauci covered it up. You know, it's conspiracy theories are becoming [[00:44:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2659.76s)]
*  Nobel Peace Prizes like and you know, very quickly these days. Record time. You could, [[00:44:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2665.0400000000004s)]
*  it's unbelievable the time between it being a conspiracy theory and somebody when a Pulitzer is [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2671.1200000000003s)]
*  is getting down to like 36 months now. It's weird, I guess journalists, right? It took like 40 years [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2676.4s)]
*  for the Catholic Church to actually admit that they were, you know, doing horrible things. [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2683.92s)]
*  And even then only sort of. [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2689.2s)]
*  Only sort of admit it and then pay a bunch of settlements, right? 40, four decades instead of [[00:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2691.8399999999997s)]
*  40 months. And imagine like some bad actors decide, you know, let's see if we can put into [[00:44:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2695.4399999999996s)]
*  the large language model, et cetera. How do we make a better COVID or what are great ideas? How [[00:45:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2701.8399999999997s)]
*  do we build nuclear bombs? How do we do this stuff? We've been able to contain that information and [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2705.9199999999996s)]
*  then contain the techniques. These things are going to come up with really, really great ideas. [[00:45:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2710.3199999999997s)]
*  And it used to be law enforcement would read thrillers and science fiction in order to figure [[00:45:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2714.56s)]
*  out what an end terrorist would do this as well, because the science fiction and the authors were [[00:45:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2721.04s)]
*  really good at saying, hey, here's a crazy idea for a terrorist attack because they're trying to [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2725.52s)]
*  get ratings or make a very compelling movie, et cetera. So there have been instances where, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2729.6s)]
*  you know, three letter agencies went to specific science fiction and thriller authors to have them [[00:45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2734.08s)]
*  brainstorm the stuff. This is going to be brainstorming all kinds of bad ideas and putting [[00:45:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2739.7599999999998s)]
*  it in people's heads and we're going to have to figure it out. And Tramot's right. These robots [[00:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2744.08s)]
*  could be rooted very easily, self-driving cars as well. And it's exactly like the situation. [[00:45:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2748.64s)]
*  These two stories parallel each other, the Facebook story of growth at all costs. And don't worry [[00:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2754.56s)]
*  about the outcome because we're in competition with LinkedIn and we're in competition with [[00:45:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2759.12s)]
*  Instagram and Twitter. When you get a bunch of rabbit entrepreneurs globally, you know, [[00:46:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2763.12s)]
*  fighting it out, then what happens is they're like, you know what, we'll move fast and we'll [[00:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2768.0s)]
*  break things. In this case, if you move fast and break things, we could have very bad consequences. [[00:46:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2771.76s)]
*  The people who work at OpenAI joined that company, Elon funded it in order to make sure all of the [[00:46:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2777.28s)]
*  code was open-sourced and that they were thinking about safety and everybody got access to it. So [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2785.36s)]
*  there was parody in the world. Sam Altman in a very selfish act then flipped it to his own personal [[00:46:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2791.0400000000004s)]
*  piggy bank where he would make unlimited amounts of capital from it and made a closed AI. [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2797.44s)]
*  This technology needs to be monitored and you're going to have companies, because they want growth, [[00:46:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2803.76s)]
*  saying, you know what, we'll risk it. We'll risk it. And that's where sensible legislation or [[00:46:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2811.84s)]
*  sensible controls would make sense, at least thoughtfulness about it. And this is why David [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2816.8s)]
*  Sacks, being the czar of AI is so great because he is thinking about these issues. [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2821.36s)]
*  But we don't even have like, the thing that's disturbing with the robots is, [[00:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2826.24s)]
*  I mean, among other things, there's no defense. You know, a lot of us have [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2829.3599999999997s)]
*  guns. Thanks to them being an advertiser on the show. I also have Berna, which is non-lethal [[00:47:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2833.2799999999997s)]
*  self-defense. It's basically like a little chemical weapon and a bullet. So you've got a bunch of [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2838.3199999999997s)]
*  different options available to you. None of that will work on the crazed robot or robots showing [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2842.56s)]
*  up at your door trying to, we have no defense at the moment to these things. And yet we're just [[00:47:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2848.24s)]
*  proceeding. I don't know if it's fair to say blindly Chamath, but like we're proceeding rapidly [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2853.2s)]
*  down the lane of empowering them. Yeah. The problem that we have is that whenever we think [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2858.16s)]
*  about slowing this stuff down, we're faced with the, the scepter of a much bigger risk, which is [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2863.68s)]
*  these are national level security issues. And so now we have to think about us as the United States [[00:47:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2869.04s)]
*  and what do we do versus our frenemies abroad who have their own intentions with these technologies. [[00:47:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2877.2799999999997s)]
*  So, you know, us versus China is probably the best way to explain this. But in that video, [[00:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2883.2s)]
*  your first video, Megan, that was a, you know, a Chinese startup. We have our own versions of [[00:48:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2888.48s)]
*  those Chinese startups. What are we to do if they continue unabated? They look at that video and [[00:48:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2892.8799999999997s)]
*  they say, it is what it is. We'll deal with the consequences of a few deaths here or there. We [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2898.24s)]
*  want this to happen. We want us to be the first country that has them. And then like belt and [[00:48:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2902.48s)]
*  road, we will put our robots all over the world. Like, could you imagine if there's a class of [[00:48:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2907.6s)]
*  these robots that can enable productivity and GDP growth? And instead of financing roads and waterways [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2913.2799999999997s)]
*  in Africa or in Asia, China just shows up with just boatloads and boatloads of these robots to [[00:48:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2922.16s)]
*  do the work for folks and then just uplift entire societies. Imagine how much political and economic [[00:48:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2928.0s)]
*  leverage they get. So when you paint it in that lens, you're in this very difficult situation, [[00:48:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2933.36s)]
*  which is how do we slow people down here? And that's just a very hard thing to do. So I think that [[00:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2939.6800000000003s)]
*  we have to find a way of going fast, embracing a handful of companies who we know has leadership [[00:49:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2944.5600000000004s)]
*  we can trust. But otherwise, if we slow down, we're going to lose a much bigger race. And I [[00:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2950.4s)]
*  think that has much bigger consequences. I wonder if it's like the Manhattan Project, [[00:49:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2955.36s)]
*  Jamath, if we need to just put every ounce of energy into winning this AI race for general, [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2958.56s)]
*  you know, computer. I really think it's like that. Because I think if we lose the GDP war, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2965.92s)]
*  we're going to lose all the wars. Because if you don't have technical supremacy, we will lose [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2971.6s)]
*  military supremacy, and we will lose economic supremacy. And then I don't know what America [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2976.48s)]
*  does if we're second in the pecking order on anything. That's not something we've had to deal [[00:49:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2982.96s)]
*  with in the last 100 years. Yeah, we don't want to be on the receiving end of an army of Chinese [[00:49:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2988.24s)]
*  controlled robots like that one that was hanging from the mini crane or just stand by. We're just [[00:49:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2993.68s)]
*  orders. We're coming right back. J Cal and Jamath stay with us for the full show. Guests from the [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=2998.3199999999997s)]

*  biggest casualties are digestion. Millions of people suffer with indigestion, bloating, [[00:50:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3020.72s)]
*  and upset stomach. But here's the good news. We don't have to just accept this. Our ancestors [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3026.72s)]

*  courtesy of the US Supreme Court late yesterday, which ruled six to three his ban on trans people [[00:51:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3082.32s)]
*  serving in the armed services can go forward, will remain in place while the litigation plays [[00:51:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3089.28s)]
*  out on the merits. So it's not the final final, because there'll be a trial or there'll be a [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3096.1600000000003s)]
*  ruling, etc. But right now, that's a good thing, because what had happened was he's got a bunch of [[00:51:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3101.36s)]
*  cases out there suing him for this executive order. The two most prominent came out of DC [[00:51:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3106.32s)]
*  and the Seattle area. And those trial court judges both said this ban has got to go. It's [[00:51:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3111.6800000000003s)]
*  riddled with animus. This is the one where the DC trial judge at federal court was like, [[00:51:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3117.92s)]
*  it reeks of animus and hatred and it's unsupported by anything. And it's absolutely biased and awful. [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3122.6400000000003s)]
*  And I'm throwing it out. And actually, the DC circuit court of appeals above her reversed her. [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3128.72s)]
*  So Trump was winning that one. But then another case bubbled up over in the ninth circuit, [[00:52:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3133.68s)]
*  first at the trial court level in the Seattle area. And that judge who was a George W. Bush [[00:52:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3138.48s)]
*  appointed judge, wasn't as nasty about it, but also said it's got to go. I'm not going to let [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3142.56s)]
*  the ban stay in place while the litigation plays out because I do not see a likelihood of success [[00:52:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3147.7599999999998s)]
*  on the merits for the Trump administration. And the ninth circuit court of appeals, very, very [[00:52:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3151.44s)]
*  leftist court agreed with him. And that's the case that Trump appealed to the US Supreme Court. [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3155.68s)]
*  And the US Supreme Court just said, wrong, wrong. Ninth circuit. This case can go forward [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3160.08s)]
*  and at the Seattle court and frankly over at the DC court, but the ban will be in place as it does. [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3165.8399999999997s)]
*  And this is driving the left insane. I mean, in some cases it appears even literally here's [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3173.7599999999998s)]
*  a woman from on TikTok. I don't know where we got this, but I'll tell you and as soon as I get the [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3182.0s)]
*  attribution, but here's her challenge. Sat 10. I have a proposition. Okay. If one person, [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3188.32s)]
*  one person can come in the comments and tell me what is so scary about transgender people, [[00:53:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3194.96s)]
*  I'll shave my head, but it has to be a valid reason. Okay. And I'll give you an example of [[00:53:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3200.08s)]
*  a valid reason. I think you could ban bears from the military. Okay. And I would say [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3206.0s)]
*  banning bears from the military would make a lot of sense. Let me tell you why bears are dangerous. [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3214.24s)]
*  Bears don't know if, you know, the person on their side or the person on the other side is the person [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3219.92s)]
*  they're supposed to be eating. Okay. So they could eat you, your fellow servicemen has to be factual. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3225.76s)]
*  It has to be, I am scared of a bear because a bear can eat me. I am scared of a transgender person [[00:53:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3231.12s)]
*  because I don't know if they have a penis under their skirt. Like what is it? Don't even try to [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3237.92s)]
*  come up here being like a lot of attacks from transgender people onto other people, because [[00:54:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3242.0s)]
*  the facts are, that's actually just not true. The facts are white men are still the number one attackers [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3248.88s)]
*  of women. Okay. So back to the, this is to be sure that we understand white men are always the threat, [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3253.52s)]
*  but I have an answer for her. By the way, it was Libs of TikTok that found that and posted it. [[00:54:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3261.76s)]
*  Transgenderism, gender dysphoria is in the DSM-5 as a mental disorder. That's all you need to be [[00:54:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3266.16s)]
*  disqualified from serving in the military. Things you can be ejected from the military for, or not [[00:54:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3274.0s)]
*  allowed in, in the first place, a history of anxiety, ADD, a history of any eating disorder, [[00:54:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3279.76s)]
*  a history of depression. I mean, it's not hard to get banned from the military at all. And so gender [[00:54:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3287.84s)]
*  dysphoria, which actually does appear in the DSM-5 as a disorder is more than enough to qualify. So [[00:54:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3295.0400000000004s)]
*  the ban was correct. It depends on the commander in chief or what he thinks is appropriate. This [[00:55:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3303.28s)]
*  commander in chief says it's a no, but this is causing a lot of consternation. And it leads me [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3307.36s)]
*  to my question to you guys, which is how likely does this make it that JB Pritzker, the governor [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3313.28s)]
*  of Illinois, and probably the most trans politician in the country emerges as the Democrats great white [[00:55:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3320.88s)]
*  hope because his whole family has put more funding into transing children, making sure that trans [[00:55:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3329.28s)]
*  ideology gets into our schools and supported, funneled down in a way that's very, very dangerous [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3335.68s)]
*  than anybody else. And this guy, while the rest of the Democrat party seems to have taken a bit of a [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3342.8799999999997s)]
*  lesson, they may not be willing to totally embrace it, but they've heard a little, at least on boys [[00:55:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3347.9199999999996s)]
*  and girls sports, that they're on thin ice. This guy's doubling and tripling down on pushing boys [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3352.08s)]
*  into girls sports, on getting trans kids all the quote help they need with the surgeries, [[00:55:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3357.3599999999997s)]
*  to the point where he's being celebrated in the Washington Post today as the future of the [[00:56:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3362.3199999999997s)]
*  Dem Party, notwithstanding the fact that they're supposedly anti-billionaire. Who would like to take that one? [[00:56:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3366.7999999999997s)]
*  Well, I think what I would say on the first topic is if folks disagree with this, [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3373.68s)]
*  I think what they should probably do is invest the resources to influence the powers that be to [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3382.16s)]
*  redefine gender dysphoria as something that shouldn't be in the DSN-5. And then they would [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3388.24s)]
*  have a more straightforward discrimination case probably. What I see is actually pretty healthy [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3393.7599999999998s)]
*  form of government, which is you have decisions that are being made by the executive branch. So [[00:56:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3400.3999999999996s)]
*  Trump is exercising his executive authority. Citizens and other groups who disagree with it, [[00:56:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3405.6s)]
*  they bring it to a court of law. Decision goes one way or the other. Either party can escalate. [[00:56:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3411.9199999999996s)]
*  And there's a due process that's happening. I think that that's my sort of view on that issue. [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3417.92s)]
*  But it's a microcosm of something that I think Trump does that people still don't seem to get, [[00:57:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3424.8s)]
*  which is that he has this innate ability to shape the contours of potholes. And people fall into [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3429.52s)]
*  these potholes and that they get obsessed around issues that are fundamentally, you know, small [[00:57:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3435.6800000000003s)]
*  numbers of people are affected by them. And I think in that what happens is there's just a lot [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3442.48s)]
*  of energy that's expended. And instead, what I think people should really be doing, and I think [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3448.16s)]
*  this is really what the Democrats should be doing, is kind of like upleveling this to what are the [[00:57:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3453.76s)]
*  issues that affect the 79 million people that will need to vote for them if they're going to win in [[00:57:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3457.52s)]
*  2028. If you define the problem that way, you'd have a different surface area of things that matter, [[00:57:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3463.6s)]
*  where you'd expend legal resources and money. And I don't think that they've done that yet. [[00:57:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3469.36s)]
*  So to the extent that JB is just working on vibes, and he's listening to the echo chamber [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3474.48s)]
*  of people that say that these are important issues, they are to a small cohort, but it [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3480.48s)]
*  misses the bigger point, which is they are not the issues that will define how 80 million people will [[00:58:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3485.2000000000003s)]
*  vote Democrat in four years. But they can't. They're obsessed with identity. And that goes [[00:58:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3490.0s)]
*  beyond the subset of people who are affected by gender dysphoria. The left, and in particular, [[00:58:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3496.88s)]
*  the left wing of the Democrat Party is obsessed with identity. They can't let it go. [[00:58:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3502.08s)]
*  It's an effective mechanic to exploit the innate sense of something is wrong that some people have, [[00:58:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3510.88s)]
*  right? For whatever reason, those folks have not maybe achieved what they wanted to achieve. [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3518.88s)]
*  They haven't exceeded the expectations that they had of themselves. Maybe their parents are doing [[00:58:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3524.24s)]
*  better than them. They probably can't afford a home that they thought they would buy. Maybe [[00:58:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3528.48s)]
*  they're still under school debt. All of these things create this situation where there's an [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3532.64s)]
*  innate sense of, in their language, inequality, inequity, frustration. And they're able to project [[00:58:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3538.24s)]
*  that the smart left wing politicians, and I give them credit for this, are able to take that channel [[00:59:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3547.6s)]
*  and project them on a different set of issues that they can control. And that narrative allows [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3554.0s)]
*  them to organize people, to fundraise, etc. And so I think that people need to just understand [[00:59:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3558.32s)]
*  that that's the mechanic that's going on. That's happened for decades on a whole host of issues, [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3564.0s)]
*  not just by the left, but also by the right. And I think that right now we are in that cycle. [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3568.8s)]
*  And in order to break it, you have to have a politician, a Bill Clinton type politician [[00:59:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3574.0s)]
*  on the left, who says, hold on a sec, guys, here are the broad based issues that affect [[00:59:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3579.28s)]
*  80, 90 million Americans, and I'm going to try to get, you know, three quarters of them to vote for [[00:59:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3585.92s)]
*  me. And that is not that is not even close to happening right now in the Democratic Party. [[00:59:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3590.5600000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I'm just a build on Jamad's comments. It is virtuous to think about, are there any people who [[00:59:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3594.88s)]
*  are being oppressed in the world? And can we reduce their suffering? We had the civil rights [[01:00:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3601.52s)]
*  movement here, we can look at incarceration in our country and people being put in jail, [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3604.96s)]
*  who were innocent, you know, the Innocence Project, and, you know, we did DNA testing to [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3609.92s)]
*  get some people, you know, who were incorrectly put in jail released. And every generation wants [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3614.2400000000002s)]
*  to fight for that. I think that picking the trans issue was a big mistake, because as you framed it [[01:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3620.48s)]
*  correctly, MK, the issue is a psychological disorder. And then it might be a lifestyle [[01:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3626.0s)]
*  choice for adults. But the Democrats, and you know, some people I remember when I was in Los [[01:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3632.48s)]
*  Angeles, it was kind of like a cause celeb to have a trans kid, oh my god, you were so proud of them. [[01:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3638.32s)]
*  And you became the most popular person, you know, at crossroads or whatever school it was in LA, [[01:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3643.36s)]
*  because you were championing this people want to champion injustice, I get it. But this is an issue [[01:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3648.64s)]
*  that we're if somebody is a child, and they want to change genders, that has to be dealt with quietly [[01:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3654.56s)]
*  with compassion with psychologists and doctors really thinking it through under no circumstances [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3659.68s)]
*  should irreversible surgery be given to children. And this is where, you know, the Republicans seized [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3665.3599999999997s)]
*  on a very stupid position that the Democrats decided they would make one of their core issues. [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3671.8399999999997s)]
*  And they spent over $150 million, according to these reports on that one ad that says Kamala is [[01:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3678.8799999999997s)]
*  for they them Trump is for you. They absolutely overplayed that hand and didn't realize that women [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3685.68s)]
*  and Democrats, they didn't want children to have, you know, their bodies mutilated or be taking [[01:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3692.72s)]
*  irreversible hormones. And the actual concept of doing that now people are looking at going, Whoa, [[01:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3699.12s)]
*  we have to actually ban that. And it and that's, I think, one of the social issues where Chamath [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3705.68s)]
*  right, you need to level it up and just say, Hey, this is something that should be done personally [[01:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3711.6s)]
*  with a family, if you have a child suffering from this, and if an adult is suffering from it, great, [[01:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3716.24s)]
*  but we have to take this off the national stage as an important issue. When we have really important [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3719.92s)]
*  issues, like, you know, she AI, by the way, here's a here's so many more important issues to really [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3724.24s)]
*  bring to the table here. Here's another weaponizing it. Here's another pothole issue that I think [[01:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3732.88s)]
*  Trump, President Trump created that the left and the mainstream media fell into, but [[01:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3737.84s)]
*  the due process issues of a handful one or two illegal aliens that have been deported. [[01:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3743.6000000000004s)]
*  And the reason I say that is, Jason mentioned the Innocence Project, I actually looked this up last [[01:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3751.84s)]
*  week. And there are hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of cases a year that the Southern Poverty [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3757.0400000000004s)]
*  Law Center and the Innocence Project take up about due process issues of actual American citizens. [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3762.64s)]
*  And you know how much attention that's gotten zero, not one second on the national stage. Instead, [[01:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3769.3599999999997s)]
*  we're debating this one El Salvadorian who's already committed crimes, came as an illegal, [[01:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3774.64s)]
*  committed crimes as an illegal was supposed to get sent back. And we are obsessed or we are supposed [[01:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3779.2799999999997s)]
*  to be obsessed about his due process rights. When there are actively 600 cases at any given time [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3783.92s)]
*  that the Innocence Project is taking up about actual Americans and their due process. [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3789.92s)]
*  And so you wonder, why does that happen? And I think it happens because again, [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3794.4s)]
*  there is this innate sense that whatever people whatever's happening in someone's life is just not [[01:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3799.44s)]
*  working out the way that they thought. And other people are able to frankly, just exploit that [[01:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3804.4s)]
*  and channel it. The problem is they're channeling it at fringe issues. And when most people have, [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3811.52s)]
*  you know, wake up, they're like, Excuse me, like, don't you have any common sense? Those are not [[01:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3817.76s)]
*  the issues of all of us. Well, I think there's no better example of what you're saying than [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3821.92s)]
*  than what happened with BLM and taking officer involved shootings of unarmed black men, and [[01:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3827.6000000000004s)]
*  elevating that to the big issue affecting the black community in America, as opposed to having [[01:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3834.6400000000003s)]
*  any willingness to take an honest look at what's happening on the south side of Chicago, [[01:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3841.44s)]
*  no interest whatsoever at the number of deaths that occur there, a place I've been a place I've [[01:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3846.08s)]
*  interviewed moms who have lost their boys to repeat violence and over and over. But it's, [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3851.92s)]
*  it's all to me based in the left's obsession with identity. And if it were so easy to just [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3857.44s)]
*  excise that piece of the party, and have the normies in the Democrat Party move forward, [[01:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3862.48s)]
*  we could have a normal political contest again in the future. And this well this summit that [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3867.2s)]
*  they're having today with your pal Ezra Klein, who I know Chamath had a debate with on your podcast, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3870.96s)]
*  he's featured the Democrats decided to bring up on aisle three, clean up on aisle three, [[01:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3876.24s)]
*  guys are hosting him. I'll show a soundbite of it as their retreat special guest to try to help them [[01:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3881.36s)]
*  understand how to win again. Ezra Klein cannot talk identity obsession out of his party. It is [[01:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3889.12s)]
*  a pernicious pancreatic level for cancer that they they can't take out and they can't live [[01:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3897.12s)]
*  without the liver. Go ahead, Jake. Well, I was just gonna say just to sort of steal [[01:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3903.76s)]
*  me in a little bit Trump, I know you guys both have TDS Trump dedication syndrome. [[01:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3908.0800000000004s)]
*  So I'm just going to give you the other side of it, which is you deny you have dedication system, [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3912.4s)]
*  we'll get into it. But Trump is spectacular at triggering people and saying outlandish things, [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3917.6000000000004s)]
*  like we're going to reopen Alcatraz, and we're going to send citizens to another population. [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3923.92s)]
*  He does this to rile people up and it is divisive. And it is also a mistake. And it's one of the [[01:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3930.2400000000002s)]
*  reasons why Americans hate each other. And we have this massive conflict in the country, [[01:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3936.96s)]
*  we can't focus on real issues. Trump is an equal part in this dysfunctional disaster. [[01:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3940.6400000000003s)]
*  By telling people, we're going to send people to see cot like a really sadistic, [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3946.1600000000003s)]
*  terrible prison without due process. Every human being in the United States, whether they're [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3951.76s)]
*  illegal or not deserve some amount of due process. And by just sending people there, [[01:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3956.96s)]
*  if you send 200 people, you're going to make a 1% or 2% error rate, it's just going to happen. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3962.2400000000002s)]
*  I come from a law enforcement family, I know all about this mistakes happen. It would have [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3967.92s)]
*  cost Trump nothing to instead of making these grant, you know, feeding his base with we're [[01:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3971.84s)]
*  going to send people to the most sadistic, horrible prison and sending people to stand [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3977.28s)]
*  in front of the cages where they keep people and they have no mattresses and they get to go outside [[01:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3980.7200000000003s)]
*  for 30 minutes a day. This is torturous conditions. Instead of doing disgusting stuff like that, [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3985.44s)]
*  they could have just said, Hey, we're going to send everybody to get Mo for about 30 days [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3989.84s)]
*  as a way station and make sure we get our facts correct and make sure we don't actually pick up [[01:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3993.6s)]
*  an American. Something tells me sending them to get Mo would not have appeased Trump's critics. [[01:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=3998.7200000000003s)]
*  Just the word get Mo is a massive trigger. It is a trigger. It is used. Gitmo is used [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4004.4s)]
*  for a way station as a as a neutral place to send people and that would have actually been [[01:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4012.32s)]
*  a little bit you believe in no due process. You think these people should just get sent to that [[01:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4017.36s)]
*  prison covered the Supreme Court and the courts for Fox during all those years where Gitmo was [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4021.04s)]
*  front and center in the news. Let me assure you, this would not have appeased the left in any way, [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4026.0s)]
*  shape or form. What about you, Megan? Do you think people should be picked up from the streets and [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4030.88s)]
*  sent to see God? Do you think they should have due process? Yes or no? I think they had due [[01:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4034.96s)]
*  process. These people who are getting shoved out to see God have been deported already. They've [[01:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4039.28s)]
*  gotten their due process. You think there's a possibility we'll make a mistake? I mean, [[01:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4042.6400000000003s)]
*  I guess so, but I'm really more focused on the mistakes that Joe Biden made that got [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4047.0400000000004s)]
*  Laken Reilly killed that got Jocelyn Nungare killed. Like that's what matters to me. Like I [[01:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4050.7200000000003s)]
*  frankly think it's your person. Yeah, I got it. No, I think what she's saying is compassion is [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4055.44s)]
*  a two way street. It applies to everybody. It applies to the victims of the people that have [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4061.6000000000004s)]
*  been hurt. Of course. And that's why just a modicum of due process. What would the harm be? [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4064.8s)]
*  And then what's the harm of saying, Hey, if we did make a mistake, let's take a look. [[01:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4069.76s)]
*  They've got a process. Yeah. Like a break. Garcia was deported. He had an order of removal. [[01:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4072.88s)]
*  It was just, he wasn't supposed to go to El Salvador, but the guys totally removable. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4078.5600000000004s)]
*  Okay. So we did make a mistake. Okay. So we made a mistake. They originally said it was a mistake. [[01:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4081.6800000000003s)]
*  The Trump administration said that. Then they turfed that lawyer who admitted that in court. [[01:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4086.32s)]
*  But listen, here's the thing. Well, by the way, there's a report right now in the news [[01:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4091.36s)]
*  that they allegedly shipped eight women to see cot and then said, Oh, you know what? That was [[01:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4094.4s)]
*  a mistake and sent them back. So I don't think we can take the position that the Trump administration [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4099.52s)]
*  would have made nine mistakes out of two. So that's four, 4%, 5% of what they go through. [[01:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4103.52s)]
*  Like Jason, I just interviewed Tulsi last week. I asked her, what do they go through? Like why [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4108.64s)]
*  should we trust the process? You tell me it's not, Oh, brown man, he's out of here. Um, it's, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4112.96s)]
*  and wearing a Chicago bulls sweatshirt. This is what the left would have you believe. They go [[01:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4118.72s)]
*  to the DEA. There's nobody in the country who better knows who gang members are than the DEA [[01:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4122.56s)]
*  that spends its days immersed in them up to the neck, trying to figure out who's selling drugs [[01:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4126.72s)]
*  to whom and for whom. And then they run it by the FBI, which has open case files. If we have a 4 or [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4131.120000000001s)]
*  5% error rate, that's too high. You just explained a 4% error rate. So it's like you're damned if [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4135.84s)]
*  you do and you're damned if you don't see that. I'm just saying there are errors that they rectify [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4141.6s)]
*  this by the way, is what the Trump administration is worried about. Then it's like you have too high [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4146.080000000001s)]
*  error rate. But if you, if you don't get pretty darn high, then that's what happened to if we [[01:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4150.48s)]
*  could actually take this much, if we could take this much energy and actually focus it on us [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4156.0s)]
*  citizens and the problems of us citizens, we would be, uh, in an incredibly great place. [[01:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4160.24s)]
*  And the problem is we're going to wind up making mistakes with us citizens. It's bound to happen. [[01:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4165.839999999999s)]
*  So I respectfully think we should just do a little bit more. If they have a 4% error rate, [[01:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4169.759999999999s)]
*  try to get to 1%. I would love for you to care even one inch more about a US citizen. [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4175.2s)]
*  Of course I do. I care about all citizens. You know, my position on human rights, [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4181.84s)]
*  I believe in the universal declaration of human rights, whether it's, you know, the Uighurs in [[01:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4185.12s)]
*  China, people being exported, everybody should have some due process and there should be [[01:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4190.24s)]
*  compassionate. We shouldn't be able to put people in prisons like this. What is the name of the [[01:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4195.04s)]
*  El Salvadoran who we sent to El Salvador, despite the fact that he wasn't supposed to be deported [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4199.84s)]
*  there? Oh, we don't need to get into like a quiz if I know everybody's name. We have nine people [[01:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4204.32s)]
*  who were sent. I don't off the top of my head. I mean, I've read five articles about it, but [[01:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4209.84s)]
*  I'll give you, I'll give you a multiple choice. Is it, um, Mr. Hernandez, Mr. Fernandez or Mr. [[01:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4215.84s)]
*  Abrego Garcia? I think it's the third one, but I don't remember. I've read two or three stories on [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4221.28s)]
*  it. Yeah, I'm pretty sure it's the third one. And what is the name of the young mother of five who [[01:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4227.04s)]
*  was brutally murdered by an illegal in the same state of Maryland? I don't have all this committed [[01:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4231.68s)]
*  to memory. I mean, I read tons of stories. Megan, this is, this is a silly argument. No, you're [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4236.240000000001s)]
*  trying to, I mean, no, no, you're trying to belittle my opinion. My opinion actually is a valid one, [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4242.64s)]
*  Megan. I take offense to you trying to play quiz game with me. The most important thing is human [[01:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4247.92s)]
*  rights and human rights matters and we should apply them equally even to, well, I just want to finish my sentence. [[01:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4252.72s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is a name, no, I was making a point and you took the feel from me. I'm taking it back. [[01:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4258.72s)]
*  Abrego Garcia is a name known by virtually every American right now. There are polls on him. [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4263.280000000001s)]
*  Virtually every American knows that name because it's been all over the media. Almost nobody knows [[01:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4268.0s)]
*  the name Rachel Moran, which is the name of the mother who had five children who was brutally [[01:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4271.92s)]
*  murdered by an illegal. Did Chris Van Hollen, the Senator from Maryland, go to her family, [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4276.8s)]
*  go to her funeral, provide comfort to her mother? No, it's a no. Nobody even knew her name until the [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4281.280000000001s)]
*  mother was forced in front of the White House press corps by the Trump administration, which gave [[01:11:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4287.84s)]
*  her the opportunity to speak about her daughter's disgusting murder. And she begged people to focus [[01:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4291.360000000001s)]
*  not on due process for these illegals, but what they're doing to us. What's happening to young [[01:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4295.360000000001s)]
*  mothers like Rachel, who had no chance against this guy who beat her so brutally. There was an [[01:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4300.24s)]
*  outline of blood against the wall that he raped her on. It's just, this is the problem. It's the [[01:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4304.8s)]
*  problem that Chamath is trying to outline for you that we spend all this energy on the guy having [[01:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4310.400000000001s)]
*  margaritas with Chris Van Hollen and not even one one hundredth pointing out the Americans that [[01:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4315.6s)]
*  they've hurt, which is an important part of the calculus. It's the reason we need to get them out. [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4320.88s)]
*  We need to get them out fast. And people like me and maybe Chamath have almost no sympathy for [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4326.56s)]
*  their due process claims. I would like to say something as well, which is that I think that [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4331.280000000001s)]
*  what we have lacked is the courage to prioritize. And there is a hierarchy of ideas that matter. [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4336.0s)]
*  And I think that we've not been allowed to say that for a long time. But in that hierarchy, [[01:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4342.56s)]
*  what we need to realize is that the single most important thing that dictates the long term [[01:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4346.8s)]
*  security and success of the United States is one thing, which is the technological supremacy of [[01:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4352.0s)]
*  America. If we lose it, we lose everything else. But if you have it, all of a sudden you're in a [[01:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4357.76s)]
*  position to have economic supremacy and military supremacy. If you have economic supremacy, [[01:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4362.56s)]
*  all of a sudden you have the ability to do a lot of things for American citizens. [[01:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4368.240000000001s)]
*  And also for people abroad, because we think it's the morally and ethically right thing to do. [[01:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4372.400000000001s)]
*  But if you can't get your priorities straight, and everything matters, and everything gets [[01:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4377.04s)]
*  devolved into a two minute sound bite, and we lose the plot, we are going to lose. And that's [[01:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4381.360000000001s)]
*  been difficult to say, because it seems like you come off as like some callous, unemotional person. [[01:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4387.68s)]
*  And it's not about that. It's about having the courage to understand that leadership takes [[01:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4392.08s)]
*  prioritization. And what I see right now is that the things that matter are being prioritized. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4396.88s)]
*  I'll give you but one example. Three weeks ago, the Chinese government sent a memo [[01:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4402.96s)]
*  to the government of South Korea that said, these rare earths that we send you, [[01:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4409.36s)]
*  you cannot send into the US military supply chain. If you do, there'll be consequences. [[01:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4414.400000000001s)]
*  Do you understand the implication of that? How important that is? China also controls the [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4419.84s)]
*  overwhelming majority of our pharmaceutical API inputs. China is also at the forefront of all of [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4424.96s)]
*  this AI stuff that we're talking about. China is the only one that can make the critical technologies [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4429.44s)]
*  for batteries that we use for everything. If we can't just understand that these things are the [[01:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4433.52s)]
*  things that matter, and underneath, it's messy, government is messy, there will be some mistakes. [[01:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4439.6s)]
*  And as long as there's some reasonable way, you got to get the high order bit right. The high order [[01:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4445.6s)]
*  bit on which Trump was elected on that specific issue is there are a lot of people that are here [[01:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4450.4s)]
*  that should not be here. And 80 million people said those folks should be sent back. And I think you [[01:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4455.839999999999s)]
*  have to honor that. And you have to have the ability, one second, you have to have the ability [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4463.839999999999s)]
*  then to go and honor all of these other things that are important. And I would just wish that [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4468.5599999999995s)]
*  the media, instead of fanning the flames around one person in CICOT or this or that, would actually [[01:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4473.759999999999s)]
*  narrowly allow America to understand the arc of what really matters. I'll give you another example [[01:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4480.32s)]
*  of what really matters. It turned out that we borrowed $51 billion less than we thought [[01:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4486.4s)]
*  last month. You know how consequentially important that is? [[01:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4496.08s)]
*  Thanks to Doge. [[01:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4500.4s)]
*  Thanks to Doge. But except what do we see? We see Doge get vilified, we see Elon Musk get vilified. [[01:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4501.92s)]
*  In the same breath by the same people that then all of a sudden make this one person [[01:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4508.32s)]
*  the center of attention. And this is where there needs to be some amount of common sense and [[01:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4513.44s)]
*  prioritization because these issues are hard. I get it. There'll be some mistakes that are made. [[01:15:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4517.92s)]
*  But this is where courage is defined. Have the ability to say what really matters, create a [[01:15:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4524.639999999999s)]
*  hierarchy, focus on those things and fix those things that make the lives of most Americans [[01:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4529.92s)]
*  better. And then worry about the edge cases. [[01:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4535.2s)]
*  Go ahead. [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4539.2s)]
*  No, we all agree that the border should be secured and we shouldn't let criminals into [[01:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4541.28s)]
*  the country and that criminals should be dealt with. You know, my position on it is human rights [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4546.88s)]
*  matter. And maybe that makes me old school. But I think, you know, Americans and immigrants should [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4552.4s)]
*  all be treated with the same due process and with the same care and how yeah, I kind of do actually. [[01:15:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4558.72s)]
*  Deportations? [[01:16:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4565.2s)]
*  I think they should have proper due process and I think people should be treated compassionately. [[01:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4567.4400000000005s)]
*  This is a nation that was built by immigrants. Chamath is an immigrant to this country. [[01:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4572.72s)]
*  Freiburg, Elon and David Sacks. All my besties are immigrants to this country. We should treat [[01:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4577.04s)]
*  immigrants really well and we should encourage immigration. I have nothing to complain about. [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4582.08s)]
*  They're killing our citizens. They're literally raping our little girls. Get out. [[01:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4586.88s)]
*  There are immigrants. Yes, of course. And we have a legal system for that. My point is, [[01:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4591.44s)]
*  there is a sadistic nature to how this is being done that I disagree with. And I believe how you [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4597.2s)]
*  treat people who have the least amount of power, whether it's poor people or immigrants, matters. [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4602.24s)]
*  And I think we should hold ourselves to a very high human rights standard. We wrote the universal [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4608.4s)]
*  declaration of human rights. Eleanor Roosevelt wrote it. The UN approved it. [[01:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4613.599999999999s)]
*  Okay, but let me ask you this. [[01:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4617.919999999999s)]
*  We don't hit all the notes on it, but we should aspire to get all the notes on it. [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4619.52s)]
*  How can we possibly do that for 10 million illegals? How can we possibly do that? [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4623.360000000001s)]
*  Oh, the overwhelming number of them are incredible contributors to our society, [[01:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4626.8s)]
*  like Chamath Palihapitiya. Even the illegal ones. [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4630.96s)]
*  Chamath is not an illegal. [[01:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4634.96s)]
*  No, I'm adding. Even the illegal ones. I know you did. I said even the illegal ones. [[01:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4637.200000000001s)]
*  How do you provide your kind of due process for 10 million illegals? [[01:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4644.24s)]
*  You cannot. You cannot do it for 10 million. But the overwhelming number of them are working hard [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4652.08s)]
*  in restaurants, in homes. Okay, but J. Cal, that decision has been made. I realize you disagree [[01:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4657.919999999999s)]
*  with it. Okay, you disagree. You want them to be able to stay. Trump's on pace to deport 2,000 people [[01:17:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4662.879999999999s)]
*  a week. But let me give you the floor. Trump has said they're going and the American populace wants [[01:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4668.48s)]
*  them gone. The polls show that the majority of Americans wants all of them, not just the criminals, [[01:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4672.88s)]
*  all of them. 56% was the last number. So to those Americans who said I want them gone and I voted [[01:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4677.52s)]
*  for the president who said he'll get rid of them. How would you say, okay, we got to do it because [[01:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4683.36s)]
*  that's what people want. But me, J. Cal, I say they have to get some measure of due process. So how are [[01:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4688.0s)]
*  you going to give it to 10 million people before you deport them? It's such a good question, Megan. [[01:18:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4693.2s)]
*  So first of all, illegal immigrants in this country statistically do less crime than Americans [[01:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4696.88s)]
*  because they're on their best behavior because they know that deportations can occur. That's fact [[01:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4701.6s)]
*  number one. Fact number two, Trump is deporting about 2,000 people a week, maybe 3,000. He's on [[01:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4706.160000000001s)]
*  pace to deport maybe a half million people in his presidency. It was a lie. It was a political lie [[01:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4712.64s)]
*  that he would deport 20 million. That is a Steve Bannon lie to get elected. This is a country built [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4718.56s)]
*  by him. You can't say he's not trying. No, he literally lied and did that to get votes from the [[01:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4724.64s)]
*  base and to get the base to come out. We all know that. You put that all on Trump? You don't think [[01:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4729.12s)]
*  the ACLU had a role in slowing down the numbers? Listen, the point is Trump says a lot of things [[01:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4732.72s)]
*  and he says bombastic, exaggerated things. One of the things he said he would recruit the... Hold on, [[01:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4738.5599999999995s)]
*  let me finish. He said, you want to let me finish? I'll give it to you. The ACLU sued and shut down [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4743.04s)]
*  the alien enemies act. Go ahead. Sorry. Number one, he said we would end the war in Ukraine in one [[01:19:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4746.08s)]
*  day. We all know that he says stuff like that. He said he would deport 20 million people. Steven [[01:19:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4751.44s)]
*  Miller said at the rally in Madison Square Garden, America is for Americans and Americans only. [[01:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4755.68s)]
*  We're deporting all 20 million. Steve Bannon said on the all in pockets, we are absolutely deporting [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4760.400000000001s)]
*  all 20 million. It is not true. Trump says things that are not true to win votes or to get attention, [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4764.96s)]
*  just like any other politician. They all do it. So the truth is he will deport 500,000 to a million [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4770.320000000001s)]
*  people. And if we deported all 10 or 20 million, whatever the real number is, our economy would [[01:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4776.0s)]
*  collapse. It would be absolute economic destruction for the country. We are vilifying [[01:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4781.68s)]
*  Americans. We are vilifying immigrants who are coming to America to work hard to do the jobs [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4787.68s)]
*  Americans don't want to do at a time when we have the lowest unemployment. Of course there is, [[01:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4793.4400000000005s)]
*  but we have to deal with 10 million people here. And if 9.5 million of them are great citizens who [[01:19:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4798.4800000000005s)]
*  are working hard, give them a path, charge them a fine. They're not citizens. Give them a path. [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4804.0s)]
*  It's so unfair that they get to jump the line in front of people who actually are going through [[01:20:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4809.28s)]
*  the loops. It is unfair. But we as Americans let them in. It is unfair, but we let them in. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4813.2s)]
*  We did not do anything. Joe Biden let them in. That is not true. Some of us were jumping up and [[01:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4817.12s)]
*  down for all four years of Biden and all eight years of Obama saying this is deeply wrong and [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4822.16s)]
*  dangerous. We did nothing. Republicans wanted open borders in NAFTA. They wanted Mexicans to be able [[01:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4827.679999999999s)]
*  to cross the border free. Republicans used to be on the wrong side of this. Yes. So if we as Americans, [[01:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4833.84s)]
*  Republicans, hold on. If Republicans and Democrats let these people come into the country, [[01:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4839.04s)]
*  give them a path. The horse is dead and begging for you to stop beating it. Okay, let's move on. [[01:20:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4843.12s)]
*  Because here's, do you agree with that, Shamath, that if we actually managed to get rid of 10 [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4848.160000000001s)]
*  million illegals, the economy would collapse? Yeah, I don't think that that's a reasonable [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4851.360000000001s)]
*  outcome. I don't think that that's economically viable. But the reality is that there is a [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4856.400000000001s)]
*  number of people between zero and 10 million that may not be the best suited to be in the United [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4862.8s)]
*  States for a whole host of reasons. I think that there was a bunch of reporting that, you know, [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4872.0s)]
*  when we think about, especially in the last few years, a lot of these illegals weren't from [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4877.28s)]
*  Central and Southern America. In fact, they were coming from all parts of Asia. They're coming from [[01:21:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4882.16s)]
*  various countries that weren't necessarily, you know, great fans and supporters of the United [[01:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4886.56s)]
*  States. There's still an inherent risk that, you know, we have like a lot of latent risk in, [[01:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4891.04s)]
*  especially the last few years of folks that came across the border, there needs to be a way to find [[01:21:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4896.32s)]
*  that out, assess that risk and deal with them. I think it's naive to think that everybody's just [[01:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4900.88s)]
*  kind of, you know, economically productively adding to the fabric of the United States. [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4906.24s)]
*  And I think that that creates a risk that the United States government is in, [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4911.5199999999995s)]
*  is, is has the right and has been given the authority to figure out. So they should go and [[01:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4915.04s)]
*  figure that out. Meanwhile, let me say, let me say this one thing in support of J. Cal's argument. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4920.64s)]
*  If Trump really wanted these people gone, he would institute e-verify. And he would make sure that [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4926.400000000001s)]
*  employers cannot pay these people, because you have to do e-verify verifies whether this person is a [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4932.88s)]
*  citizen or not. And if the answer is no, then they don't get paid, they have to leave their job, [[01:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4938.72s)]
*  and then they will leave the country. They will self deport eventually, because they can't get [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4942.72s)]
*  hired anywhere except by, you know, somebody under the table. And so if Trump wanted to, [[01:22:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4946.72s)]
*  that's a that's a remedy that's been pushed on him by large factions of today's Republican party. [[01:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4951.6s)]
*  And he never speaks of it. He clearly doesn't want to do it. And I'm sure it's because he doesn't [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4957.4400000000005s)]
*  want to piss off the business community. And in particular, a lot of those Republicans who used to [[01:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4961.76s)]
*  be very pro open borders, Jason's not wrong about that either. Yeah, look, I think I think what's [[01:22:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4966.240000000001s)]
*  fair is we have to acknowledge we got to stick the landing here. We're in a very delicate situation. [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4972.16s)]
*  We're in the middle of a terror for we're trying to figure out how to navigate this very complex [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4976.48s)]
*  geopolitical situation with China. I think that we have to make sure that 98% of our energy is [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4980.879999999999s)]
*  going into that and the cascading set of issues that come from that. Because if we don't get that [[01:23:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4986.799999999999s)]
*  right, nothing else will matter that much. And so I think it's important to this is why you're [[01:23:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4991.759999999999s)]
*  favorite the tariffs, by the way, is this why you like the I'm a huge supporter of these tariffs for [[01:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=4996.639999999999s)]
*  one very specific reason, Megan. We completely ignored what we learned in COVID. What we should [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5002.88s)]
*  have taken away from COVID beyond the fact that we created the virus. The second thing we should [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5010.56s)]
*  have taken away is we are in an incredibly fragile position where we cannot take care of our own [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5015.68s)]
*  citizens if we need to. It's the most advanced country in the world that had the absolute worst [[01:23:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5021.68s)]
*  death rates in the world. We mandated school closures, we mandated masks, we mandated vaccines, [[01:23:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5026.56s)]
*  we probably made our citizenry sicker than they would have been otherwise. All for what? It's not [[01:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5032.96s)]
*  clear. And so taking a step back, what we should have done is started a holistic process to say, [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5038.400000000001s)]
*  if this or any other thing happens in the future, can we take care of our own people? [[01:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5045.04s)]
*  And the answer today is no. And I think what tariffs have done, at least for me, is laid [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5050.080000000001s)]
*  bare that we have had our eyes closed for 25 years. And if we don't wake up to the issue that [[01:24:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5056.24s)]
*  we cannot take care of ourselves, we are creating enormous compounding risk for US society. [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5062.96s)]
*  Yeah. And the thing about these mass deportations, I think just to wrap it up there, Megan, [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5069.92s)]
*  it's super important is it would cause a recession, it would cause 4% GDP contraction and [[01:24:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5073.92s)]
*  and that's really what it comes down to. And the areas where we do have illegal immigrants working, [[01:24:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5080.4800000000005s)]
*  construction, agriculture, and hospitality, these are critical industries for our country. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5087.040000000001s)]
*  Trump has used tons of illegal immigrants. It's all been documented in the early part of his career. [[01:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5093.4400000000005s)]
*  Republicans have been in favor of this. All I'm saying is, and I think we're actually in sync, [[01:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5098.56s)]
*  and this is one of the problems with America today, media today, which we are both part of, [[01:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5104.320000000001s)]
*  we're all part of it, is trying to find common ground. So instead of trying to stick me that, [[01:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5108.56s)]
*  or me trying to stick you, let's find the common ground here. Common ground, we want the border [[01:25:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5112.64s)]
*  closed, we want an orderly process. Common ground, we want all of the illegals that are committing [[01:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5116.080000000001s)]
*  crimes out of the country. On the margins, we might disagree about the level of due process. [[01:25:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5120.96s)]
*  Okay, fine. We can debate it and we can find a compromise there. We also need to have this [[01:25:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5125.6s)]
*  economy have a soft landing. And what Trump's doing with tariffs, a little too volatile for my [[01:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5131.4400000000005s)]
*  taste, we'll get into it, and this deportation concept. The reason he's not doing the deportation [[01:25:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5137.68s)]
*  is he knows it won him votes, but he knows it will crash the economy, therefore he's not doing it. [[01:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5143.12s)]
*  So we can actually, Megan, agree that we don't want to deport 10 million. Trump doesn't want to, [[01:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5147.6s)]
*  and you actually don't want to deport all 10 million. I actually, I don't, I disagree with you. [[01:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5152.88s)]
*  It will crash the economy. I don't agree with you. I don't agree. You want to crash the economy? [[01:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5156.0s)]
*  I asked, I don't agree with what happened. I asked you your opinion and I asked Chamath [[01:25:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5159.76s)]
*  his opinion. I did not yet give my opinion, but I will now. I don't think it would crash the economy. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5163.68s)]
*  I really don't. I think that if you pay Americans a living wage, these companies in Silicon Valley, [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5168.96s)]
*  these agricultural companies are going to have to increase the paycheck and then they will get [[01:26:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5174.64s)]
*  Americans who want to do these jobs. And that's not too bad. That's not a bad consequence to me. [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5178.56s)]
*  I actually think that's a doable thing and that it will improve the landscape of America [[01:26:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5182.88s)]
*  significantly. And I'm sorry that those people are here and tried to obey our laws once they [[01:26:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5187.04s)]
*  broke them to get in. It's really shouldn't be my problem. The composure of the company [[01:26:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5190.56s)]
*  has fundamentally changed as a result of these open borders. And it's not just on the face of [[01:26:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5195.92s)]
*  crime. It needs to change back. A lot of these people have no desire to assimilate. [[01:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5199.92s)]
*  And that's how we got into this mess. And the Democrats do have a master plan to get these [[01:26:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5204.080000000001s)]
*  people to start voting in elections, which is basically almost as bad as making Canada our 51st [[01:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5207.84s)]
*  state and letting all of them vote in our elections. It's just a mass of future Democrats that we don't [[01:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5212.400000000001s)]
*  want or need. So that's my position on it. Let me take a quick break and come back with a fun [[01:26:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5217.12s)]
*  clip. And then we'll find out how things went south between Chamath and Ezra Klein. All right, stand by. [[01:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5221.76s)]
*  These days, personal safety is not something that can be left to chance. Whether at home, [[01:27:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5228.64s)]
*  on the road, or just living everyday life, having a reliable way to protect yourself and your family [[01:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5233.04s)]
*  is crucial. That's why Berna is the choice for many. Berna is a game-changing, less lethal [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5237.599999999999s)]
*  self-defense tool. Compact, powerful, and easy to use. It provides the confidence to act in any [[01:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5244.0s)]
*  situation. Berna uses non-lethal rounds, tear gas, pepper, and kinetic projectiles to effectively [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5249.68s)]
*  stop a threat from a safe distance. And the best part? Berna can be shipped directly to your door, [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5256.48s)]
*  and it's legal in all 50 states. Berna is proudly American with products hand assembled in Fort Wayne, [[01:27:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5262.0s)]
*  Indiana. Sometimes a firearm is not the right option, and Berna provides a powerful alternative. [[01:27:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5268.0s)]
*  Protect what matters most with Berna. Visit Berna.com. That's b-y-r-n-a dot com slash Megan, [[01:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5274.24s)]
*  and that'll get you a 10% discount and learn why thousands of people and law enforcement agencies [[01:28:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5280.16s)]
*  are adding Berna's less lethal protection. Berna, non-lethal self-defense, always ready. [[01:28:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5286.0s)]
*  More and more Americans are making their health and fitness a priority again. And studies show [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5293.12s)]
*  that strength training does more to burn fat than cardio alone. Plus, as we age, it's critical to [[01:28:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5297.68s)]

*  left. He's got a New York Times podcast. And as the Senate Democrats meet today to figure out what [[01:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5355.2s)]
*  the hell happened this past year to them and what's going to happen on a go-forward basis, [[01:29:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5360.48s)]
*  they brought him in as like their keynote savior guy who's going to show them the way forward. [[01:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5364.72s)]
*  He and his data guru, who he interviewed not long ago about the numbers and how they're showing [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5370.5599999999995s)]
*  massive gaps with young men in particular and young people flocking to the Republican Party. [[01:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5376.4s)]
*  So you guys recently had Ezra Klein on the All In podcast. And he came for you [[01:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5382.32s)]
*  after you had told a story on All In about how accessible Trump is and how if you need to talk [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5388.799999999999s)]
*  to anybody in the administration, you pick up a phone and call them and they'll pick up and [[01:29:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5395.44s)]
*  actually speak to you. By the way, my experience as well. Well, he didn't much like that. And here's [[01:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5400.08s)]
*  how that went. This world in which we are doing the deal making by individual relationships, [[01:30:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5405.12s)]
*  by who can get their calls answered, not by rules that feel clear. That's how the Biden administration [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5412.64s)]
*  works. No, Ezra, you're trying to make it sound like corruption. The Trump administration, [[01:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5420.4s)]
*  what I have seen as a businessman, is willing to hear the conditions on the ground. As a businessman, [[01:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5425.44s)]
*  when I was building, Ezra, just to be clear, critical rare earth supplies for America [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5431.52s)]
*  under the Biden administration, battery canned materials to compete with China under the Biden [[01:30:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5436.240000000001s)]
*  administration, AI chips to be the best inference solution under the Biden administration, I couldn't [[01:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5442.0s)]
*  get a call back. That's just the facts. But he prefers the old regime, Chamath, because I guess [[01:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5447.68s)]
*  it was less susceptible to the kind of corruption you were clearly calling to talk about. [[01:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5455.6s)]
*  I think that there's a vein of Democrats that love this sort of like insider, clubby approach [[01:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5462.4800000000005s)]
*  of like Hollywood movie stars plus athletes plus the oval. And in that clip as well, he was talking [[01:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5469.360000000001s)]
*  about like George Clooney and I don't have anything against George Clooney, but my comment was more, [[01:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5478.72s)]
*  what does George Clooney know about business about anything? I don't particularly care what [[01:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5485.120000000001s)]
*  he thinks about business. Nor journalism for that matter. Just like you shouldn't care about [[01:31:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5488.8s)]
*  what I think about acting or directing. We all have our zones of excellence. And the point that [[01:31:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5494.08s)]
*  I was trying to make that I think really perturbed him is that, you know, Elon, myself, a whole bunch [[01:31:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5499.28s)]
*  of others that had been investing money, yes, but more important than money, all of our time, [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5505.28s)]
*  all of our social capital, all of our reputation to help the United States, [[01:31:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5510.64s)]
*  it went into a black hole under Biden. They just despised the idea that we were doing things. [[01:31:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5515.4400000000005s)]
*  And it made no sense because we were so pro-America and Pax America. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5522.08s)]
*  President Trump on the other side, he's not always going to agree with you. [[01:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5527.360000000001s)]
*  But what I find is that team wants to know what are the actual details. And they'll decide what [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5530.88s)]
*  they're going to decide. And I think that that's way better. Like, you know, when you're investing [[01:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5536.320000000001s)]
*  in a company, do you want a CEO that wants to know what's actually going on? Or that is cloistered [[01:32:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5539.84s)]
*  where there's four or five gatekeepers who then tell him their version of the truth. That I think [[01:32:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5545.6s)]
*  is really dangerous. And I don't see that here. I did see that with Biden. And that's why I got [[01:32:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5551.76s)]
*  frustrated with Asra because I think what he was basically saying is, you know, Trump is acting [[01:32:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5557.04s)]
*  quite democratically and speaking to everybody. I liked it better when I had the inside track and [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5561.92s)]
*  there was a, you know, in club and a not in club and I was in the in club. And I think that Democrats [[01:32:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5566.56s)]
*  have a tendency to do that. Now, again, they do that because that play has worked in the past. [[01:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5572.56s)]
*  Bring around the Hollywood star, bring around the athletes. And all of a sudden there's this patina [[01:32:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5578.4800000000005s)]
*  and everybody thinks it's amazing and cool. And I can dance and I can sing and I can play an instrument [[01:33:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5582.88s)]
*  and all this stuff looks cool. But under the surface, it's brittle and vacuous. Whereas here, [[01:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5587.84s)]
*  what I can tell you under Trump is the people that work for him are smart as hell. They'll [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5593.68s)]
*  argue with you. They'll debate issues with you. They'll ask you for what's going on. They'll talk [[01:33:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5598.240000000001s)]
*  to people that are on the exact opposite end of what they believe. That is what you want because [[01:33:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5602.88s)]
*  that healthy dialogue and debate, that's where you get to answers. And the reason why that's [[01:33:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5608.4800000000005s)]
*  important back to where I started is we're at a critical point in American history. We have to [[01:33:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5612.72s)]
*  have the courage to prioritize and you have to get the big decisions right. And I think that he [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5617.6s)]
*  is trending, the Trump administration is trending to get these big decisions right. And part of it [[01:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5623.36s)]
*  is because they're willing to talk to everybody. And I think that if you look back, that's what [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5629.28s)]
*  you will give credit for as what drove the success is because you knew the actual contours. [[01:33:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5635.36s)]
*  He will. You know, Jason, after Bill Maher went for his visit to the White House, one of the things [[01:34:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5641.12s)]
*  he said was we sat down, he asked me what I thought about Iran. What should I do about Iran? And, [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5645.36s)]
*  you know, Bill Maher's like, I don't know. But that is Trump will do that. And you may know, [[01:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5650.88s)]
*  you may have an opinion, you may have no opinion. But I think this is one of his strengths that he [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5656.400000000001s)]
*  will ask anybody, he'll hear anybody out. Yeah, you know, I am shocked, Megan, absolutely shocked [[01:34:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5660.56s)]
*  that money buys access or celebrity buys access. I never thought this would be the case with [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5668.320000000001s)]
*  politicians. I thought they were so pure. You know, the appearance of impropriety with this [[01:34:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5672.72s)]
*  administration is high, admittedly. But that doesn't mean it's causation. XRP, you know, [[01:34:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5677.92s)]
*  they had a big SEC suit, they donated millions to Trump, the suit went away. Jeff Yoss donated [[01:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5684.8s)]
*  tens of millions. And the TikTok ban got extended twice now. Apple showed up, they donated and- [[01:34:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5691.6s)]
*  How did it work out for Mark Zuckerberg? [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5699.68s)]
*  Well, yes, I was about to bring that up. And Apple came across. So we're going to have to [[01:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5702.0s)]
*  parse each of these, you know, Eric Trump's done a bunch of stuff with the Trump coin. [[01:35:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5705.84s)]
*  The SEC did a carve out for meme coins. So the appearance of impropriety isn't impropriety. But [[01:35:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5710.4800000000005s)]
*  I do understand with both sides how they feel like people are buying access and getting results. [[01:35:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5716.0s)]
*  That's the nature of the political- [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5720.72s)]
*  You're not going to make me bring up the Hunter Biden laptop. [[01:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5722.0s)]
*  Absolutely. Hunter Biden getting paid millions of dollars to be on the board of a company, [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5724.8s)]
*  that doesn't exist in the real world. Nobody gets paid millions of dollars. Even if you're [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5728.96s)]
*  on the board of Apple, I think you probably get like 250k. And that might be the highest paid [[01:35:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5732.24s)]
*  board in the world. Like it just doesn't exist. So grift exists, crime exists, paying for access [[01:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5736.88s)]
*  exists. And that's the American system. If we want to change this, we should not let Nancy Pelosi [[01:35:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5742.719999999999s)]
*  trade stocks. We should get rid of super PACs. There should be a cap put on that. I believe [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5748.16s)]
*  that's wrong. Even though many of my friends are donating tens of millions of dollars. [[01:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5753.04s)]
*  The Supreme Court already said no. [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5757.28s)]
*  Yeah, I know. I kind of feel like we should maybe readdress that and look at maybe [[01:35:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5759.76s)]
*  giving each of the last three candidates a certain amount of money to spend and make it a little bit [[01:36:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5763.76s)]
*  more fair. But I'm a bit of an idealist, as you know. Well, you can change the rules for elections. [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5767.6s)]
*  Congress does have that power, but they can't- Yeah. And you know, this is part of the democratic [[01:36:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5771.6s)]
*  process. And it does look at times, I understand the criticism that Trump looks coin operated at [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5776.24s)]
*  time. But I think we'll have to look at each of these individual cases. And if you put the [[01:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5781.84s)]
*  totality of together as Tramont's pointing out, I do have a lot of my lifelong friends who are [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5785.84s)]
*  working with Trump. Many of them are Democrats, by the way, for Trump to win the second election, [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5790.56s)]
*  he surrounded himself with Democrats like Chamath, Joe Rogan, Elon Musk, Tulsi, Bessent, [[01:36:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5794.72s)]
*  I mean, a gay Democrat. And we go right down the line, Howard Leibniz- [[01:36:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5802.72s)]
*  Bobby Kennedy. [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5805.4400000000005s)]
*  Lifelong, Bobby Kennedy, the ultimate Democrat. So I think you can give two pieces of really [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5805.92s)]
*  great credit. One, Democrats got Trump back in the White House. Number two, Democrats are incredibly [[01:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5812.08s)]
*  smart and effective business leaders who are now working with them. And number three, Trump is [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5817.92s)]
*  smart enough to know that he should flip all these Democrats and get them working in the White House. [[01:37:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5822.0s)]
*  And he is good at building bridges and making people feel incredibly special when he talks to [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5826.16s)]
*  them and giving them 100% of his attention. I give him a lot of credit for those things. [[01:37:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5831.36s)]
*  And you know what? That's why my position on Trump changed slightly, which is he surrounded himself [[01:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5835.36s)]
*  with lifelong Democrats who are highly effective. And so my friend Mark Pinkes as well, [[01:37:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5841.76s)]
*  this is just a long line of Democrats who got him in office this time. [[01:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5847.12s)]
*  Megyn Crosby He's not ideological. No, you're not wrong. He had a broad coalition of Republicans and [[01:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5849.68s)]
*  Dems, both in terms of his cabinet and in terms of the voting populace. [[01:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5854.8s)]
*  Howard Leibniz-Begin, The White House [[01:37:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5858.72s)]

*  Megyn Crosby I said that- [[01:37:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5863.52s)]
*  Howard Leibniz-Begin, The White House [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5864.88s)]
*  My earpiece went out. [[01:37:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5864.96s)]
*  Megyn Crosby This is why this kind of behavior is why they don't invite you to all the all in [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5865.68s)]
*  events, J Cal. [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5870.64s)]
*  I saw this clip. Steve Krakauer pulled this. This wasn't an MK find. This is a Steve Krakauer find [[01:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5871.679999999999s)]
*  where it turns out the besties are leaving J Cal out of their events. Let's watch. [[01:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5878.4s)]
*  Howard Leibniz-Begin, The White House [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5882.08s)]

*  Chamath is a member. And I just checked my Gmail. I checked all three of my Gmail accounts, [[01:38:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5888.48s)]
*  everything. No invite. You must have gotten lost again. [[01:38:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5892.5599999999995s)]
*  If you want to be a member, obviously there are dues and a membership fee. And [[01:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5896.08s)]
*  I just didn't want to waste your time with an offer. [[01:38:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5901.04s)]
*  Steve Krakauer Well, I just popped into reminisce about this trip [[01:38:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5904.56s)]

*  Steve Krakauer We had all the besties at the White House. It was really incredible. [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5911.2s)]
*  Howard Leibniz-Begin, The White House [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5914.320000000001s)]
*  It's interesting. I checked my spam filters and my invite got stuck in the spam filter. [[01:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5914.72s)]
*  You know, I had ski week this week, so I wouldn't have been able to make it anyway. [[01:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5920.16s)]
*  I see that you guys are all going to be in the next Jeopardy in the second round. [[01:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5923.04s)]
*  My invite to Jeopardy somehow got lost. That was kind of a bummer. [[01:38:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5926.8s)]
*  Steve Krakauer We have a good time. The Jeopardy thing is not real. That's photoshopped. [[01:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5929.68s)]
*  Heather Boucher Chamath, what's happening? Why isn't Jake [[01:38:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5934.88s)]

*  I guarantee you that Trump will have J. Cal eating out of the palm of his hand. [[01:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5954.8s)]
*  They are so similar in some ways. They're just they're meant to be besties, those two. [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5958.64s)]
*  Heather Boucher Chamath I am scared to meet Trump because I do think we might [[01:39:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5963.5199999999995s)]
*  wind up becoming besties. I think it's very likely. [[01:39:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5967.44s)]
*  Heather Boucher Chamath Well, in the meantime, the besties may be excluding you, [[01:39:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wCOR6p0cvAU&t=5971.84s)]
