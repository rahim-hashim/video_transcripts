# Trump Warns Iran and Israel on Ceasefire, & NYC's Potential Socialist Rapper Mayor, w/ Fifth Column
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [June 24, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. The news on Iran and Israel [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=0.0s)]
*  and President Trump's involvement in brokering a ceasefire deal has been quickly developing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4.72s)]
*  I mean, like don't leave your phone if you want to stay up in the latest because it changes [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=10.48s)]
*  every 60 seconds it seems. President Trump announced last night on Truth Social that Israel [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=15.52s)]
*  and Iran agreed on a quote, complete and total ceasefire that would take effect in six hours. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=20.72s)]
*  But shortly after that was set to take effect, Iran launched a wave of missiles at Israel, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=27.76s)]
*  reportedly killing at least four. Okay, so it hadn't yet kicked in, but it was about to kick in [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=33.28s)]
*  and Iran decided to do a bunch of killing before it officially kicked in. What the F? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=37.68s)]
*  Israel responded by targeting the sites from which those bombs had been launched. They've got four [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=44.0s)]
*  dead in Israel, 26 wounded as a result of those pre-ceasefire, you know, for good old time's sake, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=49.84s)]
*  bombings by Iran, again, WTF. So Israel responded before the ceasefire. And then there was a couple [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=56.8s)]
*  of collateral incidents. There were a couple of collateral incidents right after the ceasefire [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=67.2s)]
*  kicked in where Iran, question mark, launched two separate missile barrages at Israel, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=72.8s)]
*  none of which hurt anybody and both of which appear to have been stopped by Iron Dome [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=81.84s)]
*  or in some other way by Israel. And that's Trump is unhappy. He's unhappy because [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=85.92s)]
*  Israel responded to those two bombing those sites and the ceasefire. Look in the Middle East, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=94.88s)]
*  ceasefire, it's basically it's paused and there might be a few, you know, extra bombings. We have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=101.84s)]
*  to wait to find out, but like you could still be in a ceasefire, but he just loved bombing so much. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=110.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, truly they just bomb, bomb, bomb. This is like what it's like. I mean, so many of my [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=115.68s)]
*  friends, my Israeli friends or my Jewish friends are like, Megan, do you want to go to Israel? [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  We'd love to take you. I don't know. I do not want to go to Israel. Thanks. But no, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=126.0s)]
*  why would I want to go to Israel right now? I'm sorry. I love the Israeli people, [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=130.32s)]
*  but I have zero desire to go to Israel. Just like I have zero desire to go to the Iranian nuclear [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=134.56s)]
*  sites. Right. I don't want to go places where people are getting bombed. And what I do at night [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=140.0s)]
*  is pray. I pray for my friends in Israel. I have dear friends who have family there, but like, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=144.16s)]
*  this is no way to live. And Israel's been trying to stop it for many, many years. They can't stop it. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=150.48s)]
*  There's many nations around them and factions that want them dead and wiped off the face of the earth. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=156.64s)]
*  And it's going to be really hard to talk Iran out of it. The best we can do is get them to, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=161.68s)]
*  at least on paper, maybe say that they'll stop which Trump has achieved. But you know, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=166.32s)]
*  there's obviously a question as to is it worth the paper it's printed on? [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=173.52s)]
*  President Trump signaling he's not happy with Israel and he's not happy with Iran. I have to say [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=178.32000000000002s)]
*  what you're going about to hear, you'll hear it here. And then we have a longer sound bite in a [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=183.60000000000002s)]
*  minute with him taking aim at Israel too is very unusual for us president, but it's good. It's good [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=186.64000000000001s)]
*  for Trump because he understands in order for this deal to have support, he needs, he needs [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Middle Easterners to be behind it. He needs some of our Middle East allies to be behind it. And it [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=196.24s)]
*  can't always be just a knee jerk reflexive. We're with Israel, we're with Israel, we're with Israel, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=201.44s)]
*  and they can do no wrong. That's what Trump is trying to signal here. So he's not happy with [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=206.16s)]
*  either party. And here he was on the White House lawn this morning, just about to take off for a [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=212.07999999999998s)]
*  NATO meeting. Not mincing words. We have, we basically have two countries that have been [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=217.52s)]
*  fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=224.72s)]
*  I mean, those are terms you might hear on the Megyn Kelly show, but it's very rare to [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=231.44s)]
*  rare to hear the president drop an F bomb. Very rarely he'll do it like in one of his comedy bits [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=241.12s)]
*  at one of his rallies. But I don't remember him doing it when, you know, commenting on a serious [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=246.96s)]
*  policy matter before. And he knows what he's doing. I mean, he's expressing his frustration [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=252.72s)]
*  at the way things go in the Middle East and the way these players respond. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=259.36s)]
*  And he also really wants the ceasefire. You know, it's kind of like Trump thinks this deal is done [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=265.92s)]
*  and that should be it. You know, should hang the deal toy off the ceiling at the 21 club and have [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=271.44s)]
*  a steak. 21 club is no longer thanks to COVID. In any event, that's how deals used to get done here [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=276.88s)]
*  in New York. And actually, if memory serves, is Trump featured in Wall Street when they go [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=283.28s)]
*  into the 21 club? He might be. He's in so many of New York movies featuring New York. Anyway, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=288.71999999999997s)]
*  my point is he's frustrated and who could blame him? Aren't we all? It's like, [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=294.96s)]
*  they're never going to stop fighting. That's how this feels. They're just never going to stop [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=300.48s)]
*  fighting. Look, we did our part. He did our part. He protected the United States. He bombed the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=304.88s)]
*  nuclear facilities. It's what every president has said needs to be done in terms of stopping them. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=310.0s)]
*  Only Trump had the balls to do it. Matthew Contenetti, who's a great writer. He's writing [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=315.04s)]
*  over at the Free Press among other places now and he's on the commentary podcast. He had this post [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=320.24s)]
*  and here's part of it. He writes, George W. Bush, Barack Obama, Donald Trump and Joe Biden all said [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=326.16s)]
*  a nuclear Iran was intolerable. Yet only Trump paired words with deeds. Only Trump sent Ayatollah [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=331.36s)]
*  Khamenei reeling. The promises were clear enough. Quote, I take the threat of Iran with a nuclear [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=338.72s)]
*  weapon very seriously. Bush 2007 quote, we will not Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon period. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=343.92s)]
*  Biden in a vice presidential debate 2012 quote, the goal for these negotiations is to reach a [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=350.48s)]
*  mutually agreed long-term comprehensive solution that would ensure Iran's nuclear program will be [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=356.40000000000003s)]
*  exclusively peaceful. Obama 2015. Kamala Harris just last year when she was running as president, [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=360.4s)]
*  I will never allow Iran to acquire a nuclear weapon. Contenetti goes on and how have Trump's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=369.35999999999996s)]
*  living predecessors and his 2024 rival reacted now to Operation Midnight Hammer? Crickets. Not one has [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=374.56s)]
*  issued a statement at this writing on the most significant foreign policy action in a generation. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=383.35999999999996s)]
*  Why? Too busy at Huma Abedin's wedding to Alex Soros? Great point. All right. Trump did what was [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=389.44s)]
*  necessary to protect the United States of America. Iran cannot have a nuclear weapon. All those [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=398.56s)]
*  statements were not just because we care about Israel, which we do. We care about ourselves. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=405.68s)]
*  We care about our troops in Middle East posts, not far from Iran. And it was very clear across [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=410.48s)]
*  partisan lines that Iran could not have a nuclear weapon, but only Trump actually did something [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=417.52s)]
*  about it. But in terms of actually stopping these two from fighting and launching missiles at each [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=422.4s)]
*  other and bombs, I'm not hopeful. I'm sorry. I wish I were. I'm not. I think it's still a major win [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=429.12s)]
*  that the conflict that was starting between us and Iran appears to be off for now. They launched those [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=437.28s)]
*  attacks on our bases in Qatar and one on our base in Iraq yesterday when we were on the air together. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=446.72s)]
*  And then they stopped. That was it. It was symbolic. They gave us a heads up. Trump later in his [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=454.16s)]
*  true social laid it out saying, thanks for the heads up so that nobody got killed. We understand [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=458.64000000000004s)]
*  you sent 14 bombs, 13 of which we intercepted and one of which we allowed to land because it [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=463.84000000000003s)]
*  wasn't going to hit anything or anyone. And nobody was hurt or killed. Thanks. We appreciate it. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=470.0s)]
*  And nothing else has happened with respect to the United States for us, at least now, given the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  posture we were in 72 hours ago, that's very good news. So Trump now is off on a long flight to the [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=480.32000000000005s)]
*  Netherlands. He has his phone and he's truthing away. So we'll bring you some updates on what he's [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=487.20000000000005s)]
*  saying. Plus the New York Democratic primary for mayor is today. And by the polymarket odds, it [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=493.28000000000003s)]
*  appears that socialist candidate Zoran Mbamdon may beat disgraced former governor Cuomo. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=499.28s)]
*  I mean, I never thought I'd say these words, but go governor Cuomo. I can't believe it. Janis [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=507.84s)]
*  Deane is just, she's got a shiver down her spine somewhere, but we can't have this lunatic mom, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=515.92s)]
*  Donnie. We cannot have him running the world's greatest city. New York city is the greatest city [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=520.64s)]
*  in the world, even as hobbled as it's been by years of Democrat control. And it cannot be in [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=527.52s)]
*  the hands of an avowed socialist. It cannot. It's already hobbling along. Thanks to many years now [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=535.12s)]
*  of Democrat rule post the Bloomberg Giuliani, a delightful 12. So that's what we're going to [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=543.6s)]
*  be watching today as the poll results come in. First, we're going to be joined by our guests [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=550.0s)]
*  here to discuss it all and more. Camille Foster, partner at Freethink, Michael Moynihan, host of [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=554.48s)]
*  the Moynihan Report on Two Way, and Matt Welsh, editor at large for Reason. Together, they are [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=559.2s)]

*  If you are dealing with back taxes or you miss the April 15th deadline, don't wait. The IRS is [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=588.2399999999999s)]
*  rapidly stepping up enforcement. Penalties can add up quickly, up to 5% per month, maxing out at 25% [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=592.88s)]
*  of your total tax bill, just for not filing. And that's on top of what you already owe. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=599.28s)]

*  start with, before we get to Mondami, because there's a lot to talk about with that lunatic. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=646.3199999999999s)]

*  But let's talk first about what I said at the top about the Middle East and the ceasefire. Is it on? [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=655.52s)]
*  Is it not off? Trump dropping the F-bomb at these two out of frustration. You know, what do you, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=660.7199999999999s)]
*  let's just kick it off with what you make of my take on it, which is like, we should just be happy [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=667.52s)]
*  they're no longer launching bombs at us, and that the retaliation for our bomb dropping appears to [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=671.04s)]
*  be done, and that they're back to sort of launching these mini bombs at each other or not, and maybe [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=676.48s)]
*  pausing, and maybe not unclear. Your take. Well, let's start with this, Megan. I mean, the response [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=682.0799999999999s)]
*  from the Iranians, there's two things about this. One is that they telegraphed it to everybody. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=692.3199999999999s)]
*  They sent out like, this is what we're going to do. And by this is what's going to happen. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=699.6s)]
*  This is how many missiles, because they don't really want to provoke us. But they want to [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=703.28s)]
*  symbolically say we're going to attack one of your bases in Qatar. The Qataris are, of course, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  not an ally, but as close as you can be to an ally with Iran in the region. And the Qataris, [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=713.52s)]
*  by the way, responded by shooting them all out of the sky and saying, well, we leave open the [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=720.48s)]
*  possibility to respond to this, which was pretty remarkable. So what they did was what they could [[00:12:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=725.52s)]
*  do, which was not much. So that's pretty reassuring. As you pointed out, Megan, down the road, [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=731.36s)]
*  we'll see what happens. The Iranians have been hitting Americans and American citizens and [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=736.5600000000001s)]
*  American military targets since 1979 from taking hostages the second they took over in the American [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=742.24s)]
*  embassy in Tehran in 79. So they have a long history of doing this. But right now, they are [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=749.12s)]
*  absolutely defanged. And you have somebody like Brett McGurk, who was the Biden White House's [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=754.5600000000001s)]
*  coordinator for the Middle East or something, saying that this is the best possible place that [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=761.44s)]
*  we could be in and congratulating President Trump for managing this crisis. Good Lord. I mean, [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=766.4s)]
*  talk about, you know, when you're getting Brett McGurk to say you're doing a good job, these are [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=772.96s)]
*  people that never say anything positive about Trump. And one final thing is that I think you're [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=776.56s)]
*  absolutely right about something that I, for one, who have been incredibly critical of Trump, I mean, [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=781.8399999999999s)]
*  the podcast has been incredibly critical of Trump for where we think he deserves it. I'm been praising [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=787.52s)]
*  him for this. But I think that you're right in the thing that people don't understand. You have to [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=793.28s)]
*  keep so many people in the Middle East on board. Everyone is pointing out that so many of these [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=798.9599999999999s)]
*  countries in the Middle East, like the Saudis, like the Qataris, and like the Jordanians are [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=803.28s)]
*  quietly saying go Trump, but not doing it publicly because they have a, you know, restive population [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=808.72s)]
*  that are not huge fans of the Israelis. That moment when he's like, these guys, they don't [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=813.8399999999999s)]
*  the fuck they're doing, which is like, I don't know exactly what he's saying. But when he's [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=818.56s)]
*  telegraphing to those people that look, we're going to criticize Israel too. We're not on board [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=822.24s)]
*  entirely. You guys have been been lovely and quiet about this, not criticizing us, we're going to [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=827.04s)]
*  kind of reciprocate. I think that was a yeah, is he mad at Netanyahu? But as you pointed out, Megan, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=832.32s)]
*  that was a response to the Iranians breaking a ceasefire that first of all, everyone said that [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=838.0s)]
*  they didn't really agree to and then said that they did. But yeah, I think that that was definitely [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=842.6400000000001s)]
*  a wise decision. Because of the way Trump presents so many things, we just tend to think that he's [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=847.6s)]
*  flying, you know, the seat of his pants and just, you know, you know, kind of ad-libbing. I think [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=853.44s)]
*  that that stuff is very well calibrated to say, let's throw a little dart at the Israelis, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=858.72s)]
*  make sure that everyone understands where we are here. We're not doing this on behalf of Israel, [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=864.48s)]
*  but on behalf of us and for you guys too, in the Middle East, who actually don't love the Iranians. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=868.48s)]
*  My fingers are crossed that all of this is true and good and we're in a good place and the bad [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=873.6s)]
*  things didn't happen. But I would really caution everybody not to get too optimistic about this [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=880.88s)]
*  because we have been similarly in moments of temporary euphoria about the exercise of American [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=885.6s)]
*  power in the Middle East and then things didn't go out so well. In August of 2011, a lot of [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=892.48s)]
*  Democrats over the opposition of Republicans were crowing that they got rid of the Gaddafi regime [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=898.8000000000001s)]
*  in Libya and wasn't that the use of American power at its best? In Hillary Clinton's words, [[00:15:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=904.72s)]
*  we were a bit triumphant. In March of 1991, my God, we won the Gulf War so fast, [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=911.04s)]
*  people's heads snapped and wasn't it great? And then that led to a thing that we should think [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=915.4399999999999s)]
*  about now, which is for the rest of the 90s, more or less, the U.S. created no-fly zones over Iraq. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=919.84s)]
*  So it was just sort of this low-level kind of war. We kind of control this. What is Israel going to [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=927.4399999999999s)]
*  do in Iran right now? Israel controls the airspace of Iran and doesn't want them to get a nuclear [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=933.12s)]
*  weapon and doesn't want them to develop missile technology. Are they going to patrol that? Would [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=937.76s)]
*  the U.S. help over the next stretch? We don't know because you don't know what is going to happen [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=942.3199999999999s)]
*  next either in the Middle East or after a big war. There's a lot of things to be concerned about [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=947.76s)]
*  going forward. I'm less convinced as you are and Michael are that the use of U.S. power in this [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=952.88s)]
*  case was the correct one. I think that we should be more skeptical in general about the use of U.S. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=959.36s)]
*  force against people who haven't attacked us this week or anytime recently because we have the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=964.88s)]
*  biggest, most powerful military in the world and when you are using it against sovereign, [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=972.32s)]
*  crappy countries that are nonetheless sovereign, you open up a lot of potential downstream effects [[00:16:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=977.76s)]
*  that you can't predict for now, but that could be negative. So my fingers are crossed and you can [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=984.24s)]
*  see the window into how this was worked. Everyone seems to be kind of de-escalating right now. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=990.08s)]
*  It's possible that the mullahs are so terrified that they are willing to make some kind of deal [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=994.96s)]
*  to protect their survival. They don't have allies really and that's a part. Where are their friends? [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1000.08s)]
*  Not many friends and Israel, I mean you're a little bit pessimistic Megan about the state of [[00:16:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1006.48s)]
*  Israel or its ability. Israel has absolutely, not absolutely, but has like very impressively defanged [[00:16:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1012.1600000000001s)]
*  the ring of fire and I know that's a mixed metaphor around it that Iran has created [[00:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1019.92s)]
*  through proxies over time. It's been kind of an amazing tactical success on their part. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1023.5999999999999s)]
*  So fingers can be crossed on this but I'm not optimistic. I'm not skeptical about Israel's [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1028.8s)]
*  ability to fight, not even a little. I'm skeptical about the prospects of a lasting ceasefire in the [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1033.76s)]
*  Middle East that Israel will stand down, that Iran will stand down, that one of Iran's proxies will [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1041.52s)]
*  remain down. Someone's going to keep launching bombs into Israel and Israel always responds. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1048.24s)]
*  That's what I'm saying. I know Israel can do it. What their military's done over the past [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1054.24s)]
*  couple of years has been spectacular. It's been actually, I mean I'm not endorsing the level of [[00:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1058.32s)]
*  death. I'm saying they're very, very competent at killing their enemies. That we've seen. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1064.48s)]
*  So I have no doubt that. It's non-stop. It's non-stop violence in the Middle East. This is why I [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1069.76s)]
*  don't really want to go to Israel. This is why I think a lot of people don't want to go to Israel. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1075.44s)]
*  And it's why, I think a lot of us who have been paying attention to the Middle East for a long [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1079.6000000000001s)]
*  time feel exactly how President Trump felt this morning. What the fuck? These people don't know. [[00:18:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1083.52s)]
*  Right? That's the right attitude when it comes to the Middle East matter. Sorry, Matt. Go ahead. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1088.8s)]
*  No, just that they've defanged Hezbollah from firing those 100,000 rockets over the [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1094.64s)]
*  northern border. That's a huge change. Hezbollah's a completely Iranian created [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1101.68s)]
*  subsidiary. And they're like, ah, we're going to sit this one out. So that's a sign they have [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1107.3600000000001s)]
*  actually made progress in having fewer missiles go at them, even though they had missiles kill people [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1110.96s)]
*  yesterday. I mean, progress in this part of the world is awkward and incremental at best. But [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1117.04s)]
*  there has been meaningful progress. And I'm a little bit surprised here because I think I might be [[00:18:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1124.0800000000002s)]
*  not the least skeptical person about whether or not the Trump administration made the right decision. [[00:18:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1129.44s)]
*  It seems like they made a pretty pragmatic calculation that at this particular time, [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1134.56s)]
*  given the pressure Iran was under, given the fact that they didn't have anyone who was likely to [[00:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1139.44s)]
*  come to their defense here, that the Americans could sneak in and carry out a pretty devastating [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1143.12s)]
*  attack on these nuclear facilities that have long been a concern. And it is not yet clear how much, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1149.6s)]
*  how effective those bombings were. And we'll learn more about that in the days and weeks to come, [[00:19:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1155.76s)]
*  we hope. But what is pretty clear is that there was a concerted effort on the part of the [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1160.08s)]
*  administration to broadcast to Iran, this could be it. And that that message was well received by [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1166.56s)]
*  the Iranians and even the kind of calibrated use of profanity this morning, because it did seem [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1173.28s)]
*  pretty like a pretty deliberate choice on the president's part. The fact that he's directing [[00:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1179.04s)]
*  some of the criticism at Israel as well, being that he they seem to be navigating this very [[00:19:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1182.72s)]
*  difficult situation pretty well. All of that said, I will say that once it gets to the point where [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1188.8s)]
*  you're lobbing bombs at people, as opposed to using the tools of diplomacy, this is a it, [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1194.4s)]
*  I suppose, by definition, something of a failure if someone hasn't lobbed a bomb at you already. [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1200.32s)]
*  But they do seem to be making some progress here. And one has to hope for a good outcome. And again, [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1205.92s)]
*  a really difficult, protracted situation that we suspect this is probably an interregnum, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1212.16s)]
*  as opposed to a durable lasting peace. But it could be a really useful ignorant interregnum. [[00:20:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1217.8400000000001s)]
*  And it could very well be the sort of thing that creates substantial problems for the Iranian [[00:20:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1223.1200000000001s)]
*  machine. It's one of those things where it's like, it's not our job to create peace in the Middle [[00:20:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1228.48s)]
*  East. It's really not. Right. And it is our job to protect American interests and the American [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1232.96s)]
*  people. And I think Trump, consistent with all those other presidents, as I just went through, [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1239.92s)]
*  citing the Continental Peace, and we did some of this yesterday too on the show, [[00:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1244.24s)]
*  believes truly that Iran cannot get a nuclear weapon. They're too crazy. They're too jihadi. [[00:20:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1247.76s)]
*  They're too they're a little too keen on killing the Western infidels in order to trust that. [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1254.0s)]
*  So given how weak they've been, they are right now Trump's opportunity and he took it and was [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1259.28s)]
*  also given Intel. Yes, by the Israelis, that's got an asterix on it as always, but also by the [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1264.64s)]
*  assessment that they reached 60% uranium enrichment and that there had been an acceleration [[00:21:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1270.56s)]
*  in the number of centrifuges over the past seven, eight months. So he did have data in front of him [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1276.32s)]
*  and who knows what else we don't get to see what President Trump gets to see in terms of Intel. [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1281.1999999999998s)]
*  So I trust him that he thought that it was a valid intelligence assessment, that they were speeding [[00:21:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1286.24s)]
*  up toward the nuclear bomb. And it makes sense to me too, given how weakened they were. I mean, [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1294.32s)]
*  when you corner an animal, it lashes out. It doesn't usually just fold and ask for peace. [[00:21:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1299.04s)]
*  It will tend to bite you from that corner. And so it makes sense to me in any event. But the [[00:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1304.8s)]
*  larger question of peace in the Middle East, I mean, like, okay, how many presidents have tried [[00:21:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1310.56s)]
*  that? Some have gotten Nobel peace prizes only for the whole region of wind up under missile fire. [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1315.92s)]
*  Again, it's just that that's just too big. I applaud him for trying. You know, when we were [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1322.24s)]
*  talking about possibly a deal yesterday, I was saying to Emily Jushinsky, well, like, what is the [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1326.96s)]
*  deal? What's the deal? Like we said, stop trying to develop a nuke. They slow rolled us. Then we [[00:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1332.08s)]
*  bombed their nuclear facilities. It's kind of done. We got what we wanted. And the big announcement [[00:22:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1338.4s)]
*  was ceasefire between the other two. Great. I mean, I care about that too, but that's really [[00:22:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1344.64s)]
*  between them in the same way like the fighting since 10-7 has been between Israel and it's many, [[00:22:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1350.72s)]
*  many haters over there. And I, on this show, we haven't really covered the day to day battles [[00:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1357.04s)]
*  because it's really not America's fight. But look, I understand Israel's our ally, Iran not, [[00:22:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1361.3600000000001s)]
*  its proxies aren't, but it's really not exactly our fight. Go ahead, Michael. [[00:22:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1367.44s)]
*  Well, a couple of things about this. I mean, to your point about Trump's intelligence and what he [[00:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1372.08s)]
*  has and what we haven't seen and just kind of bouncing off of what Matt said, there are a lot [[00:22:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1378.64s)]
*  of lessons to learn from Iraq and to be skeptical. And I agree with Matt, by the way, it's like, this [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1383.8400000000001s)]
*  is a momentary success, but let's not think this is a lasting success. And there should be no spiking [[00:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1389.1200000000001s)]
*  the ball in the end zone relating to anything in the Middle East. No, if you defeat Grenada in 1983, [[00:23:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1396.48s)]
*  spike the ball. If you're a big, any big in the Middle East, no spiking. But the difference is [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1404.32s)]
*  this, is that in 2003, leading up to the Iraq war, you couldn't find a lot of Republicans who [[00:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1410.56s)]
*  disagreed with the Bush administration's desire to go into Iraq and dislodge Saddam Hussein. [[00:23:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1418.0s)]
*  Trump, you know, is doing something that is actively going to fracture part of his coalition [[00:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1424.0s)]
*  or runs the risk of fracturing his coalition. And he did it anyway, which is pretty interesting [[00:23:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1430.16s)]
*  and pretty impressive. And, you know, look, there's a couple of political points here. I mean, [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1436.3200000000002s)]
*  he put on Truth Social something about some congressman who had nominated him for the Nobel [[00:24:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1441.44s)]
*  Peace Prize. And by the way, to get nominated, you just need somebody from a legislature anywhere [[00:24:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1446.8000000000002s)]
*  in the world can nominate. So I think that's how he sees this. And that's perfectly fine to see it [[00:24:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1452.4s)]
*  that way. Because what happened in 1995, Congress passed a bit of legislation, what was the I think [[00:24:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1457.2s)]
*  was the Jerusalem Embassy Act. And what was it 23 years later after, as you said, Megan, according [[00:24:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1464.72s)]
*  to the great Matt Contenetti, who's a friend, and I think he's brilliant, is that everyone said they're [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1470.32s)]
*  going to do it. And then 2018, Trump does it. Everyone says they cannot have a new and people [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1474.4s)]
*  are shocked that Trump has done this. It was pointed out, and I hadn't even realized this, [[00:24:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1481.04s)]
*  that golden escalator speech, the very speech, he said that evening that Iran can't get a nuclear [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1485.6s)]
*  weapon. So he's pretty consistent on this issue. And I think it's, you know, to his incredible [[00:24:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1493.52s)]
*  credit, again, as someone who's been very critical of him, I think it's to his credit that he's [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1498.48s)]
*  actually said, this is what I'm going to do. And I did it. And I've seen a lot of saw someone this [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1503.6s)]
*  morning saying, you know, it is it is a right, why isn't it not their right to enrich uranium [[00:25:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1509.04s)]
*  and create a nuclear weapon is the same thing as the Israelis, guns, etc. The United States, [[00:25:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1516.8s)]
*  Pakistan, too crazy. That will that is what you said. And that's right. It reminded me of what [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1522.08s)]
*  William Buckley once said, he said, if you see someone pushing an old woman out of the way of [[00:25:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1527.12s)]
*  the car, and another one pushing a woman into a car, they're not both people who push old ladies [[00:25:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1532.1599999999999s)]
*  around. This is a different thing when they have a nuclear weapon. And so look, I don't in any way, [[00:25:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1536.88s)]
*  I'm not celebratory about this. I am happy. But as you point out, this is the most important point [[00:25:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1545.0400000000002s)]
*  for everyone to realize is that what Israel tries to do is to push back the capabilities of [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1550.5600000000002s)]
*  people trying to destroy them, the people of Hezbollah, that leadership has been destroyed, [[00:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1558.96s)]
*  the IRGC leadership in Tehran has been destroyed, the Assad regime has been destroyed, Assad is now [[00:26:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1564.4s)]
*  in Moscow. These are great victories. It has not changed the idea of the people that followed Assad, [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1570.16s)]
*  the people that signed up for Hezbollah, the people that are allies of the regime in Iran, [[00:26:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1576.4s)]
*  that Israel must be destroyed. That is something that you cannot necessarily bomb into submission. [[00:26:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1580.96s)]
*  So when people say like Trump said the other day, what's the problem with regime change? [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1586.3200000000002s)]
*  They're a bad regime. I'd like to see them change. It's like me too. I oppose us getting [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1589.84s)]
*  involved in that and trying to dictate things. But if it precipitates the failure of the disgusting, [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1594.48s)]
*  horrible, murderous regime in Tehran that has been oppressing its own people since 1979, great. But [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1602.16s)]
*  I don't want to be involved in that. As you guys know, we've discussed Trump actually proposed [[00:26:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1609.6s)]
*  Gaziera, Mara Gaza. Trump looks at this vision like anything's possible. Yeah, let's say let's [[00:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1614.8s)]
*  make everybody rich and we'll build instead of destroy and things will be so much better. [[00:27:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1622.8799999999999s)]
*  Like just let's just do that. And it's like he's a sunny optimist in so many ways. And then when [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1627.76s)]
*  people don't live up to his optimistic vision and like version of them, he's like, what the fuck? [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1633.9199999999998s)]
*  What's wrong with you? I mean, I bought a timeshare in con units because I was like, [[00:27:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1641.12s)]
*  probably a bad investment. I think there's one problem or at least one caveat we should think [[00:27:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1647.12s)]
*  about in terms of the Matt Continenti perplex, which is you could you could make the exact same [[00:27:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1650.96s)]
*  clip job of statements by US presidents, every single one saying that about North Korea. [[00:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1658.8s)]
*  And we didn't press the do something button. We have the mother of all do something buttons, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1665.04s)]
*  which is the US military. We didn't do that. So should we have should be now? That's a difficult [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1669.6s)]
*  question. I think the my answer being sort of a constitution is libertarian semi peacenik is no, [[00:27:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1675.4399999999998s)]
*  we shouldn't bomb North Korea, North Korea is arguably more psychopathic, but has much less [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1683.36s)]
*  reach than Iran. Iran has been been an active menace in the Middle East for the last half century. [[00:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1689.28s)]
*  North Korea has thrown some cannon fodder into the rush to Ukraine war, but otherwise is pretty [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1695.2800000000002s)]
*  ineffectual, generally speaking. But is whenever you know, part of diplomacy is say, well, you [[00:28:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1699.92s)]
*  shouldn't have this, we refuse to have that. But do you really mean by that, that if the other actor [[00:28:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1705.6000000000001s)]
*  doesn't abide by those words that we're going to press this incredibly lethal destabilizing do [[00:28:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1713.2s)]
*  something button against a sovereign country, I recognize that diplomacy, and especially [[00:28:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1719.6s)]
*  diplomacy between people who are antagonists is absolutely frustrating, messy, ineffectual and bad. [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1726.1599999999999s)]
*  That is what it's always been. That's kind of the point of it is that people who disagree with each [[00:28:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1732.6399999999999s)]
*  other are trying to come up with some kind of way to coexist without shooting each other. But it is [[00:28:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1737.28s)]
*  kind of a failure of diplomacy when you end up in a war situation. And we should be skeptical, I think [[00:29:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1742.3999999999999s)]
*  we should be reticent to hit that do something button, even when psychopathic regimes are [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1748.0s)]
*  developing nuclear weapons. But I have no love for Pakistan. Don't they shelter Osama bin Laden last [[00:29:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1753.92s)]
*  time I looked for quite some time, there is a lot of problems with that country. And I'm going to [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1759.52s)]
*  start with my best. I agree, you don't go around bombing the bad countries. I know. But but I the [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1764.24s)]
*  situation is much more layered than that. You know, I mean, what happened? I'm not going to go through [[00:29:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1769.6s)]
*  the whole thing. I did at this top of the show yesterday. But the short version is the thumbnail [[00:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1774.24s)]
*  version is Iran attacked Israel on 10 7 through its proxy Hamas. They were they funded Hamas. [[00:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1778.16s)]
*  I mean, Iran was funding Al Qaeda. I mean, Iran has been funding a lot of deaths of Americans and [[00:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1784.8s)]
*  people Americans love for a long, long time now. So Iran funded that attack against Israel and [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1790.96s)]
*  through Hamas. So Israel gets attacked. And Israel spent the next two years taking down everyone who [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1796.56s)]
*  attacked it, you know, mob style, like everyone that you the entire family like the Godfather [[00:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1801.84s)]
*  style like him his entire family dead, dead. And they did it both Hamas and then Hezbollah and then [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1808.24s)]
*  the Houthis and then we help with the Houthis and so on and then the Assad regime falls. [[00:30:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1814.3999999999999s)]
*  And then you have all these Iranian proxies that are now gone or their heads have been chopped off. [[00:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1818.0s)]
*  And at this point, there's some Intel saying Iran is now accelerating its bomb. Because I think [[00:30:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1824.3999999999999s)]
*  because it's like a cornered animal and it's starting to panic. And I actually believe the [[00:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1831.44s)]
*  reports that it was ramping up. And I said yesterday, BB is not really he has no credibility for me. [[00:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1835.6000000000001s)]
*  I mean, I just I've watched him every year say there's six weeks away. There's six months away [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1841.8400000000001s)]
*  in 2012. I was on the air when he held up his little picture of the bomb that you'd see like [[00:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1845.3600000000001s)]
*  in a Disney cartoon as like the round bomb with little views at the top, trying to show us that [[00:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1849.8400000000001s)]
*  they were about to have it within months. That's 2012. He is to the bomb claims what the leftist [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1855.84s)]
*  Greta Thunberg's are to the climate catastrophe claims. That's true. I'm sorry, but that's true [[00:31:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1862.48s)]
*  with Netanyahu. His defenders will say, oh, but Israel intervened to slow it all down. I okay. I [[00:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1868.1599999999999s)]
*  don't really believe that that's what stopped. I think he overstated time and time again how close [[00:31:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1873.1999999999998s)]
*  they were. That's my point. I'm just simply saying that that it was more complicated than this [[00:31:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1878.0s)]
*  because Israel had created conditions in fighting back that made this an ideal time to take it to [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1886.24s)]
*  achieve the goal that all these other presidents agreed we needed to do. Go ahead. Yeah. Well, [[00:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1893.04s)]
*  first off, I want to make sure that no matter how much you hate Benjamin Netanyahu, please don't [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1897.84s)]
*  compare anyone to Greta Thunberg because that's just like a slap in the face. I mean, like, [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1902.96s)]

*  compared me to Greta Thunberg. Yeah. A couple of things like to slightly disagree with my co-host [[00:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1913.68s)]
*  here, Matt. I mean, the thing about the North Korea comparison, and I get the idea that there's [[00:32:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1921.2s)]
*  different times for this when you say no one's done anything in the way that that that Matt [[00:32:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1927.76s)]
*  Contenetti wrote. But if there is a moment in which the South Koreans were in an active war [[00:32:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1932.0s)]
*  with the North Koreans and the North Koreans had lost all of its allies, couldn't do anything, [[00:32:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1938.72s)]
*  was totally defanged. And at the same time, you could actually liberate the people of North Korea [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1943.28s)]
*  who have been living under the most oppressive regime on earth at the last kind of Stalinist [[00:32:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1948.24s)]
*  dictatorship. It's a slightly different scenario, right? I mean, the fact that Brett McGurk is [[00:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1953.12s)]
*  saying this and some other people, Mark Rutte, the secretary general of NATO, who's sending Donald [[00:32:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1958.3999999999999s)]

*  most hilarious thing he's ever done. It was like this sycophantic message like we love you, President [[00:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1969.76s)]
*  Trump. But the reason they're saying this is that is that this is a moment to do it. I mean, can you [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1975.28s)]
*  imagine this this horrible regime that we've all been so afraid of, and rightfully so too, [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1980.0s)]

*  you know, American made Israeli plane. It's the time in which you do something like this or consider [[00:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=1993.92s)]
*  something like this, especially if the intelligence is saying as I tend to believe I don't have all [[00:33:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2000.72s)]
*  the evidence this I've talked to some people about it, Megan, I'm sure you have to that this was an [[00:33:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2007.76s)]
*  actual serious point. But when you do this, you have a thing that so many people Matt says I'm a [[00:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2011.92s)]
*  half peacenek. I think that's probably true. That's about a half peacenek. He sometimes loves war. [[00:33:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2018.8s)]
*  But Matt, the peacenek, the people who say blowback, this is something that you hear from the [[00:33:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2023.04s)]
*  noam chomskis of the world, people used to be just on the left, but you see here on the right to [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2028.32s)]
*  this is also blowback. Blowback is bi directional. They've been doing this for so long, [[00:33:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2032.72s)]
*  intimidating, attacking. Look, you can think that America shouldn't have been involved in the war [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2038.48s)]
*  in Iraq. I, unfortunately, and I criticize myself for this took too long to get to that conclusion, [[00:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2043.76s)]
*  but I did. And it was a bad thought that I had, but I was much younger. But regardless of whether [[00:34:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2049.44s)]
*  or not we should have been there, we do understand the Iranians killed 600 650 Americans. That's the [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2055.36s)]
*  kind of estimate through Iranian proxies that they were funding and arming roadside bombs that [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2061.52s)]
*  were built by the IRGC IRGC people on the ground in Iraq. Sulaimani also killed by Trump where [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2066.8s)]
*  in Iraq. I mean, so they've been fighting a direct war against us. Should we have been there? No, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2074.0s)]
*  we shouldn't have. But do we say because we shouldn't have been there, kill American troops [[00:34:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2079.7599999999998s)]
*  with abandoned hundreds of them. This is blowback. You guys got, you got, you know, [[00:34:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2084.4s)]
*  overstretched and you left yourself open and the Trump administration responded not by killing [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2090.88s)]
*  Iranians, not be killing Iranian scientists. The Israelis did that keep blowing up your nuclear [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2096.88s)]
*  program in various places. So you have around and eventually you found out, you know, to quote [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2102.2400000000002s)]
*  Colonel Jessup, you F with the wrong Marine. You know, you had Donald Trump in there. Joe Biden's [[00:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2108.88s)]
*  gone, right? It, we didn't have some feckless loser leader with no spine. He tried. He loves [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2115.2000000000003s)]
*  peace. He went Gazira, you know, and he looked at you folks in Iran and said, let's have a great [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2122.6400000000003s)]
*  relationship and stop all the killing. And then he started to realize as any dealmaker does at [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2128.1600000000003s)]
*  some point when he's getting stiffed, you know, when somebody's slow rolling you and doesn't really [[00:35:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2133.1200000000003s)]
*  mean to be there in good faith. And then he dropped a bomb on their nuclear facilities. That's how [[00:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2138.16s)]
*  it went down. Wanted to offer this. I didn't get to it yesterday. Um, but a guy named Jamie Metzel [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2141.7599999999998s)]
*  posted this. You mentioned Brett McGurk as follows quote, I served, this is on X. I served on the [[00:35:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2146.24s)]
*  national security council under president Clinton. I was Joe Biden's deputy staff director of the [[00:35:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2152.16s)]
*  Senate foreign relations committee. I voted for Kamala Harris and I've been a vocal critic of [[00:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2157.52s)]
*  many dangerous and undemocratic actions taken by president Trump, but I'm not a blind tribalist [[00:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2161.68s)]
*  and I'm perfectly comfortable praising president Trump for bold and courageous actions in support [[00:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2166.72s)]
*  of America's core national interests. As he took Saturday night, Iran has been at war with the [[00:36:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2170.8799999999997s)]
*  United States for 46 years. Its regime has murdered thousands of American citizens. Its slogan death [[00:36:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2175.7599999999998s)]
*  to America was not window dressing, but core ideology. It was racing towards a nuke with [[00:36:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2180.24s)]
*  every intention of using it to threaten America. Our allies are the middle East region as a whole, [[00:36:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2184.3999999999996s)]
*  blah, blah, blah, blah, blah. And then he goes on to say, although I believe electing Kamala would [[00:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2188.24s)]
*  have been better for our democracy society and economy, as well as for helping the most vulnerable [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2191.68s)]
*  people in the US and around the world, I also believe VP Harris would not have had the courage [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2195.92s)]
*  or fortitude to take such an essential step as the president took last night. Wow. I mean, [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2200.48s)]
*  it's remarkable. That's from an credit to him for saying it, Camille. And he might be right. And, [[00:36:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2206.96s)]
*  and you know, if I were trying to paint a alternative scenario here where the Trump [[00:36:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2212.7200000000003s)]
*  maybe achieves the same ends without necessarily having to carry out the military strike, [[00:36:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2219.44s)]
*  it would have involved him going to Congress very formally and and loudly and dramatically and [[00:37:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2224.16s)]
*  theatrically seeking authorization to use force and broadcasting to Iran very clearly. If we don't [[00:37:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2229.2799999999997s)]
*  get a deal, a deal where we get to come in, thoroughly expect these inspect these sites [[00:37:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2235.3599999999997s)]
*  with our personnel, then a strike is coming. But get congressional approval, do things the right [[00:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2240.16s)]
*  way. I'm not literally, I think that there's a possibility at least that you could have achieved [[00:37:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2247.44s)]
*  a very similar outcome. In fact, what would have been better is that you wouldn't have had to have [[00:37:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2253.92s)]
*  the expense of the bombing, but you'd also have the the knowledge of exactly what was in that [[00:37:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2257.44s)]
*  facility, and who was in the facility, and be able to go in there and dismantle things in a very [[00:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2262.56s)]
*  direct way. I mean, it's at least a possibility. But that is definitely different. And it's more [[00:37:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2269.12s)]
*  complicated. And it requires a lot of strategically that they might not have been able to pull off. [[00:37:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2275.36s)]
*  But at the same time, I do think that at least getting Congress involved in the decision is [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2281.52s)]
*  something that is worth flagging them for. But the outcome does seem quite good. Overall, [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2285.2799999999997s)]
*  Congress doesn't help with anything ever. Congress is the problem. Congress is not the solution [[00:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2291.12s)]
*  to anything and certainly not military action. Yes, if you're going to declare a war, you need [[00:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2297.2s)]
*  them. But the whole goal read John use piece over at National Review today. He's so smart. This guy [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2300.7999999999997s)]
*  has been so brilliant. Yes, he justified the torture under George W. Bush. But [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2306.24s)]
*  a little caveat about that, too. I'm sorry. Anyway, no, I'm fine with it. I defended the [[00:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2311.52s)]
*  torture when it was happening, too. We thought we were going to get attacked every next week. [[00:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2316.4799999999996s)]
*  We wanted to do anything necessary to protect ourselves and our children. It's like a fine to [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2320.0s)]
*  judge it now all these years later. But okay, anyway, John you has got a great piece up today [[00:38:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2323.6s)]
*  about the founding fathers and about Alexander Hamilton and about why they created the structure [[00:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2328.7999999999997s)]
*  they did with an emboldened executive who could make split second decisions, who could make in the [[00:38:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2335.6s)]
*  moment decisions on how to protect the homeland and how Congress, of course, is a much more [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2341.52s)]
*  deliberative body. And they understood that and that's got its place. But it's not when it comes [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2346.24s)]
*  to warfare in the moment, like where actual decisions need to be made and they need to be [[00:39:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2350.56s)]
*  made fast. That's why you have an executive who's commander in chief, too. He did not need to go to [[00:39:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2354.88s)]
*  Congress. You can argue about whether he should have. I still don't think he should have. Like if [[00:39:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2359.44s)]
*  you want to, whatever. Okay. But no, Congress fucks things up. They don't fix things. Sorry. Go ahead. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2362.48s)]
*  The Hamilton and Madison agreed on nothing. They didn't agree on what color the sky was, [[00:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2368.32s)]
*  but they both agreed that the power to declare war should rest in the Congress because they [[00:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2373.84s)]
*  didn't want to declare war. That's not what happened. We're now in the Obama 2011. Like, [[00:39:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2380.4s)]
*  it's just a kinetic military action. That's not a war. And I don't agree with that. [[00:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2387.68s)]
*  You really think we started a war with Iran? Is that what you think we did? [[00:39:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2391.6s)]
*  J.D. Pan said that we declared war on Iran's nuclear program, which is still a war. [[00:39:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2395.04s)]
*  Not on the Iranian people. Not on the country of Iran. It's different. It's not the same. [[00:40:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2400.16s)]
*  It's not exactly the same. It's narrower. You're doing a war like thing. [[00:40:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2406.3199999999997s)]
*  I totally disagree. I disagree with you. [[00:40:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2410.08s)]
*  And also, like, of course, there is the power invested in the president to respond to attacks. [[00:40:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2412.08s)]
*  This isn't a response to an attack. To prevent attacks. [[00:40:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2418.4s)]
*  The preventative attack. Yes, it is. But that's okay. [[00:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2421.2s)]
*  That's not like, oh, gosh, 24 hours is not enough time to notify anybody. [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2425.36s)]
*  It doesn't have to be imminent. Constitutionally, it does not need to be imminent. No, [[00:40:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2429.28s)]
*  it doesn't, Matt. What's your authority for that? [[00:40:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2433.52s)]
*  It's not my authority. It is for me. I think that when you say that you should, [[00:40:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2437.12s)]
*  I think the dropping of a bomb is an engagement in a war like activity. And if you're doing that, [[00:40:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2441.76s)]
*  you should be doing that in defense and not in preemption. [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2446.56s)]
*  So you're talking about should, not must. I mean, I'm trying to defend the president's power to do [[00:40:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2448.7999999999997s)]
*  what he did. There's no question as these people talk about impeachment, etc. [[00:40:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2453.52s)]
*  I think it's open to a legal challenge. It's utter folly. [[00:40:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2456.24s)]
*  It's the legal challenge that- He had 100% legal authority to do what he did. [[00:40:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2458.7999999999997s)]
*  My side would lose because successive Supreme Courts have given the president broad authority [[00:41:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2461.84s)]
*  in the war-making power, to be clear. But I think to look honestly at the intention of the [[00:41:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2467.6s)]
*  founders, including Alexander Hamilton, I don't think it was the president should have the ability [[00:41:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2473.36s)]
*  to go out and wage preemptive war farther along. They understood that having a president with that [[00:41:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2478.4s)]
*  much war-making power would be a temptation towards power and lead to more. And I think [[00:41:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2484.8s)]
*  we've lived through this over the last 25 years. He tried to prevent a war. That's what he did. [[00:41:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2488.96s)]
*  He dropped a bomb on a nuclear facility that could have killed us all with intel that they [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2494.0s)]
*  were ramping up and getting ready to use it. So I mean, like we can go around and around on this [[00:41:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2498.2400000000002s)]
*  all day, but number one, the AOC calls for impeachment, which Trump and she are arguing [[00:41:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2503.2s)]
*  back and forth on right now online, are absurd. There's zero grounds for impeachment. He's [[00:41:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2508.3199999999997s)]
*  taunting her now saying, go ahead and do it. Make my day. He's giving her one of those. [[00:41:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2513.68s)]
*  And I also think now, you know, and then we're spilling over into, okay, well, even if he had [[00:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2518.72s)]
*  the power, should he have exercised it? And we definitely have a disagreement on that, [[00:42:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2523.12s)]
*  but people can make up their own minds. I want to play you, I said I'd play the longer sound bite [[00:42:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2526.72s)]
*  of him dropping the bomb because he actually gets into a couple of other subjects. And I want to do [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2531.6s)]
*  that now. Here it is. I'm not happy that Israel is going out now. There was one rocket that I guess [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2535.12s)]
*  was fired overboard. It was after the time limit and it missed its target. And now Israel is going [[00:42:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2540.88s)]
*  out. These guys got to calm down. Ridiculous. I didn't like plenty of things I saw yesterday. [[00:42:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2548.4s)]
*  I didn't like the fact that Israel unloaded right after we made the deal. They didn't have to unload. [[00:42:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2553.44s)]
*  And I didn't like the fact that the retaliation was very strong. But in all fairness, Israel unloaded [[00:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2559.2s)]
*  a lot. And now I hear Israel just went out because they felt it was violated by one rocket that [[00:42:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2565.36s)]
*  didn't land anywhere. That's not what we want. I'll tell you. And I'm telling you, I'm not happy [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2571.6s)]
*  about that Israel either. I think they both violated it. I don't think they, I'm not sure [[00:42:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2576.08s)]
*  they did it intentionally. They couldn't rein people back. I don't like the fact that Israel [[00:43:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2580.88s)]
*  went out this morning at all. And I'm going to see if I can stop it. Yeah, I do. They violated it, [[00:43:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2585.44s)]
*  but Israel violated it too. Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a [[00:43:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2590.8s)]
*  load of bombs, the likes of which I've never seen before. The biggest load that we've seen. [[00:43:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2595.92s)]
*  I'm not happy with Israel. So I'm not happy with them. I'm not happy with Iran either. But I'm [[00:43:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2600.7200000000003s)]
*  really unhappy if Israel is going out this morning because the one rocket that didn't land, that was [[00:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2606.08s)]
*  shot perhaps by mistake, that didn't land. I'm not happy about that. [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2611.52s)]
*  You know what we have? We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and [[00:43:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2617.84s)]
*  so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing. Do you understand that? [[00:43:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2622.88s)]
*  Never gets out in the voice. There's always a good tell for him. [[00:43:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2630.32s)]
*  You're going to miss him when he's gone. I know this. [[00:43:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2634.08s)]
*  I love the classic Trump overstatement that the response was the biggest response. I've never [[00:43:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2637.28s)]
*  seen anything like it. It's like, well, it was just kind of a response. I'm not sure about that. [[00:44:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2643.2000000000003s)]
*  Can we just be clear on that point of hand? I just want to, because like my information, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2648.1600000000003s)]
*  this is what I think happened via Fox News and the New York Times. The ceasefire was about to [[00:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2651.92s)]
*  take hold. Five waves of missiles came at Israel before it had kicked in. One got through the [[00:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2656.1600000000003s)]
*  Israeli defenses and hit a target in an Israeli town called Beersheba. Then that's the one that [[00:44:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2662.48s)]
*  killed four people at least and injured 26 Israelis. After that missile strike, Israeli [[00:44:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2671.76s)]
*  fighter jets located the launchers that had launched those missiles over Iran and fired on [[00:44:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2677.2s)]
*  them. Now, so far, the ceasefire hasn't kicked in, so no one's violated it, though not a classy move [[00:44:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2683.04s)]
*  by Iran. Okay. Later, the ceasefire is four hours old and the IDF says two Iranian missiles [[00:44:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2689.44s)]
*  flew into the north of Israel, but that they were intercepted with no injuries. Iran is denying that [[00:44:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2697.04s)]
*  they were the ones who launched those missiles, but Israeli intel is usually pretty good on who's [[00:45:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2704.4s)]
*  firing the rockets at them. Okay. So I think when Trump says, and they dropped a bunch of bombs, [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2709.04s)]
*  I think he's talking, I don't know what he's talking about, to be honest, because what then [[00:45:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2716.7200000000003s)]
*  happened was Israel was flying a bunch of planes, according to the Trump tweets, in retaliation. I [[00:45:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2720.2400000000002s)]
*  think they were about to drop bombs and Trump sent out a bunch of tweets saying, you better not do [[00:45:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2728.8s)]
*  that. I don't want to see that. From Air Force One, he said he spoke to Netanyahu and he said he told [[00:45:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2733.84s)]
*  Netanyahu, bring back those military aircraft that Trump indicated were on the verge of attacking [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2741.92s)]
*  Iran. He also declared that the last thing on Iran's mind now is the nuclear weapon. And then [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2747.1200000000003s)]
*  you had a Trump tweet at 7.28 AM today saying, Israel is not going to attack Iran. All planes [[00:45:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2751.92s)]
*  will turn around and head home while doing a friendly plane wave to Iran. [[00:45:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2758.1600000000003s)]
*  Nobody will be hurt. The ceasefire is in effect. Thank you for your attention to this matter. [[00:46:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2765.6000000000004s)]
*  Donald J. Trump, President of the United States. Go ahead, Moynihan. [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2770.56s)]
*  Thank you for your attention to this matter. It's the greatest punctuation of that ever. [[00:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2774.16s)]
*  To what we were saying before, there's obviously some serious telegraphing going on here. God knows [[00:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2780.48s)]
*  what was said in that call between Trump and Netanyahu. We all know the relationship that [[00:46:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2785.36s)]
*  Obama and Netanyahu had, which was incredibly bad, particularly when Netanyahu came and addressed [[00:46:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2792.4s)]
*  Congress. It all sort of fell apart after that. It had already been tattered before. But the [[00:46:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2797.68s)]
*  relationship that the two of these guys have, we're going to wait for the reporting and for [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2804.3999999999996s)]
*  the historians in a couple of years on this because it seems not the easiest one. It seems [[00:46:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2808.56s)]
*  contentious because Trump is a huge personality and knows what he wants and usually gets it, [[00:46:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2813.2s)]
*  and particularly in foreign affairs. And so you see these people out there that drive me [[00:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2820.24s)]
*  absolutely bananas and say, oh, look, America's B2s are in the air. Israel controls American [[00:47:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2823.68s)]
*  foreign policy. Israel does not control American foreign policy. And this is, I think, not proof [[00:47:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2829.2s)]
*  of that in Trump saying, go turn around. If that happened, I imagine it's very likely that it did. [[00:47:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2835.2s)]
*  I do, though, very much disagree with the idea that, well, Iran did this, but Israel shouldn't [[00:47:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2841.6s)]
*  have responded. What the Israelis do is when they launch those missiles, and four people [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2847.6s)]
*  killed in Beersheba and buildings destroyed and lots of people grievously injured, too, [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2853.04s)]
*  is that they respond because they can very quickly target where those are coming from, [[00:47:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2859.52s)]
*  and then they blow up those missile launchers, which I think is a completely fair thing to do. [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2863.44s)]
*  So I think that what's happening here is Trump is rounding on the Israelis when it seems to me and [[00:47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2870.48s)]
*  to any observer, as you said, Fox, I read both the Fox and the New York Times account, Wall Street [[00:47:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2875.7599999999998s)]
*  Journal account of this, too, which seems like your telling of this from multiple sources seems [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2881.04s)]
*  to be what happened, that I think he's being not very charitable to the Israelis, but I suspect [[00:48:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2885.6s)]
*  there's something else going on here that we don't know about, that he's trying to put Netanyahu in [[00:48:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2890.0s)]
*  a very particular position. Maybe it's a broader thing. Again, this is total speculation, a broader [[00:48:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2896.48s)]
*  thing that, because they were resistance. Both sides were resistant to the ceasefire. It wasn't [[00:48:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2900.48s)]
*  as if everybody came to the table. They had a round of negotiations in UAE or Oman or something. [[00:48:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2904.56s)]
*  This was kind of a diktat from Trump. So there might be some sort of difficulty about what this [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2909.52s)]
*  entails. And this is him firing a warning shot at the Israelis, because when it comes to how they [[00:48:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2914.72s)]
*  responded, I don't think they responded in an unreasonable way at all. Yeah, when he says they [[00:48:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2921.52s)]
*  came out Israel, as soon as we made the deal, they came out and they dropped a load of bombs, [[00:48:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2926.4s)]
*  the like us of which I've never seen before the biggest load we've seen. I'm not happy with Israel. [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2930.88s)]
*  I don't know what he's talking about, because what Israel did was they responded to the one that had [[00:48:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2936.08s)]
*  been launched in Be'er Sheva and in the way that we just discussed. And then they were about to [[00:49:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2941.12s)]
*  respond to the possibly errant, being very charitable, two missiles that had been intercepted [[00:49:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2949.36s)]
*  post ceasefire. But then Trump said they didn't actually do it. He got the planes to turn around [[00:49:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2956.24s)]
*  after his conversation with Bibi. So, I mean, I don't exactly know what Trump is referring to [[00:49:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2961.2s)]
*  there. But I'll say this, I have 28 seconds till the break. Last night, you know, we do AM Update, [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2965.6s)]
*  the morning podcast that we drop, it's just news headlines for the audience. And we, I mean, we [[00:49:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2971.2s)]
*  went back and forth hour after hour, we met again to update AM Update, because it was like, the [[00:49:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2976.3199999999997s)]
*  Iranians agree there's a ceasefire. The Iranians just told CNN there is no ceasefire. Oh, wait, no, [[00:49:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2981.2s)]
*  they say there is a ceasefire. All the Iranian TV is reporting there's no ceasefire. It was like, [[00:49:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2986.24s)]
*  oh my God, then we put it to bed, there is a ceasefire. We wake up, of course, it's like, [[00:49:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2990.4s)]
*  everyone's violated the ceasefire. Okay. So it's not going that well. All right, [[00:49:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2994.24s)]
*  standby. Got to take a quick break. The guys are with us for the full show. [[00:49:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=2998.0s)]
*  These days, it feels like everyone has an agenda, the media, big tech. But let me tell you about [[00:50:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3004.48s)]
*  ground news. They do not filter the news. They show how stories are being shaped, spun or ignored [[00:50:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3009.6s)]
*  entirely. So you can decide what to believe. Ground News is an independent app and website [[00:50:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3015.12s)]
*  built to give users control over their newsfeed. It aggregates coverage from across the political [[00:50:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3021.36s)]
*  spectrum and breaks down how each outlet is framing the story, including bias ownership [[00:50:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3026.08s)]
*  and what key details might be missing. If you're tired of being told what matters or what doesn't, [[00:50:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3030.4s)]
*  it might be time to take the power back. Ground News is offering 40% off their unlimited access [[00:50:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3035.36s)]
*  vantage plan for a limited time. This offer is available exclusively at groundnews.com. [[00:50:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3040.2400000000002s)]
*  Don't let anyone else decide what you get to see. Take back control of your newsfeed today. [[00:50:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3045.36s)]
*  So guys, Emily Jushinsky launched her MK media show last night after party with Emily, [[00:50:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3058.1600000000003s)]
*  which has like a fun bonus of sounding kind of naughty. But it's totally above board. [[00:51:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3064.96s)]
*  Anyway, she launched it last night. It's live on YouTube at 10pm, two nights a week. And her [[00:51:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3072.0800000000004s)]
*  inaugural guest was Tucker Carlson. And it's a great time to get Tucker Carlson. Of course, [[00:51:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3078.5600000000004s)]
*  he's in the news every day because he's in the interesting position of being one of Trump's [[00:51:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3084.2400000000002s)]
*  main supporters. And yet very, very critical of really all war, but this one, yes, including, [[00:51:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3088.8s)]
*  and had tried to talk Trump out of it to the point where Trump, when I was on vacation last week, [[00:51:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3096.56s)]
*  referred to him as kooky, Tucker Carlson, and then made a shot of like, well, if he's going to credit [[00:51:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3102.0s)]
*  if he had something like, what does he have to say? He should, he should go buy a television [[00:51:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3108.32s)]
*  network. So somebody would listen to him. Maybe somebody would listen to him. Something like [[00:51:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3112.4s)]
*  very cutting. I was like, whoa. And then they talked and Trump says Tucker apologized to him [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3115.84s)]
*  for going a little hard on him. And so I don't know what exactly happened. I haven't spoken to [[00:52:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3124.16s)]
*  either one of them. But Tucker's been under a lot of fire from people who now say, and on top of [[00:52:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3129.04s)]
*  all that, you were wrong because Trump nailed it. And so all your doom and gloom predictions were [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3135.2000000000003s)]
*  wrong. But again, like, just don't make predictions either way in the Middle East. Like, don't say his [[00:52:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3140.08s)]
*  doom and gloom predictions were wrong. It's only been about two minutes and don't, don't say they [[00:52:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3144.56s)]
*  were right. Like, let's just, just don't predict anything in the Middle East. Like, that's, that's [[00:52:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3150.64s)]
*  a golden rule. Anyway, he went on with Emily and they had a couple of interesting discussions. Let [[00:52:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3155.6s)]
*  me give you the overall, in which he responded to some of the attacks he's been facing from guys like [[00:52:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3162.16s)]
*  he had an extraordinary interview with Ted Cruz, which I highly recommend you listen to very [[00:52:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3168.16s)]
*  entertaining on a number of levels. And he's been fighting with Mark Levin of Fox News. Anyway, [[00:52:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3171.3599999999997s)]
*  take a listen to South 11. I don't really care what people think of me at this point. I'm 56. [[00:52:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3177.12s)]
*  You were wrong. Well, yeah, I've been wrong many, many times. I'll be wrong many, many more times. [[00:53:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3182.24s)]
*  But the one thing I am is sincere. I really mean it. I don't care about the effect on me. I just, [[00:53:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3187.8399999999997s)]
*  I don't want to relive Iraq. And I know the people who did it. I lived among them. I defended it. I [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3192.72s)]
*  repeated their talking points. Not doing that again. And we came really close to doing that again, [[00:53:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3198.0s)]
*  because of Mark Levin and Laura Loomer and the rest of these morons who've never even left New [[00:53:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3202.16s)]
*  Jersey. Like they don't know anything about the world. That's the other thing. They're dumb. [[00:53:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3206.56s)]
*  They don't know. They don't know the population of Iran. They don't know anything. They don't [[00:53:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3209.44s)]
*  know the nations that border it. They just don't know anything. And I'm not making an argument for [[00:53:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3214.0s)]
*  expertise or having been there, but I am making an argument for being responsible. When you demand [[00:53:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3219.12s)]
*  that the US military do certain things, because we were just in a crisis for a week, we saw who [[00:53:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3226.0s)]
*  people are, we saw what they cared about. And I've got nothing against Ted Cruz personally, [[00:53:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3230.96s)]
*  sorry for Ted Cruz, obviously a totally hollow person taking instructions, but I do think we [[00:53:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3236.24s)]
*  learned this is not someone who should be influencing wars because he just doesn't know [[00:54:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3241.84s)]
*  anything. He doesn't care. And he's not putting America's interests anywhere near the top of his [[00:54:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3248.08s)]
*  priorities. Okay. So that's, that's talk on Ted Cruz, by the way, she, she, she's on a 10 PM on [[00:54:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3253.68s)]
*  Mondays and Wednesdays. So you can check her out tomorrow night. She's got Rand Paul, who's one of [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3263.6s)]
*  the detractors that the president's seeing on this front in the US Senate. So what do you make of [[00:54:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3268.4s)]
*  what's unfolded within the Republican party over the past 10 days or so? I just think it's really, [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3273.6s)]
*  you know, it's kind of a low blow from Tucker to assume that Ted Cruz has dual loyalty with Canada, [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3280.56s)]
*  just because a guy is born there, doesn't really mean taking instructions in the great white north. [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3285.2799999999997s)]
*  I'm 56 to Tucker and I don't care what anybody thinks either. And also I had done what he did in [[00:54:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3290.16s)]
*  Moscow. I wouldn't be telling people like, like using people of not having been to a place [[00:54:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3299.92s)]
*  very, very, [[00:55:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3305.2799999999997s)]
*  the grocery store, Moynihan will point, will point. Yeah. The grocery store that the subway is the [[00:55:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3307.44s)]
*  cleanest in the world. It makes you feel like America's dirty and bad. Russia is bigger than [[00:55:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3313.52s)]
*  the nicest the grocery store in Moscow. And also there's compared dollar. There's just a whole bunch [[00:55:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3319.36s)]
*  of stone obvious things that you could have learned from his father. I do. I've got to just say quickly, [[00:55:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3325.52s)]
*  I'm going to give you back. I just flying in a JFK on the way home. It's a, it's Calcutta. [[00:55:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3330.0s)]
*  It's disgusting. It's why are we so bad at this? Sorry, go ahead. No, Moynihan will, [[00:55:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3335.44s)]
*  we'll tell the story about Steve Bannon that I think is interesting. My, I think the bottom [[00:55:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3343.36s)]
*  line is that Trump is correct when he says, at least as a matter of politics, that MAGA is what [[00:55:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3346.72s)]
*  is whatever he says it is. It's not whatever Tucker Carlson says. I'm actually heartened [[00:55:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3352.08s)]
*  that some people like Tucker, even though I disagree with him about many, many things, [[00:55:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3356.64s)]
*  I enjoyed his Ted Cruz interview. You're right. People should seek it out. Like the exchanges [[00:56:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3361.3599999999997s)]
*  were valuable as was just the spirit of them on both sides. Like just going at each other, [[00:56:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3365.52s)]
*  there should be more exchanges like that. I think it was a useful thing. But, and I'm heartened that [[00:56:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3370.72s)]
*  there are people who have been MAGA who are, who are bummed out by this use of US military force, [[00:56:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3375.36s)]
*  at least they're hewing to some amount of principle. I think among the broader pro-Trump [[00:56:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3382.88s)]
*  and also Republican electorate, I think Trump will be broadly correct as a matter of politics. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3387.52s)]
*  But I know Moynihan has been following Steve Bannon on this, among other things for a while. [[00:56:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3391.44s)]
*  Well, I like what you said. I think, I think that's right too. I think it's, it's to Tucker's credit [[00:56:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3395.28s)]
*  that he didn't abandon what appears to be a sincerely held belief of his just because his [[00:56:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3399.28s)]
*  friend got elected. He voted for him and wanted it and disagrees with him on this. Like it would be [[00:56:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3403.44s)]
*  worse if he just suddenly said, okay, all that stuff I was saying, forget about it. Like that [[00:56:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3409.36s)]
*  would be, that would be odd. Which we've seen a lot of this week as well. Yeah, we absolutely have. [[00:56:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3414.0s)]
*  I mean, look, I can, I understand the Tulseys of the world and the JD Vances of the world, [[00:56:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3418.88s)]
*  who I think probably secretly share Tucker's beliefs, going along because they, they're in [[00:57:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3423.76s)]
*  the administration. Like there's no option. You can't be out there as the vice president being like, [[00:57:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3429.84s)]
*  this is so wrong. God, this is, like, that would be absolutely foolheaded. But anyway, go ahead, [[00:57:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3434.7200000000003s)]
*  go ahead, Moynihan. I want to hear your Steve points. Yeah, I think that's, I think that's right. I think [[00:57:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3439.76s)]
*  that JD Vance probably is much closer to Tucker than he's letting on. I think that also those [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3442.8s)]
*  people in the MAGA universe as commentators and people who make a good deal of money off of it, [[00:57:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3448.96s)]
*  a lot of them, no naming any names, have softened their very isolationist rhetoric when Trump [[00:57:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3455.12s)]
*  did this and said, well, oh, I guess he must be right. I think a lot of it's about, about [[00:57:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3462.64s)]
*  audience capture. But I will agree with Matt and I disagree with Tucker on a lot of things, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3466.4s)]
*  almost everything these days. But I do appreciate the fact that he doesn't back down and say, well, [[00:57:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3473.3599999999997s)]
*  you know, MAGA is MAGA and he's the one, as he said, who decides MAGA. So I'm going to, I'm going [[00:57:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3478.96s)]
*  to carry water for whatever he does. I think he's wrong. I love the fact that Tucker's always like, [[00:58:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3482.96s)]
*  Ted Cruz is, and it doesn't matter who it is, like Ted Cruz is a nice guy. He's a, you know, [[00:58:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3488.32s)]
*  hollow-eyed devil who's an idiot. But like, it's how he does it. He's a friend of mine. He's like [[00:58:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3492.08s)]
*  Jeffrey Epstein and probably a Nazi, but whatever. People have their friends. No, he didn't say that. [[00:58:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3501.84s)]
*  I said that. But like, and also like Matt, I think that it was a good interview because when [[00:58:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3507.36s)]
*  Tucker's, the problem with Tucker show has been, it's been so many people since he left Fox. It's [[00:58:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3515.52s)]
*  just been kind of an echo chamber of this is what I think MAGA should be. This is kind of my version [[00:58:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3522.6400000000003s)]
*  of the MAGA ideology. And it's a bit of an echo chamber. So to see him in that combative role, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3527.6s)]
*  I don't want to ever agree with Ted Cruz. I'm not a fan of his at all. But also I think that it was [[00:58:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3533.2s)]
*  actually people had that interview a bit wrong because the clip that was played and they put it [[00:58:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3537.92s)]
*  out before where Ted Cruz didn't know the exact pop or he didn't, he didn't offer any population [[00:59:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3542.72s)]
*  number. I think you, by the way, you can say that Iran shouldn't have a nuclear bomb and think they [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3548.16s)]
*  have 50 million people rather than 92 million people. I don't think it's the real knockout punch [[00:59:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3552.56s)]
*  that people thought it was, but the entire interview was actually quite good. I mean, they, they gave it [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3557.12s)]
*  as good to each other. It was very hostile in certain places. It was certainly very enlightening [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3562.0s)]
*  and I encouraged Tucker to do more of those in fewer people he agrees with because I get kind [[00:59:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3566.08s)]
*  of bored by the echo chamber stuff and I think he's very, very good when he's debating people. [[00:59:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3571.84s)]
*  So, but it's very funny to listen to him be like, you know, oh, oh, really? That's your thing. And [[00:59:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3576.8s)]
*  then Ted Cruz goes a little less snark and Tucker was kind of charming of both ends. [[00:59:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3581.2s)]
*  Yeah, I was like sitting across from somebody and like fighting in a restaurant. I was like, oh, [[00:59:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3589.8399999999997s)]
*  this is getting interesting now. Listen. But the thing about it, I think is also this fracturing [[00:59:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3593.2799999999997s)]
*  of the, the MAGA movement is if you look at Donald Trump's true social feed in the past 24 hours, [[00:59:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3598.16s)]
*  you would, you would see somebody who most of people, these people, including Tucker would [[01:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3604.48s)]
*  probably call a neocon. I mean, he was posting. Did you see what just just my producers just sent [[01:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3609.04s)]
*  this to me, including Jeb Bush? Yes. Jeb Bush put out a tweet saying president Trump's decision to [[01:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3614.48s)]
*  neutralize Iran's regimes. Nuclear program is a watershed moment. It reasserts us strength, [[01:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3625.84s)]
*  restores deterrence, sends an unmistakable message to rogue regimes. The era of impunity is over. [[01:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3630.4s)]
*  My full statement here. And then Trump retweeted it saying thank you to Jeb Bush. Very much [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3636.0s)]
*  appreciated, which is like, if some of you out there listening and Megan Kelly land or getting [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3641.84s)]
*  your political education, don't remember 2016 go watch those exchanges between Donald Trump and Jeb [[01:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3650.0s)]
*  Bush where he is absolutely hammering him, particularly on the Iraq war and his brother. [[01:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3655.84s)]
*  But this is the interesting thing about Trump. No one should be surprised by this. Who in Trump's [[01:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3660.6400000000003s)]
*  cabinet first time around this time around has not, including JD Vance called him like Hitler. And he [[01:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3665.2000000000003s)]
*  does not care. He's like, if you're on my side now, great. He does not. I mean, one of his great [[01:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3671.28s)]
*  qualities is that he doesn't hold these endless grudges, which I think is pretty, pretty fascinating. [[01:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3676.0s)]
*  But he also tweeted this guy, this young American Jewish Instagram stars, like a pro Israel guy, [[01:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3681.76s)]
*  like humiliating this woman in a kaffir at like a pro Palestine protest. That's something that you [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3690.1600000000003s)]
*  would be like, you know, I know, Megan, you you listen to skeptically listen to and like the guys [[01:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3696.32s)]
*  at the commentary podcast. That's something that those guys would would retweet. And I saw that on [[01:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3700.56s)]
*  Trump's truth social today. There's a lot of stuff there that if you took that from all the people [[01:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3705.2s)]
*  who have been trying to direct MAGA like this, I think in one final thing not to go on too long, [[01:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3710.24s)]
*  but there's there's two types of this. There's people who believe this is what MAGA is. And [[01:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3714.7999999999997s)]
*  there are people who are trying to direct MAGA. I think that's what Trump does what Tucker does. [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3719.68s)]
*  But there's a lot of people that say like, oh, he never, you know, no foreign wars. That's not what [[01:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3724.72s)]
*  he's interested in. It's like, I think that's a fundamental misunderstanding of Trump and how Trump [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3728.72s)]
*  views American power. He does not want to start new foreign wars. He does not want an Iraq situation. [[01:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3734.9599999999996s)]
*  But that does not mean that he's going to, you know, let's dismantle the B2s. Let's put all this [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3740.64s)]
*  stuff away. We don't need it. We have no business anywhere in the world. That's not how he sees the [[01:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3744.64s)]
*  world. In the first administration, they went after Syria, they 75 Tomahawk missiles into Syria. Yeah, [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3748.48s)]
*  it wasn't a huge war. But this was not this was not some, you know, peacenik. They killed [[01:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3754.64s)]
*  Soleimani. And that was at the same time going to usher in the hell that all these people expected. [[01:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3759.2799999999997s)]
*  I mean, Tucker said that this might and again, we have to wait. And they said this will probably [[01:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3764.96s)]
*  result in thousands of American deaths. So I mean, I think Tucker is trying to directionally push [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3768.64s)]
*  MAGA somewhere. And I think he's had some success at that. But it kind of falling apart at the [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3775.04s)]
*  moment. And I think that there's other people who believe that MAGA has always been a kind of [[01:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3778.96s)]
*  Lindbergh, taft, old school Republican isolationism, which it isn't. It just simply isn't the evidence [[01:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3783.76s)]
*  doesn't show that. I have to say, I know Tucker's against what's happening in the Middle East right [[01:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3789.6800000000003s)]
*  now. And I understand it. He he was right about Ukraine. Tucker was right about Ukraine. He took [[01:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3794.8s)]
*  a lot of heat. That war has been lost for a long time. It's been stuck in this unsolvable [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3800.1600000000003s)]
*  and intransigence and it needs to be ended. Trump's not wrong. There's just so much death [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3806.32s)]
*  on both sides. It just we need to admit reality. I know you guys may feel differently, but I think [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3811.52s)]
*  Tucker was right about Ukraine deserves. Yeah, but I think he deserves a fair listen on his predictions, [[01:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3816.88s)]
*  though, again, don't make predictions about the Middle East because just as folly for anybody. [[01:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3823.28s)]
*  What do you guys make of it? Because it's not just Tucker. He's now worrying with Laura Loomer, [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3826.32s)]
*  who's you know, she's been out there attacking him and he fought back. But Tucker and Levin are really, [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3831.2000000000003s)]
*  really going at it. He's both as good as they get it. And that is like, and then then they both, [[01:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3838.9599999999996s)]
*  not only do they argue their points when it comes to Israel, then they both one up each other on [[01:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3845.7599999999998s)]
*  whether they actually love Trump. You know, like Levin's bringing up those texts that were unearthed [[01:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3851.3599999999997s)]
*  from Tucker that he sent somebody within Fox News after the election last in 2020 when he lost, [[01:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3857.4399999999996s)]
*  saying I can't stand Trump and I can't wait until we can't we don't have to talk about him every [[01:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3864.3199999999997s)]
*  night, something for which I think Tucker did apologize to Trump. They made up. They definitely [[01:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3867.44s)]
*  talk about talked about those texts and talk and Tucker explained them and Trump was fine with [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3870.88s)]
*  everything anyway. You know, you can see these two factions of the Republican Party, Matt really [[01:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3874.08s)]
*  fighting and the one that thought it had Trump is not winning. And the ones who hated Trump and were [[01:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3878.96s)]
*  brought along kicking and screaming to vote for him over Kamala Harris are doing okay. They've had [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3888.16s)]
*  a couple setbacks. They'd like regime change, but they're I mean, I heard my friends over at [[01:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3894.24s)]
*  National Review praising Trump in a way I and commentary to I, I try to get my news from [[01:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3899.12s)]
*  everybody. So I have all sides represented and it's been amazing to hear like the more dejected side [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3905.6s)]
*  that thought they had Trump as their isolationist buddy in their tone. And then like the guys at [[01:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3912.16s)]
*  commentary like cotton Eddie, he's on the carpet. Like there's very elated Rich Lowry who I love. [[01:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3917.4399999999996s)]
*  He's actually been fair to Trump, but he has a piece right now up on National Review called [[01:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3922.96s)]
*  president bad. Something's happening. Let's remember though that, you know, this is the same Trump who [[01:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3926.48s)]
*  was it two months ago. We certainly talked about on the show with you, Megan was in Saudi Arabia [[01:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3934.64s)]
*  and he gave a speech that that exact same crew, the continent, he a wing was not so happy with [[01:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3939.52s)]
*  where he called neo cons out by name on foreign soil in Saudi Arabia, which I think last time I [[01:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3946.08s)]
*  looked was the country from which 15 of the 19 hijackers on 9 11 came from. And he used that [[01:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3951.84s)]
*  as an opportunity to denounce the Bush family and the neo con wars and the nation building and all [[01:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3958.6400000000003s)]
*  of this and saying that we are not sitting in judgment of all of you, we just want peace and [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3962.88s)]
*  etc. So there is always, you know, it's the whims of one very politically talented and interesting [[01:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3966.1600000000003s)]
*  person. But when you when you when you do what you kind of understandably want to make it, which is [[01:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3973.84s)]
*  to tell Congress to go take a long walk off a short pier, you end up with one man deciding [[01:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3979.52s)]
*  what things are and that man's the decider, depending on depending on who he last talked to. [[01:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3985.2000000000003s)]
*  So yes, it's a good day to be a artist formerly known as a neo con. But I predict that in the [[01:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3991.52s)]
*  sooner rather than later future, that group of people, there's not going to be a lot of Jeb [[01:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=3999.28s)]
*  exclamation point now in favor of Trump as he drops more bombs at Bibi Netanyahu, as he says, [[01:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4004.3999999999996s)]
*  look, this ceasefire is the most important thing, which is not what the most important thing is for [[01:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4011.3599999999997s)]
*  Israel at all. As they figure out who gets to control the airspace under what terms, what [[01:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4015.52s)]
*  America is going to allow and not allow in terms of the use of the American supplied weapons and [[01:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4021.4399999999996s)]
*  network systems, which, you know, Israel needs American tacit support for. I think we're going [[01:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4026.3999999999996s)]
*  to be seeing a lot of different versions of what Trump's Middle East foreign policy is going to be [[01:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4032.56s)]
*  and pushing expanding the Abraham Accords into countries and doing, you know, making deals with [[01:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4038.32s)]
*  countries in order to do that. And I think the Abraham Accords was a great triumph in his [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4044.08s)]
*  in his first administration among the handful of the best things that happened under him. [[01:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4047.92s)]
*  So what does it mean now? Who gets next? And under what conditions? What is it? What kind of deals [[01:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4052.4s)]
*  are America is America going to do with Saudi Arabia to get them into the Abraham Accords? [[01:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4057.12s)]
*  I think Commentary magazine might not be as stoked a couple of months. They might not love that. Yeah. [[01:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4061.28s)]
*  So you say they're going to be upset as he drops more F bombs on Netanyahu and the corollary is [[01:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4066.0s)]
*  fewer actual bombs on Iran. So that's probably the future. Camille, what do you make of it? [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4071.6800000000003s)]
*  Because I do think the internal war on the right is interesting. Of course, the left is loving it. [[01:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4077.36s)]
*  They're bathing in it. They're rubbing it all over themselves. They love the war. I don't know. I [[01:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4083.6800000000003s)]
*  think it's healthy to have these these debates. I don't think they need to get super personal and [[01:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4088.64s)]
*  nasty. I'm not sure why they always have a tendency to do that. But I find it really fascinating to [[01:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4092.64s)]
*  listen to the different positions. I would look there's always a few exceptions who are just [[01:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4098.5599999999995s)]
*  nutcases or out there saying like, you should be impeached over this. And then there's the people [[01:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4102.96s)]
*  who always go to how evil the Jews are. Like those people I just write off and I try not to even [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4108.32s)]
*  mention them. It's not worth it. But like mainstream smart invested America loving commentators [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4112.64s)]
*  are interesting to me. You know, they're interesting to me. And I think we're learning from [[01:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4119.280000000001s)]
*  like the Tucker Ted debate, the Tucker Levin debate now. And some of the back and forth we've seen on [[01:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4123.04s)]
*  X from lesser known players, but probably everybody who you know, everybody on this screen knows. [[01:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4130.400000000001s)]
*  Yeah, I think since the beginning of this administration, there's always been a lot [[01:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4135.6s)]
*  of questions about how this very diverse cast of characters manages to get along with each other [[01:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4138.96s)]
*  over the long run. And we certainly saw a lot of this consternation around the Elon Musk fallout, [[01:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4144.4800000000005s)]
*  and the just broader kind of tech bro faction of MAGA, which is a third kind of element of [[01:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4151.76s)]
*  this story that a moment ago, we were talking a lot about that things quieted down. And now we have [[01:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4156.8s)]
*  the kind of foreign policy tensions that have that have come to the forefront. As as Welch pointed [[01:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4161.84s)]
*  out, the fact that the president can give a speech that seems to point in one clear direction, [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4168.08s)]
*  and then take an action that points in what seems to be the polar opposite direction, [[01:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4173.44s)]
*  makes it hard for any of these factions to think that they own him completely. It probably does, [[01:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4178.48s)]
*  I think, make people a little more reluctant to imagine that they can push the cart in one [[01:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4183.44s)]
*  direction or another. So it'll be interesting to see if there's another opportunity for, [[01:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4189.6s)]
*  say, Tucker Carlson to have to take a position publicly, that is in sort of strident opposition [[01:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4193.44s)]
*  to the president. I think a lot of Republicans have kind of had to hold their nose while supporting [[01:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4199.12s)]
*  certain things like the great big, beautiful bill, which, you know, is supposed to curtail spending, [[01:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4203.919999999999s)]
*  but also contains a hell of a lot of spending, it doesn't really seem to be curtailing it. [[01:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4207.919999999999s)]
*  It's been interesting to see how they've had to navigate all of these different tensions, [[01:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4212.639999999999s)]
*  and how they've managed to survive them unscathed. Certainly, if the current circumstance with [[01:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4216.719999999999s)]
*  Iran and Israel, if that manages to hold, that's great. It certainly seems like we've kind of [[01:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4223.44s)]
*  insulated ourselves from any kind of potential fallout from the strike, at least in the short [[01:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4228.48s)]
*  run. But had things been protracted a bit longer, had there been more looming questions about [[01:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4233.679999999999s)]
*  whether or not the United States would get more deeply involved, then perhaps there'd be even [[01:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4240.879999999999s)]
*  more tension. But at the moment, they seem to be weathering this storm, and the folks are falling [[01:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4245.759999999999s)]
*  back in line. And I suspect that'll probably continue to be the case, irrespective of what [[01:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4251.12s)]
*  happens going forward. Well, we'll see. I'm sure they'll be pulling out any day now on how Trump's [[01:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4256.4s)]
*  doing. Going into this, like last Friday, he was, I think, at 56%. He's crushing it in the polls [[01:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4260.96s)]
*  right now. Higher than Obama was at this point in his term, definitely higher than Biden. His [[01:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4267.28s)]
*  approval ratings have been extremely strong, higher than they ever were for Trump. We'll see [[01:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4272.32s)]
*  whether this has increased or decreased the numbers. I think it's going to increase, even [[01:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4276.48s)]
*  though people are not in favor of war with Iran and in advance of the dropping of the bomb, we're [[01:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4281.12s)]
*  not in favor of dropping the bomb. But Trump is so transparent about everything. I think it's going [[01:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4286.799999999999s)]
*  to go well. I just want to say one other thing. The Jeb Bush thing is, I have a personal connection [[01:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4292.5599999999995s)]
*  to this, because when he was running for president against Trump in 1516, he gave me his first [[01:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4298.32s)]
*  interview. I believe we were at Liberty University. We sat down and I asked him, [[01:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4305.28s)]
*  knowing what we know now, would you have authorized the invasion of Iraq like your brother did? [[01:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4313.36s)]
*  He said yes and didn't say that it was a mistake. Many people would later say, [[01:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4320.24s)]
*  at that point, his candidacy was killed in its crib because that was the wrong answer by 2016. [[01:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4330.72s)]
*  It was very clear to most Americans by 2016 that the Iraq war was a mistake and that it shouldn't [[01:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4338.160000000001s)]
*  have been undertaken anyway. So then he went out on the presidential debate stage and Trump, [[01:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4343.68s)]
*  this outsider, comes in from nowhere and starts hammering him on it. You couldn't say it was a [[01:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4348.400000000001s)]
*  mistake. It was an obvious mistake. Jeb Bush was really caught there because he'd given me [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4356.0s)]
*  that terrible answer, which he tried to clarify a couple of days later saying he'd misunderstood me, [[01:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4360.64s)]
*  even though the question was super clear. It's his brother's war, so he doesn't want to throw him [[01:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4364.72s)]
*  under the bus. It's Trump, so no one wanted to bend the knee to him and say this outside weird [[01:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4369.04s)]
*  guy with the weird hair, he's right and I'm wrong and my brother was wrong. So it was totally fraught [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4373.12s)]
*  and that really helped propel Donald Trump, that debate and him hammering Jeb Bush straight to the [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4378.8s)]
*  nomination and then the presidency. So it is kind of a remarkable full circle moment now to see Jeb [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4383.92s)]
*  Bush praising Trump for an aggressive military action in the Middle East and Trump accepting [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4388.64s)]
*  the compliment and sort of glad handing with now what is clearly a high energy Jeb. [[01:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4396.24s)]
*  – And where was that debate? It's important to point out. It was in South Carolina, a big military [[01:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4401.84s)]
*  state of all places to go after the Bush family, to go after John McCain. You're going to do it in [[01:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4407.92s)]
*  South Carolina and Trump said yes, f-yes. – We've got to drop for the podcast guys, [[01:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4412.8s)]
*  let's drop in a sound bite of that debate. Sorry for my serious ex-M listeners, we don't have it [[01:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4419.360000000001s)]
*  at the ready. – Obviously the war in Iraq was a big fat mistake, all right? Now you can take it [[01:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4422.96s)]
*  anywhere you want and it took Jeb Bush, if you remember at the beginning of his announcement, [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4429.92s)]
*  when he announced the president, it took him five days, he went back, it was a mistake, it wasn't a [[01:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4435.360000000001s)]
*  mistake, it took him five days before his people told him what to say and he ultimately said it was [[01:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4440.24s)]
*  a mistake. The war in Iraq, we spent two trillion dollars, thousands of lives, we don't even have it, [[01:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4446.48s)]
*  Iran is taking over Iraq with the second largest oil reserves in the world. Obviously it was a mistake. [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4452.32s)]
*  – I could care less about the insults that Donald Trump gives to me. It's blood sport for him, [[01:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4458.16s)]
*  he enjoys it and I'm glad he's happy about it. But I am sick and tired of him going after my family. [[01:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4463.12s)]
*  While Donald Trump was building a reality TV show, my brother was building a security [[01:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4470.24s)]
*  apparatus to keep us safe and I'm proud of what he did. He's had the gall to go after my mother. [[01:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4476.08s)]
*  – The World Trade Center came down during your brother's reign, remember that. [[01:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4487.44s)]
*  – He's had the gall to go after my mother. – That's not keeping us safe. [[01:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4489.44s)]
*  – Go ahead Michael. – I think that one of the things that [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4490.96s)]
*  annoyed me most about some of these debates is the endless stupid use of the word neocon, [[01:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4495.52s)]
*  which suggests that anyone who wants to have any military action or any military [[01:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4502.72s)]
*  response to anything is a neocon. – Loves war. [[01:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4507.52s)]
*  – Or like a warmonger or the, when Tucker's I really disagree with him, that Mark Levin enjoys [[01:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4511.6s)]
*  when people blow up. That's what his guiding ideology is, watching people die in the battlefield. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4518.96s)]
*  I think that this is both crazy and wrong and I also think that Trump acknowledges that. He [[01:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4525.28s)]
*  can go to Saudi Arabia and denounce neocons and neoconservatives and do what he did in Iran and [[01:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4531.44s)]
*  actually keep those two thoughts in his head at the same time. Mostly because when Tucker is on [[01:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4539.36s)]
*  Emily's show, and congratulations to Emily who's great on her new show and everyone should watch [[01:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4544.8s)]
*  and listen, I think that the thing that's when he brings up Iraq, much of the way Matt did earlier [[01:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4548.88s)]
*  and I did too, is that yeah there's lessons to be learned from that, a million lessons to be learned [[01:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4554.64s)]
*  from that, but I think that how Trump sees foreign policy as a neocon thing or not a neocon thing, [[01:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4559.76s)]
*  this specific thing, and again you don't want to get into a boring definitional argument about what [[01:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4566.4800000000005s)]
*  a neoconservative is, but it's that we can come in and create democracy. We can install things that [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4570.32s)]
*  people are just desperate and waiting for democratic institutions to be created by the Americans. What [[01:16:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4578.16s)]
*  Donald Trump is saying in Iran is that we're going to blow up your nuclear facilities that are [[01:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4583.36s)]
*  in Fordow under a mountain. We're not going to go in there and try to create a new parliament. We're [[01:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4589.04s)]
*  not going to try to come in and create elections. I think that's a very, very distinct and different thing. [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4594.16s)]
*  We don't want to stay. We don't want to stay. We don't want to be there at all. I mean so [[01:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4597.84s)]
*  the boots on the ground is the thing that Iraq is all about. There's no threat. I think there's a [[01:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4602.0s)]
*  zero percent chance of boots on the ground in Iran. Americans totally agree. Nobody, no Americans [[01:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4608.16s)]
*  would, I mean as you pointed out, it's such an important thing to point out. The polling suggests [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4614.400000000001s)]
*  that people weren't psyched about this, mostly because there are a lot of people that aren't [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4619.04s)]
*  psyched about Trump in certain ways, particularly amongst Democrats, but if you look at the polling [[01:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4622.72s)]
*  our pal Harry Antin was breaking this down the other day, amongst, and this shows you something [[01:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4627.12s)]
*  about the supposed split between the kind of isolationists and the more traditional Republicans [[01:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4631.360000000001s)]
*  or so-called neocons. That's a kind of Twitter debate in a lot of ways because if you look at [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4636.24s)]
*  the polling that Harry showed, it was like 75 percent of Republicans were on board with the [[01:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4640.4800000000005s)]
*  strikes on Iran's nuclear facilities. I don't know if those polls, how accurate they are, if they'll [[01:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4646.64s)]
*  stay, but it suggests that the people that are not interested in neoconservatism, not interested [[01:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4652.24s)]
*  in American adventurers and the broad or installing new governments are okay with what Trump did [[01:17:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4658.24s)]
*  because Trump isn't acting like a neoconservative in that traditional sense that we can overthrow. [[01:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4664.08s)]
*  And he doesn't sound like one, like you'd know if he were, you'd have a different feel. He's just [[01:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4669.12s)]
*  so direct on everything. He doesn't try to hide anything. Like Hannity said to me many years ago, [[01:17:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4674.4s)]
*  the problem with Trump is not that he lies too much. It's that he tells the truth. [[01:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4679.6s)]
*  Like it's all out there, just good, bad, or ugly for the beholder. All right. [[01:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4682.96s)]
*  And he's been retweeting Hannity all day. And Hannity is the one in the kind of Tucker universe [[01:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4686.96s)]
*  who's one of the bad guys at Fox who's pushing for war. And Trump has been retweeting, retruing, [[01:18:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4692.64s)]
*  whatever you say, his stuff in the past 24 hours. So it tells you something. [[01:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4698.96s)]
*  Okay. We have to talk about the mayoral race. And there's another thing we have to talk about [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4703.4400000000005s)]
*  what's happened with the Supreme Court. I really hope I can get this in there is this crazy ass [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4708.0s)]
*  Boston judge tries to defy the US Supreme Court. He's about to get his ass handed to him. [[01:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4711.04s)]
*  So I'll do them in that order because I really want to get to the mural thing and that the [[01:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4716.8s)]
*  other one can hold if we needed to. First of all, is it 110 degrees in New York City today? [[01:18:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4720.64s)]
*  It is 170 degrees. I want them to be happy. And I don't want them to hear the zooming and [[01:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4728.48s)]
*  the buzzing of the of the air conditioner. So I am literally in like a Finnish hot like it's [[01:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4735.84s)]
*  I've never been as hot as I am right now. So if I say that we should bomb, you know, Alaska, [[01:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4742.72s)]
*  because 110 degrees in New York is unbelievable. It's so hot. I mean, here down at the beach, [[01:19:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4748.88s)]
*  it's a lot. It's like 10 degrees cooler. And it's I don't know, low 80s here. But in New York, [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4754.8s)]
*  in New York, what is it today? It says it's going to be 100 degrees. Go ahead, Matt. [[01:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4760.24s)]
*  Yeah. And I'm just Albert Brooks in broadcast news. You know, when you go. [[01:19:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4764.48s)]
*  Yes, flop sweat. The whole continent map is going to start to wave behind us. [[01:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4768.0s)]
*  It's a great day to go out and vote for people who belong to the Democratic parties. [[01:19:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4775.28s)]
*  Thank God, that's not me. But yeah, it's the Democratic primary today. I've seen pictures, [[01:19:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4779.599999999999s)]
*  actual pictures of people lining up enthusiastically ahead of time to vote. [[01:19:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4784.719999999999s)]
*  What people need to understand about New York, too, is those concrete buildings [[01:19:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4790.08s)]
*  hold the heat, right? It's like you and it's like walking next to an oven, you know, gives off heat. [[01:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4794.0s)]
*  And so just be standing there waiting to vote. And for what? For this democratic socialist, [[01:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4799.679999999999s)]
*  which is a nice way of softening socialist who looks like he's going to win. We have to talk [[01:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4805.679999999999s)]
*  about this crazy guy. His name is Zoran Modani. I keep messing up his last name. I don't know. [[01:20:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4814.4s)]
*  Mom, Donnie. Mom, Donnie. And he is a strange man who wants a $30 minimum wage. It's just over half [[01:20:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4822.639999999999s)]
*  that right now. He wants a $30 minimum wage. He wants no more police. He wants social workers [[01:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4832.24s)]
*  instead. He wants free bus rides, which would cost almost a billion dollars for New Yorkers or [[01:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4837.44s)]
*  somebody. I don't know who's going to pay that. He wants to make sure rent stabilized departments [[01:20:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4845.919999999999s)]
*  can't have any increase in their rent. Not sure who's going to pay for that either. He wants a [[01:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4851.759999999999s)]
*  lot of government handouts. He basically when it comes to police and law and justice looks like [[01:20:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4856.639999999999s)]
*  Chesa Boudin, the booted out of office DA in San Francisco. And when it comes to his philosophy [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4862.0s)]
*  on running a city, when it comes to cops and social safety net and also just give giveaways, [[01:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4867.84s)]
*  he looks like just like Brandon Johnson in Chicago. He's terrifying. And the New York [[01:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4873.2s)]
*  community, pathetic as it is, just rolled over and let it have they rolled over. Charles Gasparino [[01:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4878.8s)]
*  has a great piece in the post today, New York Post, about how these feckless MFers who run [[01:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4884.96s)]
*  New York business, you know, what a town they're too afraid. They're like, you know, [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4890.56s)]
*  he's probably going to win. So I have to keep my mouth shut because I need to kiss the ring and [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4895.04s)]
*  have it was done for me. And this guy, according to the latest polls is steamrolling toward the W [[01:21:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4898.72s)]
*  today because if somebody doesn't get over 50% of the vote and it's between him and Cuomo, [[01:21:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4904.240000000001s)]
*  then they go it's ranked choice. So they eliminate the lowest person on the list [[01:21:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4909.92s)]
*  in terms of vote get it vote getters and all those people who vote for that person, [[01:21:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4914.8s)]
*  their second choice gets their votes, which could put and is predicted to put this guy [[01:21:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4919.52s)]
*  over the top is mum Donnie. And mum Donnie is such an odd duck. He wasn't born here. [[01:22:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4925.6s)]
*  I think he was born in Uganda and lived there for the first seven years and then came here. [[01:22:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4932.0s)]
*  But I mean, you come to a country at age seven, and now you're 33. You sound like American, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4936.0s)]
*  you don't sound like a Ugandan at that point. I mean, it's been 25 years plus. But listen to [[01:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4942.72s)]
*  him this hit today, as he was doing an interview with forgive me, I don't know who it was. Look [[01:22:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4949.12s)]
*  like local news to me. And listen to what a faker this dude is with his Kamala Harris in his switch [[01:22:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4955.599999999999s)]
*  a ruse NBC four is Melissa Russo. Listen to this. Because I think that New Yorkers more than they [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4962.8s)]
*  hate a politician they disagree with. They hate a politician they can't trust on the subject of [[01:22:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4968.5599999999995s)]
*  trust. You've adopted different speaking accents in different scenarios, but they go to their local [[01:22:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4972.4s)]
*  bodega. Is there one that's real and one that's affected? What I would say is as any immigrant [[01:22:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4977.44s)]
*  knows, having been born in Kampala, Uganda, and then raised in South Africa and moving here when [[01:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=4983.44s)]

*  shows. I do it on the fifth column. Actually, that's the best detail of that is like in the [[01:23:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5025.84s)]
*  rap video directed by his mother, which is really hot tracks that are dropping. I know man has [[01:23:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5035.52s)]
*  blood. I'll just say quickly that it is interesting today, as you point out, Megan, it's 48,000 degrees [[01:24:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5043.12s)]
*  in New York, and it feels like Cuba and people are going to go vote to make it more like Cuba. [[01:24:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5050.0s)]
*  Every way, and it's like super, it's super depressing. But yeah, there's you missed a [[01:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5055.92s)]
*  few ones like where he was he suggested using empty spaces and disused train stations. And I [[01:24:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5061.360000000001s)]
*  actually think some that are actually a used transition to house the homeless, which if you [[01:24:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5069.6s)]
*  know anything about New York and you ride the subway in New York, as I do know that that's not [[01:24:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5075.4400000000005s)]
*  a problem. That's already happening. And also the same thing is true about the about the free [[01:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5079.84s)]
*  buses, because we have to make the buses are already free. Nobody pays for the bus in New York, [[01:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5085.28s)]
*  and nobody pays for the subway. And one of the great things is like how incompetent and feckless [[01:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5090.16s)]
*  the government in New York is. They've now spent billions of dollars to have this allied [[01:24:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5095.28s)]
*  international whatever the company is that provides guards there who don't do anything. [[01:25:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5100.4s)]
*  They just just a guy getting paid to watch people go through the subway and not pay for it every day. [[01:25:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5106.32s)]
*  So I don't know where they think this stuff is going to come from, where the money is going to [[01:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5110.4s)]
*  come from, who's going to pay for free childcare, rent freezes like this is a collection of voodoo [[01:25:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5114.08s)]
*  economics that every economist on earth knows doesn't work. So so yeah, I mean, I have another [[01:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5122.48s)]
*  I have another objection. I don't think that's a Ugandan accent. Anyway, I that sound like an [[01:25:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5128.88s)]
*  Indian accent to me worldwide tour worldwide tour. That's it's cultural appropriation. [[01:25:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5133.84s)]
*  Well, he's all the other problems. He's also an exploiter because remember that the Indians in [[01:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5139.36s)]
*  Uganda, many Indians came from Uganda, Uganda, because in 1971 or 72, Idi Amin, the dictator, [[01:25:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5144.64s)]
*  when he took over Uganda kicked all the Indians out. And the reason being is they were about 1% [[01:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5150.24s)]
*  of the population, they controlled like 60% of the wealth, because there was a huge population [[01:25:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5154.32s)]
*  of Indian doctors, etc. So that's why he he is Indian. And he was actually born in Uganda, [[01:25:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5158.32s)]
*  because in the sort of DSA, democratic socialist view of the world, he was a horrible exploiter. [[01:26:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5163.12s)]
*  So yeah, that's that's [[01:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5168.96s)]
*  Do we have to give him a pass? Maybe we have to give him a pass on that. But in I don't give him [[01:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5170.24s)]
*  a pass on that because he's an American who sounds like an American in every other interview he [[01:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5173.5199999999995s)]
*  gives right? It's only when he needs it. Like Kamala Harris, have you no empathy man that [[01:26:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5178.32s)]
*  Camille, you know, I mean, well, it happens. But it doesn't usually happen in [[01:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5186.08s)]
*  context where I'm doing media. If I'm around family, and everyone has the heavy patois, [[01:26:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5192.64s)]
*  I might slip into it a little bit. But for the most part, because they will ridicule me because [[01:26:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5197.84s)]
*  I don't do it well. I try my best to police it. I'm usually aware of it when it's happening. [[01:26:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5201.6s)]
*  I don't make a conscious choice, but I at least know that I'm doing it. And I don't know, I think [[01:26:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5208.8s)]
*  for both him and Kamala, you can kind of see the switch almost take place, you know, the context [[01:26:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5214.72s)]
*  in which they're about to go into this particular style of oration for persuasive purposes. [[01:27:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5220.24s)]
*  Camille, can I interrupt you? I frown on that. I can't deal with this lying on one of the greatest [[01:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5226.4s)]
*  podcasts in America. It might be true that when you are amongst your Jamaican family, you're like, [[01:27:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5231.28s)]
*  Oh, you're lazy, blood clotting, you do stuff like that. Fine. But I have seen you on the subway. [[01:27:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5237.76s)]
*  Yeah, in a different situation, code switch into a different accent. Is that not true? [[01:27:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5243.76s)]
*  Camille Foster. Let's hear it. [[01:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5249.92s)]
*  Where? I know that you don't. Yeah. So if someone steps on your brand new Yeezy. [[01:27:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5251.2s)]
*  Well, yeah. Well, no. What are you going to say, Camille? [[01:27:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5256.0s)]
*  It's well, yeah, you want me to slip into my urban vernacular. Yeah. Right. [[01:27:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5258.16s)]
*  And I do, I do has to do that sometimes. But that is under particular circumstances. And it is not [[01:27:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5263.679999999999s)]
*  usually to confront someone who stepped on my shoes. Yeah, sometimes it's to evade detection [[01:27:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5270.8s)]
*  in circumstances. I would rather you not know that I'm very clean and articulate. [[01:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5277.44s)]
*  Yes. Yes. For people to call you like you are. You look like my uncle, Thomas. Like, for instance, [[01:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5282.16s)]
*  when I've heard people say that I've heard that before. I've never met the man, but I've never [[01:28:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5289.2s)]
*  met the man. Yeah. But then you're like, yeah, you remind me. Yeah. [[01:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5293.5199999999995s)]
*  If we're cross examining Camille, can we get a vote Camille on Mom Donnie's rapism? How was this? [[01:28:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5298.32s)]
*  How was this rhyming? Well, well, Matt, I was watching your face. Had you not seen the clips [[01:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5304.719999999999s)]
*  of him rapping? Oh, no, it's it's so bad. It's so bad. But also, I will say this Afrobeats is kind [[01:28:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5308.719999999999s)]
*  of a big thing. And it is it is interesting. And there are great Afrobeats artists, but he is not [[01:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5314.48s)]
*  one of them. So it's good that he gave that career up. It's unfortunate that he decided to run for [[01:28:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5320.4s)]
*  mayor. So yeah, exactly. Wait, Steve Cracker wants us to he wants us to take a look at another clip. [[01:28:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5325.84s)]
*  I don't know what it is. Just roll it. Let's see. Oh, no. [[01:28:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5330.88s)]
*  Our future will not be different until we make a different choice. We have to fill out the entire [[01:28:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5333.92s)]
*  ballot and do not rank Andrew Cuomo. New York City. We need a new day. We deserve a chance. [[01:29:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5340.88s)]
*  A New York City that centers working people. All of these concepts are just ideas in the clouds. [[01:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5348.72s)]
*  If we do not bring them home, elect Zohran for mayor. God, leave the clouds. [[01:29:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5357.84s)]
*  Did you hear her doing the Obama thing? Like she does. She's another code switcher. Yeah. Yeah, [[01:29:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5365.2s)]
*  I was I was waiting to see which one of those affects she was going to bring. I expected the [[01:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5370.08s)]
*  wise Latina, but we didn't get that in that particular ad. But you know what? I hate this [[01:29:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5374.64s)]
*  idea of working people like the only people who work just do like jobs that don't pay very well. [[01:29:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5378.400000000001s)]
*  And it's like manual labor. The rest of us don't work. We're not working people. But one of the [[01:29:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5384.48s)]
*  things that the reason I don't know about the rap ism in his code switching is that I've been [[01:29:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5388.24s)]
*  paying attention to his outrageously shitty ideas. And one of them, that's what makes you racist. [[01:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5394.32s)]
*  Yeah, I don't. Well, clearly, because I don't want to give my money to the MTA to set on fire, [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5401.04s)]
*  which they already do. But you see guys like John Katz and the TDS, who's like a perennial [[01:30:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5406.799999999999s)]
*  candidate in New York. He has a show on the idea owns W.A.B.C. W.A.B.C. And he owns. Yeah, [[01:30:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5412.64s)]
*  he owns Gristini's supermarket. He had a comment the other day, which is true. He's been talking [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5418.0s)]
*  to his fellow rich people who definitely don't work because they're not working people in about [[01:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5422.0s)]
*  particularly in like the financial services industry. This stuff is portable, man. They [[01:30:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5426.400000000001s)]
*  don't have they don't have shops. They don't have like, you know, we have a store on the corner. Can [[01:30:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5431.280000000001s)]
*  we move like they can move to Miami as so many people during during very easily. So I know you [[01:30:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5435.52s)]
*  hate those guys, but it's your tax base in the number of people who say, well, they got to pay [[01:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5441.92s)]
*  their fair share. Look who pays the taxes in New York City. And on top of it, people should know [[01:30:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5445.6s)]
*  this who don't don't live in this. As you point out, Megan, the best city on earth, but also the [[01:30:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5449.6s)]
*  worst at times, too, is that we don't pay federal tax only. We don't pay state tax only. There's a [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5454.24s)]
*  city tax in New York, which is also punishing. And you increase that on people. The number of [[01:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5459.52s)]
*  people we're working paid over 50 percent taxes easily. Yeah, of course. A city. Then they lob [[01:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5465.76s)]
*  on extra taxes like just if you're rich enough, just like extra random fees that you have to pay. [[01:31:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5471.68s)]
*  That's an additional like your rent tax and all that. Like they there is so much taxation [[01:31:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5476.8s)]
*  already in New York. So and people are fleeing. They've already been fleeing. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5481.360000000001s)]
*  I know there's only so many people Ron DeSantis can house. I just I'm not sure what the plan is [[01:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5486.0s)]
*  here because I love music. We'll watch. Yes, we will. We'll see. How about the center? You know [[01:31:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5490.56s)]
*  how we hate platform isn't centering also. Oh, my God. Worst verb. Oh, it's not a verb. [[01:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5497.28s)]
*  They make fun of rich people for saying they summer places. Right. Yes. Centering is worse [[01:31:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5505.44s)]
*  than summering. OK, years ago, we knew this family and the woman was like, we we saw these boats lined [[01:31:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5511.28s)]
*  up and we're like, oh, wow, that's that's really cool. It's like this big motorboat. And she goes, [[01:31:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5517.759999999999s)]
*  I prefer a sailing vessel. And that's the same kind of person who's using the term center. [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5522.320000000001s)]
*  I'm glad you mentioned Brandon Johnson in Chicago, Megan, because it's a it's a good example. I think [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5530.080000000001s)]
*  that this is mom, Donnie is trying to Chicago, New York, where really, really awful democratic [[01:32:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5535.84s)]
*  and democratic socialist governance treats an existing great city. Chicago is a wonderful city [[01:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5543.120000000001s)]
*  that still throws off a lot of wealth. They just treat it as something to act as a predator on [[01:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5550.4800000000005s)]
*  like, OK, cool, we've got a guaranteed revenue stream. I'm going to get more of it, use it to [[01:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5556.08s)]
*  accumulate power and use it to enrich my buddies in usually in some kind of public sector union [[01:32:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5561.6s)]
*  context. And in the process, you're going to have levels of debt and obligations to pensions. [[01:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5567.4400000000005s)]
*  People are going to run fleeing because the combined taxation of the place is just insane. [[01:32:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5574.24s)]
*  That's what's happening here. It's what what's happening to way, way, way too many large cities [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5579.04s)]
*  in this country. I know there's a couple of guys out with a book called The Abundance Agenda, [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5583.84s)]
*  you know, trying to to convince Democrats to be more, I don't know, useful on like, [[01:33:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5588.08s)]
*  have public policy heathered to results. And they're getting tons of pushback, by the way, [[01:33:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5594.24s)]
*  from the left, like, how dare you? How dare you say the government work? It's a really bad sign [[01:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5599.28s)]
*  that there is a large number of people in New York who look at a guy who's never worked a day [[01:33:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5605.6s)]
*  in his life, as far as I can tell, in the sector. Yeah, so I think his mom's mother [[01:33:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5609.6s)]
*  wrap wrapping his hard work there. Come on, Matt. His mom is my kids do that in front of me all the [[01:33:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5614.320000000001s)]

*  Tucker said and he said this many times like, I want my country to be nice. And he was talking [[01:33:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5625.92s)]

*  you're like, ew, this is disgusting. How is there this much trash on the way to the airport? Where [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5639.12s)]
*  are the where are the sanitation workers? You know, it's, it's like a slow crumble that we're [[01:34:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5645.28s)]
*  seeing in blue controlled cities in often blue controlled states, but it can happen in red [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5651.2s)]
*  controlled states, too. Usually it happens in the blue controlled cities of those states. And [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5656.48s)]
*  this is why Tucker wants us to take the money we gave to Ukraine and spend it on, you know, America. [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5662.639999999999s)]
*  I just don't believe that if the federal Congress kept the money that we gave to Ukraine, I don't [[01:34:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5667.2s)]
*  believe they'd well spend it. I don't believe they'd clean anything up. I feel like it'd be [[01:34:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5671.36s)]
*  somehow would wind up in Nancy Pelosi's next mansion. However, I do think local leaders are [[01:34:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5675.2s)]
*  to blame. And that's why it's so upsetting to see this happen in New York City. Like we just keep [[01:34:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5681.36s)]
*  electing far left Democrats who are ruining the country. They're ruining the country with [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5685.76s)]
*  their terrible open border policies and leftist economic policies. Mayor Bill de Blasio ruined [[01:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5692.400000000001s)]
*  New York. He ruined it. We were thriving under Giuliani and then Bloomberg, who was a Republican [[01:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5700.96s)]
*  slash independent. And then, you know, he called himself an independent and eventually not. But [[01:35:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5708.56s)]
*  my point is they were right leaning. And that's really the solution to Tucker's problem and to [[01:35:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5712.64s)]
*  our problem. We need responsible fiscal leadership in there. We need people who understand what that [[01:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5717.84s)]
*  kind of taxation will do to the actual money earners. They will flee. It's a free country. [[01:35:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5724.240000000001s)]
*  You can go to other states. And this guy, Mamdani, is exactly the opposite of what we need, [[01:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5728.64s)]
*  who has a very good shot of taking over as the mayor of our biggest and one of our best cities. [[01:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5734.88s)]
*  Go ahead. That's why the Bannons of the world drive me crazy when you can. I like debates [[01:35:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5739.04s)]
*  within the Republican Party, as we're talking about, particularly when it comes to foreign [[01:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5745.84s)]
*  polls. But people like Steve Bannon, who are Democratic socialists in their own way, they hate [[01:35:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5748.48s)]
*  the financial industry. That's fine. Trump has been skeptical of them, too. But the idea that [[01:35:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5755.84s)]
*  New York City needs more money is insane. It's completely ridiculous. All you have to look at [[01:36:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5761.2s)]
*  is focus in on the MTA, which is the transit authority that runs the buses and the subways [[01:36:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5766.96s)]
*  and the trains, and then go to a place that has insanely high taxation, like Sweden, and ride those [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5773.04s)]
*  subways and trains and be like, wow, this is amazing. You do not get that feeling flying into [[01:36:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5779.52s)]
*  Arlinda Airport in Stockholm that you got Megan flying into JFK. It's like we have these strangle [[01:36:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5783.6s)]
*  holds of the MTA union. And you look at these people, there was a story The New York Times did [[01:36:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5790.56s)]
*  five or six years ago, maybe even longer, that was really good reporting about the insanely inflated [[01:36:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5796.08s)]
*  salaries of everybody who works for the MTA. I mean, they're like a couple hundred thousand [[01:36:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5801.360000000001s)]
*  dollar salaries for just these not very impressive jobs. Look at the Second Avenue subway. How long [[01:36:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5805.4400000000005s)]
*  has it taken to try to build the Second Avenue subway? What are we on, 50 years now? I'm not even [[01:36:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5810.72s)]
*  joking. It's insane. It's not as if the money is not there. There is bureaucracy. There is union [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5814.88s)]
*  truculent union members and union bosses. It's impossible to get anything done in the city. Buy [[01:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5821.84s)]
*  an apartment. I've never bought an apartment in the city. Camille has in trying to get anything [[01:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5826.88s)]
*  done because there's layers and layers and layers of red tape. God forbid. God forbid you need to [[01:37:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5830.88s)]
*  run out government. This government's the problem here. It's not money. My recommendation to anyone, [[01:37:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5836.16s)]
*  if you want to an easy comp is first look at a chart of the average level of taxation or [[01:37:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5840.88s)]
*  government expenditure in Florida and in New York State. Don't even like use New York City, [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5846.96s)]
*  although they have the extra income tax. Florida and New York State, it's completely lopsided. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5851.52s)]
*  Next, get into your car in both places and drive for two hours. Starting in New York City and you [[01:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5856.4800000000005s)]
*  can take it upstate. Starting in Miami, take it anywhere. The roads in Florida are great. [[01:37:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5862.96s)]
*  Highways are fantastic. You can take high speed train in Florida, believe it or not. And in New [[01:37:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5868.56s)]
*  York, soon, especially when you cross into the border of New York City, your tires are going to [[01:37:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5874.0s)]
*  be shredded after driving for like 30 minutes. They haven't fixed any road as far as I can tell. [[01:37:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5879.68s)]
*  They've just done construction forever, but they haven't fixed anything. [[01:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5885.04s)]
*  It's so annoying too. It wasn't always like this. When I lived in Chicago in the mid 1990s, [[01:38:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5889.6s)]
*  they were under Democrat rule. It was Bill Daley and he was a very famous, well-known [[01:38:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5895.04s)]
*  mayor. Daley was responsible for Chicago and you could eat off the sidewalks. It was so clean, [[01:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5900.16s)]
*  but the Democrat party has lost its mind and doesn't understand what to prioritize anymore. [[01:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5906.88s)]
*  They're much more worried about pronouns and putting the homeless people, taking them out of [[01:38:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5911.84s)]
*  the subway car and putting them on the subway platform as a real solution than they are about [[01:38:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5915.52s)]
*  solving real people's problems. So that's what needs to happen. Better leadership in the cities [[01:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5922.400000000001s)]
*  and the states. Stand by. I'm going to take a break. And then I have one subject I need to discuss [[01:38:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5928.400000000001s)]
*  with you guys. And it's not the Supreme court thing. I'll get to that tomorrow. It's a tweet [[01:38:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5933.2s)]
*  I sent out this morning. Stand by. Have you heard of caroluma? It's an edible cactus that grows in [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5936.72s)]
*  India and it can be a natural appetite suppressant. Caroluma is just one of the natural ingredients [[01:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5943.599999999999s)]
*  doctors added to a weight loss supplement called lean. If you have a bold summer weight loss goal, [[01:39:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5948.48s)]
*  but injections are not for you, here's what the doctors who formulated lean have to say. They [[01:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5953.44s)]
*  say the supplement is close to the benefits of those popular injections. Like injections, lean was [[01:39:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5958.72s)]
*  created to help maintain healthy blood sugar and help control appetite and cravings. But those who [[01:39:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5964.0s)]
*  created lean say the rare ingredients in lean are also designed to help burn fat by converting [[01:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5969.76s)]
*  fat into energy. And of course, no needles. They say it's a healthier way to lose weight by capturing [[01:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5974.96s)]
*  the power of natural ingredients. Give it a try with 20% off by using the code MK 20 at take lean [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5979.92s)]
*  calm. That's code MK 20 at take lean calm. These statements have not been evaluated by the FDA. [[01:39:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=5986.64s)]

*  how it works. Criminals can forge your signature on one document, use a fake notary stamp, pay a [[01:40:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6009.52s)]
*  small fee with your country, county that is, and just like that, your home title has been transferred [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6014.8s)]

*  I can't do accents. The only accent I can do well is just drunk accent. [[01:41:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6066.08s)]
*  It's because I spent so many years covering Kamala Harris, so I nailed it. [[01:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6074.24s)]
*  I don't know if we're in the air because if we were, I would do a lot of accents, but I can't. [[01:41:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6081.12s)]

*  Jesse Jackson is a fan. Jesse Jackson is a fan favorite. My daughter always asked me to do [[01:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6102.5599999999995s)]

*  one of the funniest when I knew that my daughter was the best, she looked at me and she said, [[01:41:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6118.88s)]
*  Papa, why? That's how they talk. And I said, well, yes, that is true, but you just can't. [[01:42:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6122.400000000001s)]

*  Nothing. Nothing. The best one has been Baron, the video of him as a child. Yes. [[01:42:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6159.360000000001s)]
*  Where he sounds Slovenian. Because his father clearly has never talked to him. [[01:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6166.08s)]

*  Melania obviously was very, very attached to Baron and was a great and is a great mom. [[01:43:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6183.52s)]
*  We, we love her all the time with our kids. This is from some interview they gave [[01:43:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6188.88s)]
*  and how they talked to Baron. We quote them all the time at the dinner table. It happens almost [[01:43:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6193.280000000001s)]
*  once a night. Small bites Baron, small bites Baron. This is Trump and Melania. I guess I kept [[01:43:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6197.92s)]
*  saying that to him. Like most teenage boys or young boys. He's like trying to shovel the whole [[01:43:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6206.16s)]
*  thing in his face. Small bites Baron. I say it's all three of my kids because they're also big [[01:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6211.04s)]
*  biters of food. Okay. I needed to discuss this very important tweet I sent out. That has gotten [[01:43:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6215.52s)]
*  some hilarious responses. So I'm at the beach for the summer and we're in a rental. It's a [[01:43:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6221.4400000000005s)]
*  long story, but our house had to have some renovations and this is now the second summer [[01:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6227.84s)]
*  that we had to be in a rent, a rental because this Renault is taking forever. So we're in a rental [[01:43:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6233.360000000001s)]
*  and the rental doesn't come with any linens. So we, you get here, there's nothing, there's, [[01:43:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6239.84s)]
*  there's no sheets. We're here for two months. There's no sheets. There's no beds. There's beds, [[01:44:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6245.6s)]
*  but there's no comforters and there's no towels, which I'm sure somebody told me in advance and [[01:44:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6251.360000000001s)]
*  then I just forgot. It's like mum Donnie's house. So I'm running around getting linens, getting like, [[01:44:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6256.16s)]
*  you know, all the stuff that you need and I go to Target. Thankfully there's a Target. So I go to [[01:44:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6263.76s)]
*  the Target and I decided to get a little rug for the bathroom because the bathroom floor is too [[01:44:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6268.08s)]
*  cold and I like the bathroom floor to have a little heat on it. And so I bought a little area [[01:44:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6275.92s)]
*  rug. I went a little crazy at Target. I'm not going to lie. It's not the prettiest rug I've ever [[01:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6282.8s)]
*  seen. I'm going to show you a picture of it, but it's fine. It's a rental and it was cheap. It was [[01:44:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6287.12s)]
*  like $25. It was relatively inexpensive for a big rug. Okay. There it is. Can you see it? It's fine. [[01:44:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6291.2s)]
*  Terrible. Right. It's not terrible. Sure. It's fine for a few months. Then I'm sure we can find a [[01:44:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6298.16s)]
*  place for it after that, but I get it home and I'm pulling all the tags off of it and I take a look [[01:45:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6303.04s)]
*  at the one tag and it caused me some alarm, fellas, because it reads as follows. Fiber, [[01:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6309.44s)]
*  colon, made of miscellaneous scraps of undetermined fiber content. [[01:45:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6317.12s)]
*  What's that? Miscellaneous scraps of undetermined fiber content. What are you hiding? [[01:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6325.36s)]
*  What's in there? Made? Where is it made? In India. Oh. It says made in India. Have you seen Slumdog Millionaire? [[01:45:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6336.4s)]
*  I have. I'm concerned. It says vacuum regularly. Do not use beater brush. Blot spills promptly. [[01:45:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6344.639999999999s)]
*  Spot clean with mild cleaning solution. Do not bleach. Professional rug cleaning. Now, [[01:45:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6354.96s)]
*  what does that mean? Do have a professional rug cleaning or vacuum regular? I don't understand. [[01:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6361.44s)]
*  What is in the scraps that makes it? Don't use beater brush. [[01:46:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6368.16s)]
*  And I have to tell you. Is it because it will fall apart? Is that if you hit it with a stick? [[01:46:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6374.96s)]
*  But I have to tell you something very bad. Very bad. I was standing on it doing my makeup [[01:46:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6380.719999999999s)]
*  and my feet started to itch. Something's in the rug. Yes. Do you know why they use the word [[01:46:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6387.12s)]
*  undetermined? Because they don't know what it is. So maybe put it out. You're in New Jersey, right? [[01:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6393.28s)]
*  Just put it out on the beach. Just put it out. I'll take it. Yeah. I don't think I can keep the rug. [[01:46:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6400.639999999999s)]
*  No, get $25. I know, but it's like. By the way, when the Renault is done, [[01:46:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6406.32s)]
*  Megan, you can take the nice one and bring it to the new one. You don't have to buy a garbage one. [[01:46:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6414.96s)]
*  That occurred to me too late. I did. I think there's a possibility. Rugs are portable. [[01:47:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6420.8s)]
*  There's a possibility that what's going on is that it's recycled fibers in which they would [[01:47:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6426.0s)]
*  actually combine a bunch of stuff. And yes, you don't see that warning anywhere else where you [[01:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6431.04s)]
*  get recycled stuff. Well, maybe it's the tariffs they have to label this stuff as what it is. [[01:47:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6436.08s)]
*  Because it's like clearly like they're like Indiana. Fingers and toes are in my [[01:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6442.64s)]
*  life. Well, that's something dark. I know that the rug's got to go. Not only am I having an [[01:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6447.52s)]
*  allergic reaction, I'm allergic to penicillin. Do you think there's penicillin in there? Why are [[01:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6453.84s)]
*  my feet itching when I'm standing on it with naked feet? I have very wrong craziest things, [[01:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6457.12s)]
*  Megan, is that you're still questioning whether you should get rid of the rug. [[01:47:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6461.92s)]
*  Yeah, it's like a hassle to get there. It's on cost fallacy. Don't breathe close to a rug. [[01:47:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6465.68s)]
*  You don't want that. Maybe I'll send it to you guys. We could have a rotation. It could be like [[01:47:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6474.08s)]
*  on a visiting, you know how a museum sends out a museum piece? We could set everybody could have [[01:48:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6480.0s)]
*  a week with it. And then the next time you're on, we could debrief. You think it's going to last [[01:48:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6483.68s)]
*  more than two weeks? I know. We would frame it. We would mount it, frame it, and we would put [[01:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6487.4400000000005s)]
*  up in the new studio. Why don't you have an auction for this? Let's do an auction for this [[01:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6493.12s)]
*  rug and whoever gave the money to charity. That's a great idea. Megan, do not mount it. Don't mount [[01:48:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6497.2s)]
*  it. Don't send through the mail. I don't feel like I'd get through TSA. I'm not sure, but there's [[01:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6505.92s)]
*  something deeply wrong with my rug. I just thought you guys would help me diagnose this. And I think [[01:48:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6516.24s)]
*  we've come to a conclusion. It needs to go. It needs to go. Guys, thank you. It was a pleasure, [[01:48:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6520.16s)]
*  as it always is. We'll see you after we know which terrible person running New York. [[01:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6525.76s)]
*  Stay cool. Bye. And thanks to all of you for listening today. The guys from the Fifth Column [[01:48:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6532.88s)]
*  never disappoint. Tomorrow tune in. We've got Charlie Kirk. That'll be fun too, right? He's [[01:48:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6539.599999999999s)]
*  one of the MAGA faithful. What does he think of the whole Civil War inside of the Republican Party? [[01:49:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6543.84s)]
*  Lots to discuss. We'll talk to you then. [[01:49:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vU4gHmYRHVs&t=6550.16s)]
