# New Details on Bill Belichick’s Relationship, Meghan Markle’s Podcast Interview, with Dave Portnoy
**The Megyn Kelly Show:** [May 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY)
*  Hey everyone, I'm Megyn Kelly. Welcome to the Megyn Kelly show. Just back now from Washington, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=0.0s)]
*  D.C., literally just an hour ago, got back, where I interviewed Director of National Intelligence [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4.64s)]
*  Tulsi Gabbard late yesterday. You can find that interview on youtube.com slash Megyn Kelly and [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=9.68s)]
*  our podcast feeds right now. They posted this morning and there's a lot to unpack from that [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=15.120000000000001s)]
*  interview. She made a ton of news. Plus there are reports today broken initially by our pal [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=20.080000000000002s)]
*  and now part of the MK podcast media network Mark Halprin that National Security Advisor [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=26.64s)]
*  Mike Walz is out. That he's being forced out of the Trump administration. We will break it down [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=32.160000000000004s)]
*  for you. But today I am here live in New York City at the Sirius XM HQ, the worldwide HQ, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=37.44s)]
*  where we have an incredible show for you with Barstool sports founder Dave Portnoy. Cannot [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=45.040000000000006s)]
*  wait to spend two hours with Dave. We've got to talk about Bill Belichick and his 24 year old [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=50.88s)]
*  hostage taker. I mean girlfriend. But most important of all, and even Dave hasn't seen [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=55.52s)]
*  this yet, we have the latest trailer for our own worldwide premiere tomorrow of our new film [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=60.56s)]
*  Blonde, not to be confused with blue, Origin. Blonde Origin. It debuts tomorrow right here [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  on the Megyn Kelly show. Here's our latest trailer. Listen. When zero gravity resulted in zero clue, [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=75.04s)]
*  have you been? Have you been? [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=86.24s)]
*  Three women were brave enough to answer the call. Tomorrow, special coverage of the launch of [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=91.28s)]
*  Blonde Origin. Tomorrow on the Megyn Kelly show. How far will we go for a troll? [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=99.84s)]
*  No, no, no. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=107.6s)]
*  Don't call it a ride. We're going to get to all this now with Dave Portnoy. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=114.8s)]
*  No hassle. Keep your number, keep your phone if you want, or you can upgrade. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=137.6s)]
*  Their 100% US based team can activate your phone in minutes right over the phone. Patriot Mobile [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=141.84s)]
*  is one of the few carriers with access to all three major US networks. And that means exceptional [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=149.04s)]
*  nationwide coverage. Plus they can even put a second number on a different network on one phone. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=154.32s)]
*  It's like carrying two phones in one. They have unlimited data plans, mobile hotspots, [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=160.24s)]
*  international roaming, internet on the go devices, and more. You can't get all this from those big [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=165.36s)]
*  guys. So consider making the switch today and experience the Patriot Mobile difference. Go to [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=170.48000000000002s)]

*  Let's talk about Mike Walsh because while the average audience member might not think Dave [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=217.6s)]
*  Portnoy is the perfect person to discuss this news with, they are wrong because you actually [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=222.88s)]
*  called for his ouster. I said somebody had to go, yes. Yeah, after the Signalgate controversy broke. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=228.8s)]
*  Well, Signalgate was crazy to me, still crazy to me. Then there was follow-up, there was more to [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=235.04000000000002s)]
*  Signalgate with Hesketh, right? Hesketh, right? With like telling his wife and somebody, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=239.6s)]
*  what is it, someone else. His personal lawyer and reportedly many others on that second chain. Yeah, [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=248.07999999999998s)]
*  so I mean, to me that's nuts. The single stuff is nuts. I don't know if that's why he's getting [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=251.76s)]
*  pushed out. It seems pretty late like in the game and like Signalgate to me sort of passed. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=255.51999999999998s)]
*  But is that the point? That didn't draw as much attention. No, I don't think that's how, [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=261.68s)]
*  well, I never know how Trump thinks. You can see here's the thing, he doesn't like giving the media [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=266.16s)]
*  a scalp, right? Like a credit for anything? Yeah. But it also depends on how you look at his mind [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=270.72s)]
*  frame, which I don't know anybody else will. It also, if he did it almost instantly, it could be [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=275.6s)]
*  viewed as, aha, we have accountability here and there's a mistake made and I rectified it instantly. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=280.8s)]
*  So do you think, I don't know, do you think it is directly? That doesn't sound like Trump. Do you think it's [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=287.92s)]
*  directly then Signalgate? I don't know. I think it's probably, and this is complete speculation, [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=291.2s)]
*  I do not have any inside information on this, but I think it's probably he's to Neil Conny and the [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=297.03999999999996s)]
*  strong strain within MAGA right now is the more, they call them the Restrainers. Yeah. The ones who [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=303.28s)]
*  are not Hawks. They don't want us rushing into war with Iran. We had a long talk with Tucker Carlson [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=308.96s)]
*  about this the other day, not involving Mike Walls, but Mike Walls has got a long history in the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=314.64s)]
*  Congress which made him some people's darling and some people's foil on this front. He was always [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=318.8s)]
*  more Neil Conny and he's got a very important post and there was a report in the New York Times [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=324.24s)]
*  about a month ago saying Tulsi, JD, Pete Hegseth and Suzy Wiles, Chief of Staff for Trump, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=328.48s)]
*  stopped him from getting on board that train as it was pummeling toward war with Iran on behalf of [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=334.72s)]
*  or in connection with Israel. So who was on the other side? Who were the administration officials [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=340.88s)]
*  saying let's do this? What Netanyahu wants, like back them in bombing Iran or give them the bombs [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=346.8s)]
*  or we'll do the bombs. The realistic truth was we were going to have to participate very meaningfully [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=351.68s)]
*  in that bombing campaign. We would have been at war with Iran. So it would have been an enormous [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=357.52000000000004s)]
*  thing to do and I do wonder whether that played some role. Yeah. So like 99% of that to be frank, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=362.40000000000003s)]
*  it went right over my head. Like I may have like been glazed over. The thing I know about. Yeah, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=368.48s)]
*  I didn't even know. I knew who he was but the Signal Gate is the one that caught my attention. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=374.8s)]
*  Again, I think it's a delayed response. So your scenario of what you just laid out [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=380.24s)]
*  could make more sense. I'm probably the wrong guy to be like, yeah, all right, that's it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=385.12s)]
*  It's possible. The Signal Gate to me was just you can't have people [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=388.48s)]
*  using Signal and basically sending war plans to reporters or their wife or any of that. So [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=392.88s)]
*  to me that was a fireable offense. So the Signal Gate, it may have played a role. We don't know. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=397.84000000000003s)]
*  Here's what Mark Halperin said. When did this happen by the way? Just now. It's happening right [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=404.64s)]
*  now. Like as I came in here. Yeah, you didn't miss it. So Mark Halperin is part of our new MK [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=408.8s)]
*  Media Network, which I'd love to ask you about because you run a very successful media network. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=414.0s)]
*  And he had his first show on Tuesday and his second show is today. He also does a show on [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=419.12s)]
*  YouTube called Two Way and he broke this news earlier today. Here's some of it with some more [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=423.76s)]
*  context, I believe, SOT7. Three different people have confirmed that the plan now, by the way, [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=428.8s)]
*  is to remove the National Security Advisor, Mike Walz, who was on Fox News this morning, [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=435.44s)]
*  just not that long ago, and his deputy Alex Wong and much of the member current staff team [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=439.12s)]
*  at the National Security Council because of unhappiness throughout the National Security [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=443.76s)]
*  establishment of how they're doing. This was around before Signal Gate. It was widely reported [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=449.36s)]
*  that Signal Gate ironically may have saved Walz's job, as I understand it from my sources, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=454.16s)]
*  a general belief that it's not being run efficiently in an organized way. It may happen [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=458.48s)]
*  as early as today. It may not happen ever because it's Donald Trump, but the plan is for it to happen [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=463.04s)]
*  soon, maybe this weekend. So very interesting. He's saying they wanted to dump him before Signal Gate, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=468.08000000000004s)]
*  but Trump didn't dump him after that because he didn't want to look like he was being reactive [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=476.56s)]
*  to the nasty media. Well, he'd be reactive. I feel like if he's not, who knows? I mean, [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=480.40000000000003s)]
*  I can see this still not happening. I feel like I see reports of things happening that never does [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=484.08000000000004s)]
*  they'll jump on and be like, shame on you media for reporting this. So who knows? I just looked at [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=488.72s)]
*  X as the number one thing. Yeah, shocking, I guess, but I'll believe it when I see Tim Walz, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=494.0s)]
*  number one thing. Well, we're definitely getting to that. Mike Walz has left the chat. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=499.68s)]
*  Is he your man speaker, Tim Walz? No, he is not. What do you mean? What do you mean my man speaker? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=503.92s)]
*  You know how he came out yesterday and said he was the man that Kamala selected to speak to guys like [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=509.84000000000003s)]
*  you, white men of America. I didn't see that, but no, he failed miserably in that realm. You didn't [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=515.44s)]
*  connect with him in that way? Nobody connected with him. Nobody did. Here's what he said. Let's [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=522.5600000000001s)]
*  watch it. We'll go from Mike Walz to Tim Walz. Here, let's watch. I was on the ticket. I would [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=526.48s)]
*  argue because we did a lot of amazing progressive things in Minnesota to improve people's lives, [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=534.0s)]
*  but I also was on the ticket quite honestly, you know, because I could code talk to white guys [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=538.48s)]
*  watching football, fixing their truck, doing that, that I could put them at ease. I was the [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=544.32s)]
*  permission structure to say, look, you can do this and vote for this. And you look across those [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=548.8000000000001s)]
*  swing states with the exception of Minnesota, we didn't get enough of those votes. But you [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=554.08s)]
*  could give them permission on TV every day. You could have been messaging that way and that isn't [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=559.2800000000001s)]
*  necessarily how it shook out. Well, yes, but I also said I understand myself. I said, I think I'll [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=563.6s)]
*  give you pretty good stuff, but I'll also give you 10% problematic. And so somebody's got to make the [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=568.5600000000001s)]
*  decision here to handle some of this stuff and to make it. And those are just decisions that were [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=574.08s)]
*  made. That's delusional. I mean, that's wildly delusional. I mean, I knew we had the football [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=578.5600000000001s)]
*  thing, but it doesn't speak to a normal guy. He doesn't act like a normal guy. His mannerisms [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=587.12s)]
*  weren't like everyday guy. There was no part of them that connected to what a normal guy is talking [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=591.2s)]
*  about or interested in. And by the way, normal guys can see through that pretty quickly. When [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=598.0s)]
*  you're trying to play the normal guy. I mean, I remember hearing that he was like a football [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=602.1600000000001s)]
*  coach, but even that was a strange coach, the story behind it. So it didn't really work out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=608.08s)]
*  And that anybody, by the way, with a brain could have screened him for five seconds been like, [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=613.12s)]
*  this is the guy that I don't know who they have in the party, by the way, that would have done that. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=618.96s)]
*  But you could have screened him and anybody could have said that right away. But that is one of the [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=622.96s)]
*  problem with the Democrats. They're going to like the Pete Buddha judges of the world to say, [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=628.08s)]
*  is this a man that regular American men can relate to? And he's like, yes, that's our guy. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=632.4000000000001s)]
*  I'm trying to think who on the Democratic side, I would be like, yeah, that's the guy that resonates. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=637.12s)]
*  I mean, you could run it by a man like James Carville. He's got the ability to say, [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=643.6s)]
*  yeah, that's not going to resonate with middle America. Massachusetts Governor Baker. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  He was a pretty normal guy. I don't know why I went to the NCAA, but I would say he was a normal [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=654.5600000000001s)]
*  speak to guy. So you don't think the jazz hands is like jazz hands is not the thing. I mean, [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=659.5200000000001s)]
*  he had a lot of things going. He was one of the worst candidates. The whole ticket was bad. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=664.24s)]
*  That's why they lost. But yeah, that that is, and that's not even a political thing. That's just if [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=668.72s)]
*  you if you asked, if you just pulled a group of guys out of a bar and were like, is this, [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=673.36s)]
*  are you going to be friends with that guy? Most would probably like, no, we're not. So [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=679.44s)]
*  and that is again, it has nothing to do with politics. It's just the vibe he gave off. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=683.28s)]
*  Yeah. Well, on top of all that, what does it say about the Democratic Party that they thought the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=686.8s)]
*  guy who would speak to white guys in America is the guy who mandated tampons in boys rooms [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=691.76s)]
*  throughout Minnesota? They're off. The Democratic Party is is lost. So I don't know. It's interesting [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=699.1999999999999s)]
*  because I never I didn't even know that they were trying to speak to people like, I guess, [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=707.12s)]
*  me or our crowd. If you want to say that's like who Trump spoke with, I didn't even know they were [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=712.88s)]
*  attempting to do that during the election. That didn't seem like something they were interested [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=719.12s)]
*  in. So I didn't know he that was why he was brought on to do that. Well, remember he put on [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=722.72s)]
*  the camo hat and he did some video where he was gaming and apparently he stunk at it. But he went [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=726.48s)]
*  out with a gun and was going to go hunting. And it was very obvious to all Second Amendment people. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=732.16s)]
*  He was not familiar with a gun. He couldn't load it. Yeah, I remember the one when I thought it was [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=736.24s)]
*  Kamala. They asked her what kind of gun she had and she didn't answer correctly. But that's very [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=741.92s)]
*  politics 101. That's I mean, all the way back, the mayor of Boston was called like Sammy Sousa and [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=746.56s)]
*  all the wrong names. Even I know that one. Yeah, they pretend to play a character that they're not, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=752.56s)]
*  which I don't know where who gives them that Intel. I think people would much more respect if you [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=757.12s)]
*  don't pretend to be something you are not. All right. But but that's politics. So let's say they [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=762.0799999999999s)]
*  come to Dave Portnoy next time around and they're like, how do we reach regular guys [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=766.0s)]
*  and convince them to vote them? I mean, you, you can't demonize them, I would say like they're, [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=772.96s)]
*  they've been doing it for a long time. But if you're saying men, and when people are asking me that, [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=782.96s)]
*  I think they generally are talking like white, middle class people working in financial districts, [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=789.44s)]
*  uh, there's a shame that that comes across of saying you're in a frat. And by the way, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=796.4s)]
*  not all frats are good, but wanting to make money, want to have a good job, want to spend money, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=801.92s)]
*  be rich, all that stuff is not necessarily bad. I think that has been a message that comes [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=806.16s)]
*  America's like, yeah, we should be kind of ashamed of being a white guy that doesn't that and I don't [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=811.36s)]
*  think what they fail to understand that doesn't discount that a white guy like me or any can care [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=817.84s)]
*  about a lot of the issues that Democrats care about. But I'm also not really going to apologize [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=822.32s)]
*  for being like a white guy in this country who wants to have a good job, make money, go to college, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=828.5600000000001s)]
*  do all those things. And that is a message that seemingly like you can't be both. Um, they've [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=833.6800000000001s)]
*  never like, I mean, Biden all the way through, it felt like a lot of the issues that get blamed and [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=840.32s)]
*  problems America is always like our fault. Yeah. And we don't want remember even when [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=846.5600000000001s)]
*  the black vote wasn't going as strongly for Kamala as the Dems wanted and Barack Obama showed up at [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=852.0s)]
*  that polling, uh, that campaign office and was like, you're a bunch of sexists. Yeah, right. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=857.36s)]
*  Well, and they've said it, the deplorables and like, you know, there, if you vote for Trump, [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=862.5600000000001s)]
*  there's you're a Nazi and things like that. I don't know if that's exact, but things. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=868.08s)]
*  No, that's literally what's been said on CNN, but people like Don Lemon. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=872.08s)]
*  And then it's like, well, you know, that's you're talking about more than half the countries. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=875.12s)]
*  It's clearly then you should move if you truly believe that. And that's the messaging that we've [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=879.52s)]
*  gotten from them. And somebody like me who is, I'm always in a weird box because I don't consider [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=886.16s)]
*  myself political, but I'm talking about more and more. Like I could easily take out the candidates. [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=892.0799999999999s)]
*  I grew up in a democratic household. My father, I've said a million times hates Trump. Um, I am [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=896.64s)]
*  somebody who you would think would vote Democrat, but as I got older, especially like running [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=902.0799999999999s)]
*  business and doing stuff, they just kept pushing me, pushing me, pushing me to the point this [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=907.44s)]
*  election. It wasn't like I wasn't wavering who I was going to vote for. I was voting for Trump. [[00:15:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=911.84s)]
*  Um, and even I would still revote for Trump. No questions asked. That's how much I hated [[00:15:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=916.96s)]
*  the other ticket. You, um, may not want to see this, but Kamala Harris is also back in the news [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=922.24s)]
*  and you tell me whether we dodged a bullet with this woman where she took to the stage last night [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=927.84s)]
*  at this group that's pushing to get more females involved in Democrat politics running for office. [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=932.72s)]
*  And here's how she sounded. I heard about this. Why did you enjoy it? In fact, please allow me [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=937.52s)]
*  friends to digress for a moment. Okay. It's kind of dark in here, but I'm asking a show of hands. [[00:15:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=943.28s)]
*  Who saw that video from a couple of weeks ago? The one of the elephants at the San Diego zoo [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=949.52s)]
*  during the earthquake. Well, yeah, this is, so that scene has been on my mind. [[00:15:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=954.64s)]
*  Everybody's asking me what you've been thinking about these days. Well, [[00:16:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=966.16s)]
*  yeah, so in the video, here those elephants were, and as soon as they felt the earth shaking beneath [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=972.24s)]
*  their feet, they got in a circle and stood next to each other to protect the most vulnerable. [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=982.0799999999999s)]
*  Oh, think about it. What a powerful metaphor. The lesson is don't, don't scatter. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=991.76s)]
*  The instinct has to be to immediately find and connect with each other [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1004.72s)]
*  and to know that the circle will be strong. Oh my God. Well, yeah, that was a lot more of our [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1013.76s)]
*  campaign speak in which he sent a whole lot of a lot of something, but really not saying anything. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1020.96s)]
*  And also the moral superiority, which even in that comes through as another, like the way they [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1026.72s)]
*  lecture in there. I don't like politicians in general. Like I think probably if you had a hundred [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1032.64s)]
*  politicians room, maybe like two are like truly in it for the right reasons. But the moral superiority [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1038.32s)]
*  when like what they did in the election, which the way they all lied about Biden is mental health [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1044.8s)]
*  for years. And then they waited. So there's no like she would never win. And while she'd never [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1050.24s)]
*  won election, but she would never win a fair primary with the demo. That to me was their biggest [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1056.64s)]
*  mistake because who knows who could have come out of that. But it's lecturing people like they're [[00:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1061.04s)]
*  angels, like they're perfect. They know, they know better than anybody like what's best for you. [[00:17:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1067.04s)]
*  And that we're stupid because we see what the democratic party does. And that's, it's just such [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1072.88s)]
*  a turnoff and say whatever you want about Trump. And people may say other, I, I feel like he's him [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1078.4s)]
*  and like even with these tariffs and stuff like he campaigned on tariff. So then to be like, what do [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1085.76s)]
*  you do with these tariffs? And I'm like that because I'm in the stock markets. I want my stocks to go [[00:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1091.0400000000002s)]
*  up, but it's like, he said he was going to do it at least. So they're just, if you did authentic [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1095.3600000000001s)]
*  and took the Democrats and the Republicans to me, it's not even close. And that's part of how I end [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1102.16s)]
*  up voting Republican. She's so annoying in her mannerisms with her little hands in tight and the, [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1106.48s)]
*  she starts giggling at her own thought. What she's saying is not even purportedly funny. There's [[00:18:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1112.64s)]
*  nothing at all funny. There's no joke coming. She's just giggling at her own little aside. [[00:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1118.0s)]
*  She's not a great public speaker. No, the only time it gets funny is when she lands her point and you [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1122.72s)]
*  realize there's nothing there and she's built it up like this huge profundity only to let us down [[00:18:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1126.96s)]
*  once again. I don't even know what she's doing. What she is she running for what the governor [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1132.4s)]
*  of California? We don't know. She's weighing either that or another presidential run. That's crazy. [[00:18:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1135.92s)]
*  They'd never do that. I don't know. I never say never. I've been a very good person this year. [[00:19:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1140.4s)]
*  It's possible Lord, the Lord will give this to me. Maybe, maybe. Well, there's AOC. Aren't they saying [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1143.92s)]
*  her? Yes. I just think that like the party still loves her. They have no chance to win if she was. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1149.0400000000002s)]
*  I completely agree. No chance. But there are some people out there. Oh gosh, I don't know if I'm [[00:19:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1156.0800000000002s)]
*  going to be able to find it. But there are people out there talking about her right now, [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1159.6s)]
*  like behind the scenes, an off record. They don't want to put their name to it about how, [[00:19:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1162.9599999999998s)]
*  you know, she's really formidable. Like the party really needs to hear. They have a hankering to [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1167.36s)]
*  hear from her. Hold on a second. I have it here. Is that the word they use? Hankering? No, they say, [[00:19:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1172.6399999999999s)]
*  here it is clamoring. There is a clamoring for her voice right now, said a former [[00:19:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1176.3999999999999s)]
*  Harris senior advisor. Meanwhile, I'm like, is he named Pug Clemhoff? Like, don't, this is clearly [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1181.4399999999998s)]
*  like her husband or somebody very close to her. And they say, because they were granted anonymity [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1188.32s)]
*  to speak candidly, meaning really falsely, quote, no one can better prosecute the case while inspiring [[00:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1192.8799999999999s)]
*  a call to action than the former vice president. I mean, we already went down that road. Are they [[00:19:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1199.2s)]
*  just saying she didn't have enough time or something? And you can't get over the fact she knew [[00:20:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1205.52s)]
*  that Biden wasn't fit to be president, just lied about it. I mean, you can't get, I don't know, [[00:20:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1210.72s)]
*  it would be crazy, but they're already nuts to me on who they put forward. So already in crazy town. [[00:20:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1215.6799999999998s)]
*  Yeah. Do it again would be insane. I mean, that's the exact opposite of what we were just discussing. [[00:20:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1221.4399999999998s)]
*  Like how do they get, you know, the typical male vote? I mean, that's the opposite. That's not [[00:20:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1227.1999999999998s)]
*  going to do it. So I mentioned at the top that I sat down with Tulsi Gabbard last night and we had [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1233.1999999999998s)]
*  a bunch of discussions that were really interesting, I thought. And [[00:20:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1239.12s)]
*  it's quite the move going from her to me. [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1242.4s)]
*  And then blonde origin. I mean, it's been that kind of a week, Dave. But here's one thing I [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1246.24s)]
*  want to pick up on that we started the show off with, like this push to get us into another war [[00:20:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1251.28s)]
*  with Iran by these forces behind the scenes. And I'm not blaming that on Mike Wallace. That was just [[00:20:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1254.5600000000002s)]
*  speculation on my point that maybe some perceive him as on that side. But she did speak to, because [[00:20:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1258.88s)]
*  she's anti all that. That's one of the reasons Trump chose her. And I was asking her, like, [[00:21:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1264.16s)]
*  do you feel it? Do you feel like people pushing you towards, you know, all things military, [[00:21:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1269.28s)]
*  all things war? And here's what she said and sat to. [[00:21:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1275.36s)]
*  There was a New York Times article within the past month saying you, he, JD Vance and his chief of [[00:21:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1278.08s)]
*  staff, Suzy Wiles, were all together in urging him to not go too far on our actions against Iran. [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1284.16s)]
*  And President Trump did not do it. He did not give Netanyahu the answer he wanted. [[00:21:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1294.88s)]
*  I know you're not going to get into the specifics of what you advised the president, but can you [[00:21:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1300.3200000000002s)]
*  can you explain your view of the dangers of barreling toward a potential [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1303.68s)]
*  conflict with Iran? [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1311.44s)]
*  Yeah, the the the New York Times article was a result of an unfortunate, unauthorized [[00:21:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1313.92s)]
*  and illegal leak of a very private conversation between the president and his advisors. [[00:22:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1322.56s)]
*  I won't get into the details, but it was a very robust discussion that really speaks to [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1330.88s)]
*  President Trump's care and thoughtfulness as he makes his decisions. [[00:22:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1337.2s)]
*  Do you feel the push, Tulsi, the push of this, like, strong neoconstrain that's still within [[00:22:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1342.56s)]
*  the Republican Party and probably in these agencies that's much more hawkish on an issue, [[00:22:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1348.24s)]
*  including war in the Middle East, which we've just done for 20 years? [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1356.48s)]
*  Yeah, of course. The pressure's there. The leaks have to end. [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1360.56s)]
*  If the president can't have the confidence that he can sit in a room with his closest [[00:22:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1364.56s)]
*  advisors without it leaking to the public, then that is something that really undermines [[00:22:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1369.76s)]
*  his being best served. [[00:22:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1375.04s)]
*  So she's talking about, Dave, how they sat there, she basically confirming, [[00:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1380.32s)]
*  in a private meeting with just the president, with those officials I named with the vice president, [[00:23:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1383.84s)]
*  with the director of national intelligence, with the secretary of defense and his chief of staff. [[00:23:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1388.8799999999999s)]
*  And what she's saying without being explicit about it is then she believes none of them leaked, [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  none of them leaked, but then they have to talk to their staffs about what happened and what needs [[00:23:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1400.8s)]
*  to happen. And at that top, top level, someone's leaking to the New York Times and saying, how are [[00:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1405.44s)]
*  they supposed to function like this? Yeah, you got to start planting fake stories. [[00:23:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1412.56s)]
*  Yeah, right. You got to do that and weed it out. I mean, [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1416.8s)]
*  that would drive me insane. That would drive anybody, regardless of whether it's the president [[00:23:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1419.44s)]
*  of the United States, obviously different table stakes, but any CEO, any leader, you can't have [[00:23:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1423.28s)]
*  that. Yeah, I like that idea. Yeah, you got to do that. They do that in some, like what movie did [[00:23:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1428.0s)]
*  they do that in where they plant like a face, a fake piece of gossip and see who bites? You narrow [[00:23:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1432.32s)]
*  it down. Right? You would narrow it down. Something juicy that they throw at. Just do it with each of [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1436.48s)]
*  those departments if that's where they think it came from. Yeah, I hope they're watching. I'm [[00:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1442.0s)]
*  going to make sure they see this. Got to do it. It's a very good idea. Yeah. Because it's happening [[00:24:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1445.36s)]
*  to Tulsi, it's happening to Trump, it's obviously happening to Hegseth, where like bit by bit, [[00:24:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1448.64s)]
*  they're undermining the whole administration with these leaks. And like, or maybe he's just [[00:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1453.76s)]
*  sending it on a single chat. Right. That also opens it back and be like, well, you guys are idiots [[00:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1458.4s)]
*  and you're, you're texting reporters by accident. She also told me that the Biden administration [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1465.76s)]
*  used signal. And she said, without naming them, she said some of the very exact officials who [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1470.16s)]
*  are dumping on us for being on a signal chat, she was one of the ones used signal and she has proof [[00:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1474.64s)]
*  of it. Well, that's the most unsurprising, like, comment ever. I mean, they could have sent it to [[00:24:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1479.12s)]
*  that same reporter in the Atlantic and he wouldn't have said anything. That's right. But you very much [[00:24:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1485.36s)]
*  don't want to send it to somebody you know openly hates your guts. Yeah. So yeah, then you're going [[00:24:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1490.8s)]
*  to have to live with it. You're telling me it's, they're being hypocrites. That's not surprising [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1494.6399999999999s)]
*  to me at all. Not surprising at all. Here she is a little bit more on these leaks coming out of the [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1498.8s)]
*  administration. Me too. Here's Sot3. You've referred three people now to DOJ for criminal [[00:25:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1503.52s)]
*  prosecution. Do you think they will be prosecuted? That's the goal. That's the goal. And the only way [[00:25:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1508.88s)]
*  we bring about accountability is by doing the work of conducting these investigations. [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1515.1200000000001s)]
*  The Department of Justice and the FBI obviously have different tools that they can use in order to [[00:25:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1522.5600000000002s)]
*  to find the truth and to seek out that evidence so that we can actually prosecute these crimes. [[00:25:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1529.2s)]
*  People know they've been referred? Like are they still working? In some cases, they know. In other [[00:25:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1534.96s)]
*  cases, they are likely not aware. I mean, that's kind of badass frankly because what she's doing is [[00:25:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1540.08s)]
*  she's not telling everybody that she, like I know it was you, Fredo. She's letting Fredo just continue. [[00:25:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1547.6000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, try to scare them. And then the next call they get is going to be from somebody saying the DOJ [[00:25:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1552.56s)]
*  is here or the FBI is here to arrest you. They did it differently over at the Department of Defense [[00:25:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1557.6000000000001s)]
*  where Pete or his team, his investigators, investigated these leaks and then fired three [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1562.48s)]
*  guys who immediately went to the media, including yours truly, to say we're not the leakers. None [[00:26:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1570.24s)]
*  has been arrested. We don't know whether they will be arrested. They all deny they did it. [[00:26:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1575.44s)]
*  I have to say as between the two, this is probably the better course because it's like they're not [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1579.92s)]
*  twisting in the wind as leakers who can speak out about it. They're in cuffs by the time we learn [[00:26:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1585.76s)]
*  their names. Yeah. I mean, it can't be obviously it's a major crime at that level to be leaking [[00:26:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1589.84s)]
*  information. It's also the last thing they should be worrying about. Like they're running the [[00:26:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1594.8s)]
*  government. That's the thing. I mean, to be worrying about internal leaks seems like there [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1599.04s)]
*  should be a better use of time, but you can't ignore it. That's the thing. It's so undermining. [[00:26:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1602.8799999999999s)]
*  All right. One other point on Tulsi. Where were you on like the COVID lockdowns and the overreach [[00:26:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1607.9199999999998s)]
*  by Fauci and all that stuff? So I was very much on the side of you got to let [[00:26:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1613.6s)]
*  small businesses decide whether they want to stay open or not. Like we're all kind of adults here [[00:27:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1621.84s)]
*  and if you want to be open, so I hated the lockdowns. We started a gigantic like a fund [[00:27:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1627.04s)]
*  for companies that were shut down. We raised like $50 million. That's right. Yeah. We covered that. [[00:27:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1633.6799999999998s)]
*  So we were very much trying to help small businesses who were basically going out of [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1638.72s)]
*  business through no fault of their own. What do you think of Fauci? [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1644.48s)]
*  I mean, I see all the stuff that says he's a criminal. He should go to jail. He hit it. [[00:27:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1649.92s)]
*  I haven't delved enough. I mean, my knee jerk reaction on the guy when I see him is I actually [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1654.72s)]
*  find him to be believable when he like he's speaking on camera, but you see all this stuff. [[00:27:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1660.64s)]
*  So I want to convict them without any hard evidence. You may be like, well, I have hard evidence, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1665.6799999999998s)]
*  but I think the whole lockdown thing was handled horribly. Well, I asked her about it. This is one [[00:27:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1669.6799999999998s)]
*  of the first things we covered and I think it was probably the biggest piece of news to come out of [[00:27:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1674.08s)]
*  the interview. Well, let's watch the exchange and then I'll fill in the blanks here. We already know [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1677.4399999999998s)]
*  that EcoHealth Alliance was partnering with this Wuhan lab to create to do gain a function. We just [[00:28:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1682.0s)]
*  have never been able to have somebody say it and it was that exact experiment that led to this COVID [[00:28:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1688.32s)]
*  bug. But have we gotten there? What's the new thing that you're digging in on? We are working [[00:28:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1693.92s)]
*  on that with Jay Bhattacharya. I mean, that would be extraordinary because just so the audience knows, [[00:28:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1700.4s)]
*  if that's true, if it was Peter Dazic's research with the Wuhan so-called Bat Lady that caused this [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1704.8000000000002s)]
*  pandemic, then we did fund it. Then Anthony Fauci helped fund the pandemic. The things that he denied [[00:28:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1710.16s)]
*  over and over and over to Senator Rand Paul's questioning. That's right. Under oath. It's an [[00:28:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1716.4s)]
*  under oath. Exactly. So is it any wonder that he sought a preemptive pardon for anything [[00:28:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1722.64s)]
*  during a certain period of time by President Biden before he left office? That's the director [[00:28:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1729.68s)]
*  of national intelligence clearly intimating that they're about to tie Anthony Fauci and this group, [[00:28:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1735.2s)]
*  EcoHealth Alliance that he funded to the actual COVID virus. Yeah, which is insane. So then what [[00:29:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1741.92s)]
*  is this giant cover up that or I like? Yes. Yeah. So that's crazy. That's huge. That's a link we've [[00:29:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1748.0s)]
*  never been able to close. We've been able to close. We funded EcoHealth Alliance. They partner with [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1755.3600000000001s)]
*  the Wuhan lab. They did gain of function research on bat coronaviruses, but we've never been able [[00:29:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1759.3600000000001s)]
*  to make the leap to, and it resulted in this coronavirus. And that's what she says she's [[00:29:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1764.64s)]
*  intimating is about to come. Yeah, it's crazy. If that's true, he lied under oath repeatedly. [[00:29:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1770.5600000000002s)]
*  Yeah. And he needed that pardon. I mean, everybody got pardoned pretty much by Biden, [[00:29:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1776.96s)]
*  right? Like for the most part. But I mean, the fact that the guy running this huge piece of NIH [[00:29:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1782.48s)]
*  was perjuring himself, allegedly, we'll find out, to the point where it wasn't just a courtesy [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1790.32s)]
*  pardon to prevent harassment. Like he actually may have committed felonies here. It is huge. [[00:29:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1796.88s)]
*  Like my, yeah, it's crazy. Again, I was very anti-lockdown. I didn't like Fauci. I criticized [[00:30:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1803.84s)]
*  Fauci. Maybe my gut reaction whenever I see the guy, he doesn't scream arch-criminal to me, but [[00:30:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1809.84s)]
*  maybe I'll be wrong. Like, does he give you those vibes? 100%. He does. Yes. So he's a super villain [[00:30:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1820.4799999999998s)]
*  to you. Yes. Like he's the super villain that you don't know is a super villain until the end of the [[00:30:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1825.6s)]
*  movie. Yeah. Well, I mean, in the middle of the movie, it became obvious, but yes, I hate him with [[00:30:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1829.84s)]
*  the passion of 10,000 sons. I think he's completely dishonest. You're not saying he [[00:30:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1834.72s)]
*  intentionally launched COVID. No, I don't think he wanted to. No one's suggesting that. The Intel [[00:30:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1841.76s)]
*  community, no one's saying that. And then it happens and then he's like, oh crap, I got to do this [[00:30:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1847.36s)]
*  giant. And he happens to be the guy who's publicly speaking about it. So it's basically two different [[00:30:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1851.9199999999998s)]
*  things. He launched it, created it. I shouldn't say launch, created it inadvertently, but he's [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1859.2s)]
*  also the guy who's going to be in charge of controlling it. And then you got this, he's [[00:31:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1864.16s)]
*  basically running interference to keep himself from being the guy the entire time. Bingo. Yeah, [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1869.6000000000001s)]
*  it's literally the sci-fi movie. And at the same time, we know from his internal emails that the [[00:31:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1874.4s)]
*  House Republicans got at the time, well, a couple of years after the COVID mania, that he was actively [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1880.0s)]
*  working to smear doctors who were coming out saying, this thing looks like it came from a lab. [[00:31:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1886.16s)]
*  We've never seen this particular virus before in nature. This looks lab made. And he was all over [[00:31:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1892.0s)]
*  the place like tamp that down, get that out there. That's fringe. He made sure that narrative couldn't [[00:31:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1897.68s)]
*  live. It's an insane fool and maybe I'm just naive in thinking like- You still trust the officials? [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1902.8000000000002s)]
*  I don't trust a lot of officials. He just comes across as like a grandpa to me. [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1912.24s)]
*  You've got to spend some time with my husband, Doug, because I am terrible at judging character. [[00:31:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1916.8799999999999s)]
*  I'm always like, he's fine. See, I feel like I'm pretty good. And my husband's really good. [[00:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1922.48s)]
*  And he's always onto people before I am. But even I saw it with Fauci. Was he onto- [[00:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1926.08s)]
*  Yeah, yes. He knew he was bad. I don't know. I think some people just have a knack for this. [[00:32:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1931.6s)]
*  I'm usually like, they're good. What do you mean? I mean, Trump didn't know. [[00:32:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1936.24s)]
*  Yeah, no, he was under Trump. Yeah, for the beginning, for the actual peak of- [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1940.32s)]
*  Getting along like he's doing a great job. [[00:32:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1943.52s)]
*  Yep. I know that was one of Trump's failures. I mean, a lot of Republicans blame him for a [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1946.08s)]
*  vaccine that wound up hurting a lot of people too. Trump stands by the vaccine, but it's got some [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1950.16s)]
*  problems. There's no question. Yeah. I didn't know that people blamed him for that. I mean, [[00:32:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1955.04s)]
*  the vaccine was a way to theoretically open up the country. They wouldn't open it up without that. [[00:32:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1959.12s)]
*  Well, that's what people who don't live in places like New York don't get is like, [[00:32:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1964.96s)]
*  I lived in New York and this is going down. And it's like, you couldn't go anywhere. [[00:32:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1968.08s)]
*  No, nowhere. That's when I moved to Miami. During the COVID, I was in New York, [[00:32:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1971.6799999999998s)]
*  moved to Miami. I basically stayed there. You were like a hostage in your own apartment [[00:32:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1975.6799999999998s)]
*  if you didn't get the damn vaccine. I regret it though. I wish I had gotten one of the fake [[00:33:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1980.0s)]
*  cards. That was such the obvious solution. I'm like a goody two shoes. I don't know why I didn't do it. [[00:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1983.36s)]
*  I was fake card city. Shit. [[00:33:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1987.52s)]
*  You just did it yourself or like- Well, luckily I work in a media company. I still [[00:33:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1991.04s)]
*  don't know. That's how afraid I am. I'm like, I never had it. But yeah, I just said we have [[00:33:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1995.12s)]
*  graphics teams. So we just got a copy of the actual card and made fakes. [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=1999.4399999999998s)]
*  You know, my doctor said to me at the time, I'm like, what do you want? [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2003.28s)]
*  Should I be worried about these mRNA vaccines? And he goes, would you take the mRNA vaccine if [[00:33:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2006.08s)]
*  it could prevent pancreatic cancer? Because that's a future, which was a don't be worried. [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2010.8799999999999s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2015.76s)]
*  And so I was like, okay, I trust my doctor. So I did it and I regret doing it. [[00:33:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2016.1599999999999s)]
*  I wasn't so much worried. It's just like, I don't want to do it. I'll get the card. I was worried. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2019.76s)]
*  There was rumors at one point that they were going to start scanning the barcodes, in which case- [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2024.32s)]
*  You would have been caught. [[00:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2029.6s)]
*  The fake would have no longer worked. But yeah, I was traveling and working in a lot of places. [[00:33:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2030.24s)]
*  But no one looked at it closely. It's like, boop, boop, boop, boop. [[00:33:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2034.72s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:33:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2037.84s)]
*  It's all very easy. [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2038.08s)]
*  Okay. On the subject of the Kamala Harris soundbite where she said, you would've got to be [[00:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2039.84s)]
*  like the elephants to protect the most vulnerable. [[00:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2044.1599999999999s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2047.9199999999998s)]
*  The most vulnerable. The larger context of her remarks are about illegal immigration [[00:34:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2048.24s)]
*  and what's being done right now to deport these alleged gang members. What's so insane is they [[00:34:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2055.2799999999997s)]
*  are not the most vulnerable. We are the most vulnerable, in particular women and children [[00:34:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2061.04s)]
*  who tend to be the victims of these gang members. People like Lake and Riley down in Georgia, like [[00:34:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2065.12s)]
*  Jocelyn Ngaro, 12 year old down in Texas. We've seen the names in the media. Those are the most [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2070.72s)]
*  vulnerable. That's what Trump is trying to do to protect the innocent Americans that are the prey [[00:34:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2076.4s)]
*  of these people who are being deported. I did ask Tulsi about the screening that's being done, [[00:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2080.88s)]
*  because the Democrats don't have you believe it's willy-nilly. [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2087.28s)]
*  Right. [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2090.08s)]
*  It's like you've got brown skin and the wrong tattoo, you're out. She explained that they are [[00:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2090.4s)]
*  identifying these Trenda Aragwa and MS-13 and even Sinaloa cartel members, [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2096.88s)]
*  largely with the help of the DEA, which is up to its neck in Gang Information 501. They know [[00:35:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2102.96s)]
*  who these guys are. They track them. They monitor them. All it needed was for somebody to call them [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2111.12s)]
*  up and say, who are they? Where are they? Figure out which ones are foreign. They're not all foreign [[00:35:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2117.04s)]
*  and which ones are American. On top of that, they have lengthy FBI investigations of these people. [[00:35:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2122.48s)]
*  I thought that was interesting too. It is not just like, gee, you're brown, you're out. [[00:35:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2128.56s)]
*  There was news about their most famous poster boy, Abrego Garcia, Kilmar Abrego Garcia yesterday, [[00:35:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2134.88s)]
*  the one who Chris Van Hollen had margaritas with. It turns out this guy, we knew that he had been [[00:35:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2140.48s)]
*  accused of beating his wife by his wife. Well, a second report came out of the same, more beatings, [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2145.84s)]
*  in which she saw a protective order, not just as previously reported in 2021, but earlier, [[00:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2151.52s)]
*  in August of 2020, she moved for a protective order back then. The details reveal a fight they had [[00:36:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2160.64s)]
*  with this woman, his wife, alleging that he took her phone, demanded her car keys before flying [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2167.52s)]
*  into a rage. She went upstairs to cook breakfast for the kids, but he shut off the stove, locked [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2172.8799999999997s)]
*  the children in their bedroom. They were crying. She got her phone from the car, called 911. He [[00:36:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2177.2s)]
*  locked her out of the house. He smashed her phone. She checked the boxes for acts of abuse, [[00:36:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2181.52s)]
*  including kicking, slapping, shoving, mental injury of a child, detaining against one's will. [[00:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2185.8399999999997s)]
*  She could hear the babies crying as he locked them in and he was after her. [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2191.3599999999997s)]
*  Me and my kids are afraid now. He kicked me, he pushed me, he slapped me in the face, [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2195.6s)]
*  he threatened me. I have photos of all the bruises left in my body. Police came, he acted violent [[00:36:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2199.04s)]
*  with them, broke my phone in front of them. I have a recording. He told my ex-mother-in-law [[00:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2203.76s)]
*  that even if he kills me, no one can do anything to him. In March of 2020, we now find out. [[00:36:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2207.76s)]
*  She said he pushed me against a wall. He broke a phone, a TV and damaged the walls. November of 19, [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2213.44s)]
*  he grabbed me by the hair in the car. December of 19, he grabbed me by the hair in the car. He [[00:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2217.84s)]
*  dragged me out of the car, leaving me in the street. And then she rescinded the motion for [[00:37:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2221.6000000000004s)]
*  the protective order as virtually all domestic violence abuse victims do. And on top of that, [[00:37:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2226.88s)]
*  there's another document from 2018 where her ex, so this is Abrego Garcia's wife now, [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2233.12s)]
*  but in 2018, his girlfriend, she had an ex-husband. His name is Edwin Trejo Ramos. [[00:37:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2239.2799999999997s)]
*  He's currently incarcerated in Maryland. This is all a very nice crowd. But he at the time saw [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2244.7999999999997s)]
*  at an emergency court hearing to get custody of his children with this woman saying, she tried [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2249.12s)]
*  to kill herself. She left the kids with an 11-year-old to take care of them. And I'm afraid [[00:37:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2256.0s)]
*  of my kids' lives being in danger because, quote, she is dating a gang member who was, [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2260.64s)]
*  at that time, we understand, Abrego Garcia. So this is the poster boy, [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2266.08s)]
*  the most vulnerable, Kamala Harris might say. Yeah. So in this case in particular, to me, [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2271.04s)]
*  in a weird way, crystallizes some of what I go through with the politics because [[00:37:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2278.16s)]
*  I actually get to a degree of a Democrat. Now, not him. And this is where I go on this. [[00:38:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2284.08s)]
*  For the Democrats and the guy from Maryland to fly down and meet with him and then make [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2290.16s)]
*  this guy the poster child, which I think most intelligent people can be like, this is a bad guy. [[00:38:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2294.48s)]
*  He's not a citizen. I want him out. That is what we want out of this country. It doesn't matter [[00:38:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2300.48s)]
*  the color of your skin. If you're not an American citizen and you have this rap in this track record. [[00:38:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2306.7999999999997s)]
*  And you've been deported. He had an order of removal. They just said, just not to El Salvador. [[00:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2312.64s)]
*  Now, so I agree with all that. So it, to me, when I saw the Maryland guy going to say, I'm like, [[00:38:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2317.52s)]
*  why, why is this guy, the guy you're going to take a stand for and fight for? Because we don't like, [[00:38:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2322.64s)]
*  he's a bad guy. But at the same time, I can, all that research, I can understand it even [[00:38:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2329.6s)]
*  with something like this. If you hit a doubt, you got to hit, you got about a thousand. If you're [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2336.8799999999997s)]
*  going to pick somebody and deport them. And if you just pick the wrong guy once with no due process, [[00:39:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2343.04s)]
*  nothing, that's a major issue. Like you append somebody, I don't even care. You say they're [[00:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2351.2s)]
*  an illegal, but they're like a great person. And they're actually contributing to me, just picking [[00:39:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2356.8s)]
*  them up, getting rid of them. That I'd have a problem with that. So, but you want them to have [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2362.0s)]
*  a hearing something due process. So where is that? The fact like they're, I'm not sympathizing with [[00:39:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2366.4s)]
*  Democrats or the guy from Maryland, because you're using the poster child of what Trump ran on. And [[00:39:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2372.96s)]
*  we want him out. And he got a hearing. Yes. He got a hearing when we deported him the first time. But [[00:39:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2377.84s)]
*  when you're doing it mass after, you just can't ever make a mistake. So I understand that logic [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2382.7200000000003s)]
*  a little bit, just not with this guy. No, you're reflecting the view of most Americans, according [[00:39:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2389.44s)]
*  to the latest polls, where they are in favor of Trump's plan, but they do want to see some due [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2393.92s)]
*  process. And it's hard. And how do you do that with so many people without, so not that one of [[00:39:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2397.52s)]
*  the things about politics, it's not always the easiest thing to come up with like an answer, [[00:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2403.2s)]
*  because you got to run a country and it's backed up. So what would happen? But I do, [[00:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2408.4s)]
*  Democrats constantly like, okay, this is an issue. I sort of the logic behind it, but you're not being [[00:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2414.32s)]
*  sincere when this is your poster child, because take out politics, there's nobody. You see this [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2420.88s)]
*  story a lot. All right, you can do this. You can go meet with him. Do you want him to be your next [[00:40:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2428.08s)]
*  door neighbor? Like, do you want him to be your next door neighbor? Or do you want him out of the [[00:40:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2431.6s)]
*  country? If that was it, you're either living next door or he's deported. Do you want him on the trail [[00:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2435.36s)]
*  when your 18 year old daughter goes for a run by herself? Exactly. And that is not that's based on [[00:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2440.56s)]
*  his rap sheet, nothing more in the gang stuff. So that's where they lose me because it's the [[00:40:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2446.08s)]
*  find me a way to make sure we can get 100%. But that guy is 100% based on the rap sheet. [[00:40:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2452.32s)]
*  And why this is where they put their flag in the mud. When the only dispute about this guy is the [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2459.36s)]
*  fact that he technically wasn't supposed to be deported to El Salvador, but he was ruled [[00:41:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2465.68s)]
*  deportable. The only reason he wasn't deported is because we were lame. We didn't have the resources [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2470.16s)]
*  and we didn't do it, which is the truth for 20 million illegals. The only controversial piece [[00:41:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2475.12s)]
*  about this guy is that his order of removal said just not to El Salvador because he's claiming he'll [[00:41:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2480.3199999999997s)]
*  get killed by gangs there. That's it. That's what they've thrown their lot behind. I do want to get [[00:41:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2485.12s)]
*  to the larger issue though. You're right over the target. How Americans are struggling with, [[00:41:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2489.3599999999997s)]
*  well, what is required? Because we know there was no due process when they came into the country [[00:41:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2494.08s)]
*  for us when it comes to our rights to be safe and not have to put them on the public dole and pay [[00:41:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2499.2799999999997s)]
*  for their lives and their health care and all this. However, here's the thing. They don't get [[00:41:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2504.16s)]
*  the same due process as an American citizen would before we took away their liberty in any way, [[00:41:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2509.2799999999997s)]
*  whether it's for trying to deport them for some reason or putting them through the criminal [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2514.7999999999997s)]
*  justice system. And what appears to be true in the immigration context, what is true is [[00:41:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2519.12s)]
*  it's a much lower level of quote due process that they're entitled to. And what most people don't [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2524.8799999999997s)]
*  know, including Terry Moran, who was one of the lead anchors over at ABC, and I'm going to show [[00:42:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2531.44s)]
*  you the sound bite of him and Trump, is that in many cases, no due process is okay. None. It's [[00:42:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2535.52s)]
*  under this thing called expedited removal, which all presidents have used. Trump expanded expedited [[00:42:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2544.56s)]
*  removal and you don't get any hearing under it. It was used even under Biden to say at the border, [[00:42:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2550.96s)]
*  if you show up, we can just turn you around. We don't have to give you a hearing. And the only [[00:42:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2557.7599999999998s)]
*  reason, the only way you get a hearing is if you say, no, no, no, I'm an asylum seeker. And that's [[00:42:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2562.48s)]
*  true under Trump too. But let me just show you Terry Moran, because who clearly has weighted in [[00:42:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2566.48s)]
*  to legal matters that he is not qualified to speak on because he tried understanding what I just [[00:42:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2571.52s)]
*  explained to be the law. Watch him try to pin down Trump. And Trump, I'm telling you, Trump is a [[00:42:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2577.12s)]
*  clever mofo. Just when you think he's like focused on like the UFC and like his polls, [[00:43:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2582.24s)]
*  he knows the nuances even of laws like this. Watch where he dodges on this attempt to pin him down. [[00:43:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2589.44s)]
*  He knows about expedited removal. He knows about the lower standard on due process. [[00:43:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2596.96s)]
*  And he doesn't allow Terry Moran one inch. It's sought nine. [[00:43:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2601.2799999999997s)]
*  Do you acknowledge that under our law, every single person who gets deported [[00:43:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2605.28s)]
*  gets a hearing first to make their case? Well, are we talking about people that are citizens [[00:43:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2611.84s)]
*  of our country or not? No, you're not deporting citizens at this point. Well, let me ask you, [[00:43:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2616.8s)]
*  did they get hearings when Biden allowed 21 million, because I think the number is 20 million [[00:43:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2620.96s)]
*  people to flow into our country? But did we give them a hearing when they came in? Well, [[00:43:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2627.52s)]
*  the law requires that every single person who is going to be deported gets a hearing first. [[00:43:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2632.24s)]
*  Well, I'll have to ask the lawyers about that. All I can say is this. If you're going to have 21 [[00:43:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2638.24s)]
*  million people and we have to get a lot of them out, the law is the law, sir. The law is the law. [[00:44:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2644.16s)]
*  And you're saying anything about trials? No, not trials, hearings. These people came in, [[00:44:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2648.72s)]
*  they're not citizens. They came in illegally. They came into our country illegally. We have to [[00:44:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2653.52s)]
*  get them out. There's a legal process for that. Sure, and we follow the legal process. I can't [[00:44:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2658.32s)]
*  have a trial, a major trial for every person that came in illegally. We have thousands of [[00:44:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2664.0s)]
*  murderers that came in. We have to get them out. They're bad guys. They're really bad guys. But in [[00:44:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2670.8s)]
*  our country, even bad guys get due process, right? If people come into our country illegally, there's [[00:44:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2676.56s)]
*  a different standard. These are illegal. They came in illegally. But they get due process. [[00:44:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2682.8s)]
*  Well, they get a process where we have to get them out. Trump was right with every word. [[00:44:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2688.2400000000002s)]
*  Terry Moran was in the wrong. I don't know whether he's a lawyer or not. I am. I practiced law for [[00:44:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2696.0800000000004s)]
*  10 years and covered the Supreme Court for three. It is not true that everybody gets a hearing. It [[00:45:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2700.1600000000003s)]
*  is not the law. Just Google. Go ahead and don't take my word. Google expedited removal. To me, [[00:45:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2705.1200000000003s)]
*  it's not even necessarily a legal issue. It becomes a little bit, for me, a human issue [[00:45:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2709.92s)]
*  in the sense of I get it. They came in the country illegally. But that's our fault. That's our fault, [[00:45:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2718.32s)]
*  to a degree, for not having the right setup. And if I'm having a horrible life somewhere else, [[00:45:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2725.04s)]
*  and I know I can get into this country, and it's like, well, the guys before me, [[00:45:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2729.92s)]
*  they were wrong. They set this up, and you didn't get in fairly. And you've been living a very [[00:45:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2735.28s)]
*  productive life here, and you've made the most of it to append it and send it. I'm not saying that's [[00:45:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2741.6s)]
*  what we're going through. That just goes back to my, you better be right. I'm not saying that's [[00:45:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2747.2s)]
*  the legal. Trump may have every legal argument to be like, sorry, you're gone. But reversing time to [[00:45:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2752.4s)]
*  be like, well, you shouldn't have gotten in here. And even though you came for the right reasons, [[00:46:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2761.76s)]
*  the American dream and all this stuff, now you're gone because the last guy shouldn't. That's where [[00:46:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2766.2400000000002s)]
*  I get. So you just got to be right. And I don't know how to do it because he's right. The trials, [[00:46:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2770.88s)]
*  the time, all of it. And it's just a moral issue that I wrestle with a little bit. [[00:46:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2775.28s)]
*  I hear you. I'm definitely further to the right than you are on it, but I totally get your point. [[00:46:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2778.88s)]
*  I'll also say that this is another reason why Trump is using the Alien Enemies Act, because [[00:46:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2783.44s)]
*  under the Alien Enemies Act, the amount of due process one would get before being ejected [[00:46:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2788.72s)]
*  is down to its most minuscule level. And even the Supreme Court intimated that the first time it [[00:46:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2793.6s)]
*  looked at this saying some level of due process. They clearly understand it's not going to be [[00:46:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2798.0s)]
*  as robust as the ACLU wants it to be. And even full circle to the original, [[00:46:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2804.08s)]
*  the guy, the gang guy who got El Salvador, hearing how I feel, you just heard and you're like, well, [[00:46:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2810.08s)]
*  I'm more right than you are. The way they've treated that guy has once again pushed me right. [[00:46:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2816.32s)]
*  It's like, that's who I want out of the country. And if you're going to fight that, well, like, [[00:47:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2821.52s)]
*  you're losing somebody who theoretically is more maybe center, almost leftish, but I want those [[00:47:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2825.84s)]
*  people out of the country. So for the Democrats to again make a circus and just political this, [[00:47:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2831.84s)]
*  what are you doing going to meet with this guy? Like, that's what drives me crazy. [[00:47:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2838.48s)]
*  Yet you didn't go and meet with the family of Rachel Moran, who was killed in your state. [[00:47:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2842.64s)]
*  And they're not standing at. [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2847.2s)]
*  By a different illegal. Here is Stephen Miller took to the White House podium [[00:47:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2847.92s)]
*  yesterday and spoke about the Jocelyn Nungare case, which I met with a 12 year old girl in Texas [[00:47:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2853.04s)]
*  and just ripped it. Watch. [[00:47:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2857.04s)]
*  Most of your papers never covered her story when it happened. To the extent that you covered it at [[00:47:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2858.96s)]
*  all, it was because President Trump forced you to cover it by highlighting it repeatedly over and [[00:47:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2863.68s)]
*  over again. He had to shame you into covering it. And each and every one of you decides over [[00:47:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2871.2s)]
*  and over again with these MS 13 terrorists, to the extent that you had the financial means to do so, [[00:47:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2876.8799999999997s)]
*  you all choose to live in condos or homes or houses as far away from these kinds of gang [[00:48:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2881.6s)]
*  bangers as you possibly can. If I offered any one of you a rent free home with no taxes to pay [[00:48:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2887.2799999999997s)]
*  in any of these gang neighborhoods, and I said, your neighbors are MS 13 terrorists or Mexican [[00:48:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2893.3599999999997s)]
*  mafia or Sinaloa cartel or train. I couldn't pay you to live there, but yet you with your [[00:48:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2898.16s)]
*  coverage are trying to force innocent Americans to have these people as their neighbors. [[00:48:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2905.2s)]
*  And that one day their daughter may be abducted from their home and raped and murdered. So you're [[00:48:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2909.2s)]
*  not going to get an ounce of sympathy from this administration or president Trump for the terrorists [[00:48:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2913.6s)]
*  who've invaded our homes in our country. He's so good. Yeah. I mean, it's a fair point. [[00:48:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2918.08s)]
*  I that's that's softening you at all. I'm so with him on that. That that goes back to when I said, [[00:48:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2925.2s)]
*  if you said they're your neighbor, there's a lot there's a lot of hypocritical. It's easy [[00:48:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2930.72s)]
*  when you're sitting in your white ivory tower to say, you know, your idealistic world of way you [[00:48:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2935.12s)]
*  want the world to exist. But when the rubber meets the road, they would probably privately say a lot [[00:49:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2940.96s)]
*  of different things, do different things. Rachel Moran's mom was talking about how she went for a [[00:49:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2946.56s)]
*  jog on a trail that they always walk together. It wasn't like some risky trail. It wasn't the [[00:49:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2952.0s)]
*  dark of night. It was during the day. They'd done it a thousand times together as a family. [[00:49:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2958.64s)]
*  It's like our way of life is actively being changed, corrupted, actually ruined. Her mom's [[00:49:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2965.12s)]
*  life is changed forever, right? By these people. And so it's like, I have to tell you, I have like [[00:49:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2972.08s)]
*  zero empathy. And I'm sorry that the ones who came, even though it was illegal, and didn't hurt [[00:49:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2977.68s)]
*  anybody, but like actually tried to like blend in and get jobs have got to go to, but they do. I [[00:49:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2983.36s)]
*  think they all have got to go. And then if they go, Trump said, if you go now, you can come back in. [[00:49:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2987.6s)]
*  But if you just if you stay, and then we find out that you overstayed, you're never coming back into [[00:49:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=2992.64s)]

*  president and founder of Barstool Sports, otherwise known as El Presidente. Katy Perry, [[00:51:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3115.44s)]
*  among others, receiving major backlash, not for taking the flight, but for how they behaved [[00:52:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3122.64s)]
*  afterward like they actually were Alan Shepard and Neil Armstrong. And so she's come out to say [[00:52:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3128.88s)]
*  she's feeling battered and bruised by the backlash via variety, that the internet is a dumping ground [[00:52:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3135.04s)]
*  for unhinged and unhealed people. But she has resolved, Dave, to keep looking to the light [[00:52:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3142.2400000000002s)]
*  because she doesn't want to be further damaged by these unhealed people. [[00:52:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3149.12s)]
*  She's right. The internet is filled with unhinged lunatics. But when you do this little outer space [[00:52:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3154.08s)]
*  mission, that can happen. And I'm not going to lose my sleep worrying about Katy Perry's feelings. [[00:52:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3160.56s)]
*  But she is right. It's filled with unhinged lunatics. It is. But those are not the ones who [[00:52:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3165.92s)]
*  are attacking her. No, I'm sure she's getting it all sides. And I'm not, again, like, what are you [[00:52:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3169.84s)]
*  going to do? To me, it's just so, it's just right on brand to go up there and act like you're Alan [[00:52:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3173.92s)]
*  Shepard. And then when people are like, would you calm down? You took a vanity flight to outer space [[00:52:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3178.32s)]
*  thanks to Jeff Bezos. That cost a million dollars a seat. And stop saying, Gale King, have you been? [[00:53:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3183.36s)]
*  Literally no one's been. It costs a million dollars. Shut up. And then when people have [[00:53:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3188.32s)]
*  that reaction to you to act like, I will not be bruised by you broken people. I will go toward [[00:53:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3192.0s)]
*  the, just stop talking. Just stop. But somebody like that is so out of touch with reality because [[00:53:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3197.76s)]
*  they've been a star and big. I feel like if you get a celebrity like that, what? One or two is [[00:53:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3203.6000000000004s)]
*  going to have any ground in any reality. They're living in a fantasy world. So nothing is real. [[00:53:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3210.0s)]
*  I'm actually surprised the internet can actually get to them. I didn't know where they on X [[00:53:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3215.7599999999998s)]
*  checking like comments. That surprised me a little bit. Yeah. So that is a little surprising, but [[00:53:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3220.0s)]
*  yeah, you get to a level of coddled superstar status where you just lose track of reality. [[00:53:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3225.2799999999997s)]
*  We have some news on Meghan Markle, which we'll get to in just a bit. But before we leave hard [[00:53:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3232.3199999999997s)]
*  news, because yeah, Katy Perry's hard news, but I forgot to mention this thing about Pete Hegseth. [[00:53:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3237.52s)]
*  So there's been a lot of speculation that he's going to go. Mike Wallace, for those just joining [[00:54:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3243.2s)]
*  us, is reportedly out as national security advisor, along with his top deputy, Alex Wong, [[00:54:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3247.04s)]
*  a man who's been underneath him there since he was sworn in and some others too. You heard Mark [[00:54:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3252.7999999999997s)]
*  Halpern reporting that it's going to be a lot of the staff that there's reportedly disarray over [[00:54:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3258.96s)]
*  there. We don't know what the full story is, but we will. So there's speculation about whether Pete [[00:54:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3263.6s)]
*  Hegseth is going to be forced out as secretary of defense. And I wanted to say this, so I love [[00:54:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3267.28s)]
*  Mark Halpern and he's been doing great in his new podcast, but he reported yesterday on Hegseth [[00:54:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3273.92s)]
*  and there was a bit of information in there involving yours truly, and I want to speak to it. So watch [[00:54:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3280.0s)]
*  this. Pete Hegseth, okay? The story's about him. There's still some ambiguity about the facts, [[00:54:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3285.44s)]
*  but people in MAGA pretend there's not a problem. And he's done a very good job of playing by the [[00:54:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3291.52s)]
*  rules that the president expects of being aggressive. What I can report here today is that [[00:54:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3296.8s)]
*  his standing in the administration is not as solid as some people believe, and as the president [[00:55:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3301.92s)]
*  and the White House press secretary have tried to signal. There are people at the senior-most levels [[00:55:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3308.0800000000004s)]
*  of this administration, not counting the president necessarily, but the senior-most levels under him [[00:55:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3312.7200000000003s)]
*  who believe that the next time Pete Hegseth makes a mistake or is exposed to have made a mistake, [[00:55:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3318.48s)]
*  he needs to go. And there are already plans underway to figure that out. Now, what are the [[00:55:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3323.52s)]
*  public clues to that? Because MAGA has been pretty supportive of Pete Hegseth. Two people who are part [[00:55:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3328.32s)]
*  of the very strong outside support group of the president, Tucker Carlson and Megan Kelly here at [[00:55:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3334.96s)]
*  the Megan Kelly Network, they've both now done interviews with the advisors who were forced out [[00:55:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3342.56s)]
*  of their Pentagon jobs and who both have said things about Pete Hegseth that are not fully [[00:55:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3348.4s)]
*  supportive. They like him, they're close to him, but they both have made it clear that they see [[00:55:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3354.56s)]
*  real problems in his governance and his stewardship at the Pentagon. That's a clue, and I keep being [[00:55:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3358.48s)]
*  pointed to that clue by folks to say, if two allies of the president and two people very close to [[00:56:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3363.76s)]
*  Pete Hegseth, Megan and Tucker, are doing these interviews, something is afoot. [[00:56:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3368.88s)]
*  Okay, fair enough. I understand why people are making that calculation. [[00:56:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3373.36s)]
*  Are you in that category? You're very public strong? Are you like? [[00:56:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3379.2000000000003s)]
*  Yeah, I'm a friend of Pete's and I supported his nomination and thought what they were going to do [[00:56:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3383.04s)]
*  to him. And Trump. [[00:56:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3387.6800000000003s)]
*  And Trump's. Yeah, Trump too, totally. But I just want to say, in my case, I can't speak for Tucker, [[00:56:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3388.0s)]
*  but that's not true. Like I in no way put on Colin Carroll, one of the fired accused leakers, [[00:56:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3393.6800000000003s)]
*  he denies being one completely in an effort to undermine Pete or get rid of Pete or because [[00:56:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3401.28s)]
*  my MAGA connections or sensitivities are telling me Pete's teetering and I'm trying to push him [[00:56:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3407.28s)]
*  over the edge. Totally not the case at all. I'm just a news person. And they actually came to me [[00:56:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3412.1600000000003s)]
*  and asked me if they could come on. Originally it was all three of them. And then two of them got [[00:56:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3417.92s)]
*  tapped on the shoulder by their lawyers, which I understand. But Colin was like, I'm doing it. [[00:57:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3422.2400000000002s)]
*  So I'm fine. Great. I mean, I'll interview Pete. I'll interview the guy Pete fired. I'll interview [[00:57:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3427.2s)]
*  pretty much anybody you want to put in front of me unless I have a personal loathing for them. [[00:57:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3432.0s)]
*  So just to make it clear that no one should be reading anything into what I know or what I want [[00:57:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3436.16s)]
*  based on the fact that I interviewed Colin. [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3442.08s)]
*  That would be a pretty big 180. They just publicly like last week, weren't they? Like it's all, [[00:57:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3442.72s)]
*  there's no, all the rumors are false and he's in great standing. [[00:57:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3447.2799999999997s)]
*  Yeah. Well, and even Trump in that Terry Moran interview, he spoke to it. Well, [[00:57:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3450.3199999999997s)]
*  you tell me what you think of how he answered the question on Pete. You've got it, Deb. We'll watch [[00:57:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3454.48s)]
*  it here. You said the other day that you had a talk with the secretary. Did you take him to the [[00:57:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3460.2400000000002s)]
*  woodshed? I had a talk with him and whatever I said, I probably wouldn't be inclined to tell you, [[00:57:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3466.2400000000002s)]
*  but we had a good talk. He's a talented guy. He's young, smart, highly educated. [[00:57:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3474.64s)]
*  And I think he's gonna be a very good defense, hopefully a great defense secretary, but he'll [[00:58:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3480.48s)]
*  be a very good defense secretary. You have 100% confidence in- [[00:58:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3486.2400000000002s)]
*  I don't have 100% confidence in anything. Okay, anything. Do I have 100%? It's a stupid question. [[00:58:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3489.44s)]
*  Look- It's a pretty important position. [[00:58:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3497.36s)]
*  I have none. No, you don't have 100%. Only a liar would say I have 100% confidence. I [[00:58:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3499.28s)]
*  don't have 100% confidence that we're gonna finish this interview. [[00:58:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3506.2400000000002s)]
*  That to me was, by the way, that's why people like Trump the way he answered that, but he [[00:58:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3511.36s)]
*  definitely took him to the woodshed. He definitely took him to the woodshed and probably said, [[00:58:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3518.4s)]
*  if you embarrass me or the administration on a major level one more time, you're gone. I [[00:58:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3521.92s)]
*  don't want that. I think he likes him and does not want to get rid of him, but he's clear like, [[00:58:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3527.2s)]
*  strike two has happened. I think that would be the vibe of the conversation. [[00:58:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3532.88s)]
*  I think that's fair. Yeah, that's fair. And that's a fair way, by the way, [[00:58:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3536.4s)]
*  to talk to somebody. I've had to fire people at Barstool who I like, but if you're just [[00:59:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3540.4s)]
*  dumb and you keep screwing up, I'm not gonna lose sleep over your incompetence as much as I [[00:59:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3548.96s)]
*  want to keep you. I'm not saying that's Pete, but I'm saying- As a leader. [[00:59:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3554.0s)]
*  At some point, it doesn't matter your personal feelings. If you keep screwing up, you gotta go. [[00:59:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3557.84s)]
*  What will get you fired at Barstool? You really have to- [[00:59:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3562.0s)]
*  Just try. You really have to be super, super dumb. [[00:59:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3564.96s)]
*  Very few things. We recently teetered. There was a big news story. There was a vicious rumor of [[00:59:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3568.56s)]
*  old miss co-ed slept with her boyfriend's dad. Went crazy viral. Crazy viral. We had an idiot [[00:59:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3577.52s)]
*  who talked about it as though it was fact. I knew it wasn't fact right away. I actually [[00:59:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3586.96s)]
*  thought we were keeping it off, but we posted it for seven minutes. Gets us in all sorts of trouble. [[00:59:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3591.6s)]
*  This kid's a moron. Shut out, Nicky smokes. No redeemable value really to us, but I do like him [[00:59:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3595.68s)]
*  and he tries hard. He's just dumb. That almost got him fired. [[01:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3602.3199999999997s)]
*  Oh my God. He's gonna be working for you when you're talking about it like this. [[01:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3605.44s)]
*  Well, it's the truth. [[01:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3607.9199999999996s)]
*  This is somebody who you stayed, who you kept. [[01:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3608.64s)]
*  Yeah, he works for us. [[01:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3610.3199999999997s)]
*  It's good to be benevolent on a big mistake though, because if you can be, [[01:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3612.3999999999996s)]
*  he'll never do something like that again. [[01:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3616.0s)]
*  Well, unless you're so stupid that you can't prevent it despite your best. [[01:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3617.6s)]
*  We're not hiring the secretary of defense. These are, we're Barstool Sports. We're blogging, [[01:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3623.8399999999997s)]
*  talking sports. So sometimes, intelligence isn't necessarily the top requirement for us. [[01:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3628.64s)]
*  Okay. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3634.48s)]
*  It's being entertaining. [[01:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3634.96s)]
*  I got it. Fair enough. Well, it's a world that's very foreign to me. Very foreign to me. So you're [[01:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3636.88s)]
*  gonna have to walk me through our next two segments here. We gotta talk about Bill Belichick. [[01:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3641.2799999999997s)]
*  You ripped him. [[01:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3645.7599999999998s)]
*  I thought it was elder abuse. Honestly, what I saw there was Dr. Jill. It had Dr. Jill vibes. [[01:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3647.6s)]
*  This overly aggressive, younger partner who's in this like, apparently he looked infirm to me, [[01:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3653.04s)]
*  the way he was answering those questions. Like, man, who's being taken advantage of. [[01:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3659.2799999999997s)]
*  And all I could think was his family needs to do an intervention and get this woman off of his back. [[01:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3663.7599999999998s)]
*  But can you set the stage for us on like, what's happening with this guy? [[01:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3667.2s)]
*  I'll start by saying I am a diehard New England Patriots fan. [[01:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3670.32s)]
*  Yeah, you're from Boston. [[01:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3673.7599999999998s)]
*  Diehard. I love Bill Belichick. He's like, my guy has brought so many championships. [[01:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3675.2799999999997s)]
*  I know him personally. He lives on Nantucket. I live on Nantucket. I've met Jordan. So it's a [[01:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3679.44s)]
*  very awkward thing to see. I also watch that show, CBS Sunday Morning, with the interview. [[01:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3685.2000000000003s)]
*  It's like my feel good show. I just like it. I like nature. There's some politics, whatever. [[01:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3690.4s)]
*  But for the most part, that is a drink your coffee, eat your bagel, feel good show. So I [[01:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3695.6s)]
*  was not expecting this interview. I was squirming. I don't know what to expect. I don't know what to [[01:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3701.68s)]
*  think about it. It certainly was awkward. I've heard people say, you know, is she taking advantage [[01:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3707.36s)]
*  of him? Well, he's taking advantage of her. He's sleeping with a very attractive young girl, 50 [[01:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3715.6s)]
*  years younger. I don't know why she's so involved. Like, I really don't. I've met her. She's nice [[01:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3719.92s)]
*  enough. She's running the whole show. I've known that a couple months ago. How so? Like she, every [[01:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3728.0s)]
*  piece of Bill Belichick business goes through her. Like she is basically, she would act, [[01:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3733.92s)]
*  like if that was maybe not in a romantic relationship and that's his PR manager. [[01:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3740.56s)]
*  Or like an agent. [[01:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3747.28s)]
*  Yeah. Nobody's blinking at that. Like that happens, I'm sure a lot with celebrities. We're not going [[01:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3748.16s)]
*  to talk about it. Now you combine it with Bill Belichick, who's gruff with the media and generally [[01:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3752.64s)]
*  always handles himself. It's just a very awkward situation. The age gap is huge, clearly, but she [[01:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3757.2000000000003s)]
*  runs the show. There's rumors, hard knocks for HBO was supposed to do North Carolina. She shut that [[01:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3762.96s)]
*  down. That's where he's the coach now. Yeah. He's the coach there. So it's just, it's such a [[01:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3768.7200000000003s)]
*  juxtaposition of a guy who seemingly had no media savvy, but was always just straight forward, [[01:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3775.6s)]
*  no time for the media. Now having his life run by a 25 year old, it certainly is eye opening for a [[01:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3784.16s)]
*  guy like me. I also know I'm going to run into probably them and then tuck in and not only carrying [[01:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3790.48s)]
*  my watermelon out of stop and shop, and I don't want it to be an awkward conversation. [[01:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3796.08s)]
*  Just blame it all on me. [[01:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3800.0s)]
*  But it went super viral. I mean, it's all anybody's talking about. It's all, [[01:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3801.84s)]
*  because it's just such a departure from how a sports fan, patriot fan, [[01:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3806.8s)]
*  everybody thought of Bill Belichick. [[01:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3811.68s)]
*  So explain that to me because we watch that I come into this like at a left field. I know who he is, [[01:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3813.76s)]
*  of course, even I know who Bill Belichick is. He's the greatest coach of all time. [[01:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3818.48s)]
*  But I don't follow his, you know, I didn't know about the girlfriend and all that. [[01:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3821.12s)]
*  To me, he looked out of it, like he seemed confused, but I've never ever seen him give an interview. [[01:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3826.0s)]
*  Yeah. So I've seen a lot of people like he's wearing a holey sweatshirt. That's what he does. [[01:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3831.6s)]
*  Like that, that is his look. Does he talk like that? Like, does he look confused generally? [[01:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3835.6s)]
*  He generally, if he doesn't want to answer a question, he grumbles and he says, I'm not [[01:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3840.72s)]
*  going to answer that. He's famous for not answering questions. He's never media savvy. [[01:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3844.56s)]
*  Him going on a book tour, which is what he was doing, seems like the last thing he would ever do [[01:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3849.2799999999997s)]
*  in a million years. If she wasn't there, I would anticipate him just being like, [[01:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3854.96s)]
*  I'm not going to answer it. He's, he's rarely conducting interviews that he has no interest. [[01:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3860.96s)]
*  He just doesn't care for the media or what they think. The thing that he said that was the most [[01:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3866.64s)]
*  accurate is probably like, I don't care what people think about me. And clearly he doesn't, [[01:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3870.64s)]
*  but I've never seen him defer to anybody like that. That is the most shocking. Yeah. Like if [[01:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3875.2799999999997s)]
*  someone else is speaking for him, that never happens. He speaks for himself loudly through [[01:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3882.8799999999997s)]
*  his actions clearly and is always like a general in the commander of the room, really. So to see [[01:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3888.08s)]
*  him basically give what appears to be control of his life to her is shocking. Any? [[01:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3895.04s)]
*  Most of the audience has probably seen the clip by now, but just in case they haven't, [[01:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3902.88s)]
*  let's play it for them. Let's play the one where she interrupts. This is a Bill Belichick on CBS [[01:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3905.04s)]
*  this morning with anchor Tony Doka pool and his 24 year old girlfriend who's 49 years younger than [[01:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3909.2s)]
*  he is interrupting the interview. Watch. The other change for Belichick is 24 year old [[01:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3916.8s)]
*  Jordan Hudson, his creative muse as he writes in his book. Jordan was a constant presence during [[01:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3923.2s)]
*  our interview. You have Jordan right over there. Everybody in the world seems to be following this [[01:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3932.3999999999996s)]
*  relationship. They've got an opinion about your private life. It's got nothing to do with them, [[01:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3938.3999999999996s)]
*  but they're invested in it. How do you deal with that? Never been too worried about what everybody [[01:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3942.24s)]
*  else thinks. Just try to do what I feel like is best for me and what's right. How did you guys meet [[01:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3948.16s)]
*  not talking about this? No, no, it's a topic. Neither one of them is comfortable commenting on. [[01:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3954.08s)]
*  Okay. So now she said, how did you meet? And she interjects not count commenting about this. [[01:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3962.24s)]
*  And there are reports that she actually interjected multiple times. CBS only chose to show the one [[01:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3967.04s)]
*  just to give the audience a true sense of what, how this thing went down. And it's about the book. [[01:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3972.7999999999997s)]
*  And to CBS as a defense sheet, that quote that he, she is the muse is in the book. [[01:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3977.28s)]
*  It's in the book. Yeah, exactly. So now this fight started unfolding online. This is via the daily [[01:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3983.2000000000003s)]
*  mail involving Belichick's daughter-in-law. She's married to his son and her name is Jennifer. [[01:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3989.28s)]
*  She's married to his son, Steve Belichick. Some people were defending Jordan, the girlfriend. [[01:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=3995.1200000000003s)]
*  For example, somebody posted, Oh, former New England Patriot star, Julian Edelman. [[01:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4002.4s)]
*  Saw that. You know him. Stuck up for her saying she was merely acting how any PR person would. [[01:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4007.92s)]
*  Comedian Nikki Glaser also defended Hudson saying 100%. She's acting as his publicist. Publicists [[01:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4013.44s)]
*  do this during interviews. People are out for blood. And first of all, I'll tell you what Jennifer, [[01:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4019.92s)]
*  the daughter-in-law said, but I have done countless interviews, countless. I've both given as the [[01:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4024.6400000000003s)]
*  subject of them and done conducted literally has this never, I've never seen this happen. Never. [[01:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4030.48s)]
*  The PR people will come to you before the interview and they will beg you not to cover or ask after [[01:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4037.12s)]
*  for it to be cut. Yes, exactly. That's their job as a journalist. And Tony Doka pool is a journalist. [[01:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4044.32s)]
*  You would say thank you for your input. That's it. You would never make a promise ever. It's [[01:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4049.84s)]
*  literally considered unethical to say, I won't ask about that. You know, at most I've ever heard [[01:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4055.28s)]
*  somebody say is we can't make you any promises, but you know, we're not that interested in that [[01:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4059.92s)]
*  subject. Like a wink and a nap. But never, never has a PR person ever interviewed, interjected into [[01:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4064.48s)]
*  an interview. In the middle of it. No, we get people asking, if someone doesn't want to talk [[01:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4071.52s)]
*  about it, we generally want, because people generally want to talk about what you are asking [[01:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4075.12s)]
*  not to talk about. So we won't do it. It's strange. I don't agree with that. It was different rules. [[01:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4078.7200000000003s)]
*  If it's like a host, you know what I mean? If you're sitting to somebody who doesn't consider [[01:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4084.4s)]
*  themselves a journalist, very different. And by the way, this is how talk shows get away with it [[01:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4087.52s)]
*  all the time. I've been asked to go on a bunch of talk shows, including Tamron Hall's like five [[01:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4090.72s)]
*  years ago. And her executive producer said, we'll give you all the questions in advance. I'm like, [[01:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4095.36s)]
*  I'm not doing that. I felt like I don't want that. Yeah, right. So she got away with it because they [[01:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4099.68s)]
*  consider that a talk show, but she's not, I guess, calling herself a journalist anymore, at least [[01:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4104.16s)]
*  wasn't for that show. Okay. So then Jennifer Belichick's daughter-in-law- I'm dying to hear this. [[01:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4108.0s)]
*  Ways in and says publicists act in a professional matter and do not storm on storm offset, [[01:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4112.64s)]
*  delaying an interview. Yeah. So I know them too. This is like, and that probably tells you [[01:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4120.400000000001s)]
*  everything you need to know about how the family and that's natural. There's a story that came out [[01:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4127.04s)]
*  in the New York post, I think yesterday that she accumulated like $10 million of real estate very [[01:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4131.280000000001s)]
*  quickly. So I'm sure the family based on that quote is a little like, what is going on here? [[01:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4136.0s)]
*  And it's just, this is a guy that is not a pushover. He has built his reputation on being like [[01:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4141.2s)]
*  a gruff kind of guy who needs everything particular and detail oriented. It's just very [[01:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4146.8s)]
*  strange to see. He's the guy Tim Walz was trying to convince us he was. No jazz hands, football. [[01:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4153.76s)]
*  He was the guy. Yeah. He was trying to, I think, be more like a grunt guy, but who knows? Well, [[01:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4162.64s)]
*  there's more. So he, you know about this because I saw you commented on it. So Bill Belichick [[01:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4168.96s)]
*  posted a statement on the UNC University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill is where he coaches, [[01:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4175.04s)]
*  right? Chapel Hill. And he wrote as follows, I agreed to speak with CBS Sunday morning to promote [[01:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4181.84s)]
*  my new book, The Art of Winning. Prior to the interview, I clearly communicated with my [[01:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4187.12s)]
*  publicist. So he's not even saying he told Tony Doka pool or the CBS publicist. I clearly [[01:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4191.92s)]
*  communicated with my publicist at Simon & Schuster that any promotional interviews I participated in [[01:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4196.88s)]
*  would agree to focus solely on the contents of the book. Unfortunately, that expectation was not [[01:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4201.92s)]
*  honored during the interview. I was surprised when unrelated topics were introduced and I [[01:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4205.92s)]
*  repeatedly expressed to the reporter, Tony Doka pool and the producers that I preferred to keep [[01:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4210.16s)]
*  the conversation centered on the book. After this occurred several times, Jordan, with whom I share [[01:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4214.32s)]
*  both the personal and professional relationship, stepped in to reiterate that point and help refocus [[01:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4218.400000000001s)]
*  the discussion. She was not deflecting any specific question or topic. I'm sorry, Bill, [[01:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4221.92s)]
*  but she was, but was simply doing her job to ensure the interview stayed on track. [[01:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4226.0s)]
*  Some of the clips made it appear as though we were avoiding the question of how we met, [[01:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4230.08s)]
*  but we've been open about the fact that Jordan and I met on a flight to Palm Beach in 2021 [[01:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4232.56s)]
*  and goes on for them saying these are just selectively edited clips, suggested a false [[01:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4236.8s)]
*  narrative that Jordan was attempting to control the conversation, which is simply not true. [[01:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4242.24s)]
*  Yeah, I'm like white knuckling the table. In my years following Bill Belichick, [[01:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4246.799999999999s)]
*  I would say my knowledge of him, there's roughly 0% chance he wrote that. He just doesn't care, [[01:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4254.5599999999995s)]
*  generally, what anyone thinks about him. So to go write that, that my guess would be Jordan wrote [[01:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4263.599999999999s)]
*  that the fact that it is on the North Carolina website is insane. Right. It's just insane. [[01:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4269.759999999999s)]
*  It's shocking. Again, it's I'm speaking to all Patriot fans, Boston people, this guy, like, [[01:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4277.44s)]
*  if you could have predicted this, people would say you're living in a bizarre world. It's just [[01:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4285.919999999999s)]
*  so strange in this long email, crazy, the public statement, crazy, but I'm not even sure [[01:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4289.839999999999s)]
*  he knows that was written. Right. Like he may not. He may not. I really don't know. [[01:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4297.2s)]
*  So the Daily Mail had a comprehensive piece and they cited the New York Post as reporting even [[01:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4302.5599999999995s)]
*  before this past weekend's interview, Belichick's friends shaking their heads about his relationship [[01:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4308.0s)]
*  with Jordan. Quote, they're talking to him about her, but very gently because they know how deep [[01:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4312.799999999999s)]
*  in it he is. She saw an opening and she took it. An insider added of how she has inserted herself [[01:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4316.959999999999s)]
*  into every aspect of his life and career. Consensus among people around Belichick, another source said, [[01:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4322.08s)]
*  is that this relationship is alarming and Hudson is a runaway train. However, they include one person [[01:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4326.4s)]
*  defending them saying, when it comes to the situation in it is just a moment in time, [[01:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4331.52s)]
*  he and Jordan are fine. Nobody should be concerned at this point. But then they also say multiple [[01:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4336.8s)]
*  reports say UNC is growing uneasy with her involvement in everything. Yeah. So [[01:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4341.52s)]
*  there's an adage in sports, winning cures everything. If North Carolina wins, [[01:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4349.360000000001s)]
*  people are going to forget this. Yeah. And North Carolina will be happy and look the other way. [[01:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4356.160000000001s)]
*  If North Carolina has a bad season, it's going to get very rocky. It is not, I don't think normal [[01:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4359.76s)]
*  for a relatively new relationship with this age gap, with the aid of someone coming in running [[01:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4366.56s)]
*  his entire life and like CBS and Hard Knock supposedly got canceled because of her. [[01:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4373.4400000000005s)]
*  It's just shocking. It's just shocking. There's all being fought and headlines and rumors and back [[01:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4378.24s)]
*  and forth. And by the way, to Jordan's credit, she's, if you want to say credit, she's not taking [[01:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4383.92s)]
*  steps backwards. Like every time a story comes out, she's pushing forwards. Like she is, [[01:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4388.16s)]
*  she is not a tame flower. She is not running from this at all. She's running from how they met. [[01:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4393.92s)]
*  That seems clear. And in my opinion, they did not quote meet on a plane. I think they did because [[01:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4399.92s)]
*  I think they laid eyes on each other in person for the first time on a plane, but she's so [[01:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4406.32s)]
*  defensive about it. There's something more to the story. I don't know what it was. Was it only fans? [[01:13:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4410.8s)]
*  Was it some set up by a matchmaker? I think they're telling the truth. I just think she's [[01:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4415.12s)]
*  in control in her mind. She's like, we said we're not talking about that. We're not talking about [[01:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4420.32s)]
*  it because from the second I met them, the story has been told the same to me. She posted how they [[01:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4424.64s)]
*  met a long time ago. I know, but that's a front. If they met through, she's Fauci to you. She's a [[01:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4429.92s)]
*  criminal. She's like a criminal mastermind. I view her the same way I viewed Anna Nicole Smith. Like [[01:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4436.64s)]
*  everyone understands what the deal here is. He's an older guy with money and power, which [[01:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4443.04s)]
*  some women find if not attractive, worthy of being with. They can upgrade their lifestyle. [[01:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4447.6s)]
*  They're going to travel the world. And the old guy gets some young, beautiful woman on his arm [[01:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4452.8s)]
*  and probably a lot of hot sex he otherwise wouldn't be having. Yeah. I mean, could he not? Could he [[01:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4457.44s)]
*  not just get hookers if he didn't want? I don't know. I mean, Anna Nicole, I don't remember. That [[01:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4464.0s)]
*  guy was like on his desk. He was like 200 years old. Yeah. He couldn't even get up. Like Belichick [[01:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4468.4s)]
*  is still outside of this, seems to be normally functioning. I have a new 24 year old girl wants [[01:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4472.72s)]
*  a 74 year old man. I mean, that's not what you're attracted to. To me, it's an obvious attempt to be [[01:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4479.52s)]
*  with power and money. It's like, look, a lot of women do that. Yeah. Maybe she's legitimately [[01:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4485.04s)]
*  attracted to it. I don't know. The whole thing is- Makes you uncomfortable. It's just, it's stunning. [[01:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4490.16s)]
*  It is stunning. Before we leave the topic of the Patriots, I remember asking you about this the [[01:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4498.08s)]
*  first time you came out. You were on one other time, a long time before. I think we only had audio at [[01:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4503.28s)]
*  the time. Do you hate or love Tom Brady? Love. Love. Okay. Yeah. So I may have spoken with you [[01:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4506.4800000000005s)]
*  when he went to the Bucks. Okay. I was mad at him. Maybe that's what happened. Yeah. I couldn't [[01:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4514.88s)]
*  remember. But he's the greatest of all time. Okay. There's no question in your mind. No question. [[01:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4518.8s)]
*  He's number one. Yes. And how is he doing as a sports commentator? Bad, awful, not good. Oh, why? [[01:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4521.4400000000005s)]
*  He just stinks at it. What do you mean? I mean, not everybody, he's the greatest quarterback. Not [[01:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4526.8s)]
*  everybody is born to be a great announcer. I just, I don't find him to be good at announcing. Now, [[01:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4530.8s)]
*  he's brand new. It's his first year. They gave him a gigantic contract, but he certainly didn't [[01:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4537.84s)]
*  come out of the gates like a natural. Didn't he have all sorts of training? I'm sure he did [[01:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4542.08s)]
*  for the amount they paid. But again, maybe anybody can eventually become a good announcer. I don't [[01:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4546.8s)]
*  know. It's not the easiest thing to do, but he just didn't come out of the gates. He's almost [[01:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4552.4800000000005s)]
*  to me too elevated. He's so great, like the way he talks. But no, I didn't think he did not come out [[01:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4556.64s)]
*  all guns firing. And again, it's his first year doing it. So maybe there should be some leeway, [[01:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4564.96s)]
*  but they paid him a ton of money. Oh yeah. I mean a ton. Almost $400 million. Yeah, it's crazy. [[01:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4570.320000000001s)]
*  Yeah. It's a big time deal. Okay. Shadour Sanders. Yes. So this is Dion Sanders' son. Yep. Dion [[01:16:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4574.88s)]
*  Sanders, such a big football star. Even I know that name. Yep. Who did Dion play for? In the [[01:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4582.48s)]
*  pros, he played for Falcons, Cowboys, and 49ers. Okay. And he is the one, I've quoted Dion Sanders [[01:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4588.16s)]
*  before because he had some great quote, which was something to the effect of, if you look good, [[01:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4594.0s)]
*  you play good. If you play good, they pay good. Yep. Which I love. That's very clever and cute. [[01:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4598.959999999999s)]
*  But his son, who was many expected to go like, well, you tell me where in the draft, what was [[01:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4604.08s)]
*  the expectation? I think earlier in the season, a lot of people were saying early first round, [[01:16:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4609.76s)]
*  top 10 pick. And then as they got close to the draft, it started sliding. And you heard maybe [[01:16:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4614.56s)]
*  end of the first round, second round is probably what people thought going into the draft. Because [[01:16:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4619.2s)]
*  he's a big college QB. Yes. Okay. And then the draft comes and walk us through how that unfolded [[01:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4623.04s)]
*  because he was like the story that night. Yes. So the draft comes, first round comes and goes, [[01:17:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4630.88s)]
*  he's not drafted. Not totally shocking. Mel Kuyper, who is the draft guy expert, he's ranting [[01:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4636.88s)]
*  and raving, he should go. And then round two comes, nothing. Round three comes, nothing. [[01:17:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4645.76s)]
*  So he slid, I believe, into the fourth round. How many rounds are there? There's I think six, [[01:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4650.8s)]
*  six or seven, six or seven. So now he's down in the bottom. Shocking, shocking. And players who, [[01:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4655.4400000000005s)]
*  I think, quarterbacks going, who I think anybody would say, well, Shador is better than him, [[01:17:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4661.68s)]
*  not drafted. And it became the story. And it kind of took on a life of its own with people all over [[01:17:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4666.24s)]
*  the internet chiming in, why isn't he getting drafted for various reasons. That was the story. [[01:17:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4671.6s)]
*  So I love Dion. He used to work for Barstool. He's one of my favorite guys I've ever met. [[01:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4678.64s)]
*  There were innuendos, it's race, it's this, it's that. To me, it was none of it. It was Shador [[01:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4684.0s)]
*  Sanders and the Sanders are one of the great publicity machines of all time. Like Dion's [[01:18:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4691.84s)]
*  heavily involved. Dion's saying, hey, I played in the NFL. We're picking what team we're going to. [[01:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4697.6s)]
*  He's going to be the starter. He's this, that. So there's a lot that comes, including you could [[01:18:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4703.12s)]
*  say a circus. When you draft Shador, you're putting a tent on the thing. For NFL teams, [[01:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4708.0s)]
*  there's nothing they hate more than distractions. They're like the most everyone's focused. We [[01:18:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4713.6s)]
*  don't need distractions. Having said that, if they think a guy can help them win, [[01:18:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4718.08s)]
*  you could be a murderer and they draft you. That's happened. Literally. That's all they care about. [[01:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4722.48s)]
*  But in evaluating, there's a fine line between is this guy the guy and can we win with Shador? [[01:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4727.6s)]
*  And is he the franchise? If teams thought that they would have picked them instantly. None of [[01:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4734.88s)]
*  the other stuff would have mattered. But he was kind of in a weird area where a lot of teams are [[01:18:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4739.28s)]
*  like this isn't, he's not going to be a 10 year star. He's not Tom Brady. And if he's not that, [[01:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4743.44s)]
*  do we want him fighting for a backup job? Do we want microphones in his face? Because that's a [[01:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4749.759999999999s)]
*  circus. The last thing you want. That's what I believe happens. So if you didn't think he was [[01:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4754.32s)]
*  the starter in a top five pick, do you want him in your locker room creating a circus environment? [[01:19:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4758.719999999999s)]
*  And he kind of got caught in the middle. And that's when he dropped all the way to Cleveland. [[01:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4766.4s)]
*  Now, if you're Cleveland or any team dropping him fourth, fifth, drafting him fourth, fifth round, [[01:19:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4770.639999999999s)]
*  you're like, you know what, enough. We're getting microphones. He's not who we think he is. [[01:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4774.96s)]
*  You just cut him. It's not the end of the world because you didn't waste the top draft pick. [[01:19:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4778.96s)]
*  If you take them early and it doesn't work, you're stuck with them really, because you can't [[01:19:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4783.04s)]
*  waste the draft pick. So I think that's what happened. All the other innuendo around it [[01:19:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4787.839999999999s)]
*  is garbage to me. Why is President Trump involved? He tweeted somebody should take him or what? [[01:19:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4792.32s)]
*  He must be friends with Dion. During the draft he tweeted. Yeah. Well, when he was slipping, [[01:19:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4797.2s)]
*  Trump loves talking football. You know, in a football team, he likes jumping in in these [[01:20:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4804.24s)]
*  discussions. I think sometimes Trump just can't handle having X in front of him. He's like, [[01:20:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4808.08s)]
*  how are they not? He's like a fan. He's president though. But I don't think he thought anything. [[01:20:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4813.76s)]
*  He's like, oh, I'm friends with Dion and I'm going to say he should be drafted. Is it inappropriate? [[01:20:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4819.12s)]
*  I like it. Like, do people think he was putting inappropriate pressure on teams as the president? [[01:20:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4825.599999999999s)]
*  No, I kind of like it. It depends what he's doing, but that's Trump. I mean, I thought it was funny. [[01:20:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4829.92s)]
*  The left tries to make a controversy out of everything Trump does. Okay, but back to this. [[01:20:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4835.84s)]
*  So Stephen A. Smith was on the show not long ago and he posted something that I know you disagreed [[01:20:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4840.4s)]
*  with, but explain it to me. So he posted, someone just texted me this message and they're absolutely [[01:20:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4844.4s)]
*  correct. Quote, this is a bad look for the NFL. This feels like Kaepernick level collusion. All [[01:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4848.48s)]
*  the hard work the NFL league office puts into eradicate these kinds of perceptions only to [[01:20:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4853.679999999999s)]
*  turn around and watch as the owners look like they're colluding, messing up everything. What [[01:20:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4857.839999999999s)]
*  has been done to Shador will outshine everything else in this draft. We'll never believe this is [[01:21:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4862.24s)]
*  just about talent evaluation again. And it, that does seem to be a reference to race. I mean, I [[01:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4866.5599999999995s)]
*  don't know why you'd bring in Kaepernick and what they're trying to do to me. I don't know why he [[01:21:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4872.879999999999s)]
*  didn't put the word racism. That's what it sounded like racism. That's why I responded. That's an [[01:21:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4877.52s)]
*  insane take to me. That just the owners and the NFL are arguably the most competitive group of like [[01:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4881.84s)]
*  billionaire successful people. They don't like each other. They want to win. They would never [[01:21:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4890.72s)]
*  collude. They never collude. If you, if they thought Shador could get them a super bowl, [[01:21:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4895.52s)]
*  they would do whatever. So to me, that just an absolutely insane take. It's just when you're [[01:21:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4901.120000000001s)]
*  drafting guys, not just strictly talent, you're looking at all the things that are surrounding [[01:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4906.16s)]
*  them. Who was the first draft pick this year? It was Cam Ward as a black quarterback. [[01:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4911.04s)]
*  And then I read that in the last three drafts, including this year, yeah, [[01:21:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4916.88s)]
*  black quarterback went number one overall. Yeah. So it's not, it has nothing to do with race at all. [[01:22:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4920.08s)]
*  Who thinks the NFL is racist? What's that? Who thinks the NFL is racist? [[01:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4926.72s)]
*  When he says the Kaepernick stuff, he's going back to take in knee and there were some teams [[01:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4930.32s)]
*  taking a knee, some not. I mean, Jerry Jones came out. So he's going back to that. And by the way, [[01:22:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4936.0s)]
*  there is similarities to me in the Kaepernick situation in which teams just viewed Kaepernick [[01:22:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4940.4s)]
*  and said, he's not good enough to have a circus farm. This is a distraction. Yeah. [[01:22:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4947.36s)]
*  So do you think Dion ultimately hurt his son by being such a big personality who they thought [[01:22:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4952.08s)]
*  they were going to have to deal with more than they wanted to? Strictly in where he got drafted, [[01:22:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4957.04s)]
*  would he have been drafted quicker if Dion, if it was Dion Jones, who was his dad? Absolutely. [[01:22:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4962.96s)]
*  If you ask Dion and you ask Shador, are you glad Dion's there? 100%. He probably wouldn't be [[01:22:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4970.320000000001s)]
*  getting drafted at all if it weren't for his dad. And he's this huge media, like, I mean, he's [[01:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4976.16s)]
*  partying, he's getting millions of dollars in endorsements and all this stuff. So it's a package [[01:23:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4980.24s)]
*  deal. But if you're just saying what teams have drafted him without, I mean, Dion before the [[01:23:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4984.400000000001s)]
*  draft is like, don't draft my kid if I don't like you because I'm not going to let him sign with [[01:23:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4989.28s)]
*  you. He's not the first one did that. The Mannings did that. Oh, really? Yeah. Eli Manning, they said [[01:23:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4992.8s)]
*  to, I believe it was the Colts. So like, if you draft him, he's not coming and they didn't draft [[01:23:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=4998.0s)]
*  them. So they bullied their way. Did one of them go to the Colts? No one went to the Colts? One [[01:23:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5002.08s)]
*  went to Denver. No, Giants. It was Eli went to the Giants instead of the Colts. The Colts had the [[01:23:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5005.5199999999995s)]
*  first pick. Did a Manning play for Denver? Yes, at the end of his career. When he had no army, [[01:23:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5010.16s)]
*  could throw five yards. You're right. Okay. No, a Manning played for the Colts. Peyton played his [[01:23:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5015.2s)]
*  entire career. Oh, there we go. Okay. You're right. So I was right. Was it the Colts? I don't know. [[01:23:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5020.4s)]
*  I forget now that you say it because Peyton played for the Colts. Wherever Eli, whoever had the first [[01:23:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5024.8s)]
*  pick, maybe it was San Diego. Oh, wait, they're telling me Peyton played for the Colts. Peyton [[01:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5029.44s)]
*  played for the Colts. Somebody had the first pick when Eli came out and Archie Manning, who played [[01:23:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5033.04s)]
*  in the league, did what Dion essentially did without as much pomp and circumstance, said if [[01:23:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5038.08s)]
*  you draft him, he's not going. And they didn't draft him. And John Elway has done it. So it's [[01:24:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5042.64s)]
*  not Dion's just was much more loud in this era of endorsements and stuff. It's the circus. And if [[01:24:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5047.76s)]
*  you don't think he's great, I probably won't want him on my team either because I don't want that to [[01:24:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5053.84s)]
*  be the focus of what everyone's talking about. Well, now we'll see. Right? Now the rubber will [[01:24:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5058.4800000000005s)]
*  meet the road. I think he's going to be great. So we'll see. Are the Browns any good? My friend's a [[01:24:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5062.56s)]
*  diehard Browns fan. He's always complaining about how bad they are. Worst franchise arguably in [[01:24:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5066.08s)]
*  sports. Oh, gosh. So he's not going to be happy about this. Well, who knows? Maybe he's the future. [[01:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5070.32s)]
*  But they have the weirdest QB room. I'm getting deep. But they have they have Deshaun Watson, [[01:24:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5074.799999999999s)]
*  the guy who had like nine thousand illegal massages. Oh, they paid him a ton of money. [[01:24:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5078.5599999999995s)]
*  They drafted another quarterback before. They have a wild QB room. Wild. Very Cleveland. I don't [[01:24:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5083.2s)]
*  know. That's fascinating. That's more for your next appearance. QB room with multiple massages. [[01:24:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5087.759999999999s)]

*  I just threw up a little in my mouth. What? Let me count the ways. There's nothing I like about her. [[01:29:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5380.72s)]
*  Do you know her? No, but she is a malignant narcissist who cannot get enough of herself [[01:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5385.92s)]
*  while she simultaneously plays the victim. My castle is too small. The queen is mean to me. [[01:29:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5391.52s)]
*  They won't let me call myself her royal highness anymore, but I'm gonna put it all over my [[01:29:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5397.92s)]
*  stationary and on the gifts that I give to my friends while she never stops whining. And at the [[01:30:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5401.76s)]
*  same time, I'm getting all worked up. I'm a founder. I'm over it. She's not important. She married [[01:30:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5407.120000000001s)]
*  for money. It's very clear. She bagged the elephant. She was thrilled. She became a quote princess. [[01:30:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5413.76s)]
*  Well, you can map. It was planned from the beginning. She denied being interested in [[01:30:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5418.32s)]
*  the royal family, which she totally was. I know someone who knows the ex-husband who said she had [[01:30:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5423.36s)]
*  a vision board with Prince Harry on it. Before they met? Yes. And she wants to pretend. That's [[01:30:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5427.84s)]
*  impressive. You got to admit that is impressive. She nailed it. Yeah. Because a lot of people [[01:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5432.88s)]
*  probably did that. It was like shooting fish in a barrel with all that self-help talk. He had, [[01:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5437.12s)]
*  he was no match for her. So I, as we unpack like an onion, some of the things I'm interested in, [[01:30:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5440.799999999999s)]
*  I actually liked the royal family. I think it's cool. So that's another thing. She killed the [[01:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5448.0s)]
*  queen. She did kill the queen. I don't, I agree with you. I can't have someone marry into the [[01:30:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5454.0s)]
*  royal family and be like, Whoa, as me of all these attention or whatever you're getting from me. [[01:31:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5461.68s)]
*  No kidding. It's the royal family. I can't believe I'm not getting paid. Yeah. All this stuff. And [[01:31:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5468.48s)]
*  then they didn't, they renounced their royalty, but they still want the royalty. So it is [[01:31:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5472.72s)]
*  hypocritical to get into that situation and then want nothing to do with it. But you do want [[01:31:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5477.12s)]
*  anything to do with it. I don't have as strong a feelings as you do for her. I don't care for her. [[01:31:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5481.2s)]
*  I wouldn't put her in a hate category of mine. I don't like her. I didn't see that interview, [[01:31:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5487.44s)]
*  but yeah, I I'm a Royals guy. So I liked the Royal. I think it's kind of cool. The history, [[01:31:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5493.84s)]
*  the pageantry, and she'll just come in and kind of blow it up and then cry. It's like, Whoa, [[01:31:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5498.72s)]
*  and she's a bully. I mean, the reports were uniformly from inside the castle that all the [[01:31:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5503.599999999999s)]
*  young women in particular who work for her quit in tears. She so wore them down. It was so nasty. [[01:31:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5508.4s)]
*  Then when she started her own company, similar reports coming out from Montecito about how [[01:31:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5513.76s)]
*  knowing can work for her. She's a nightmare behind the scenes and not toward the betterment [[01:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5518.16s)]
*  of her staff, just because she's an insecure person who takes it out on other people. What [[01:32:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5522.32s)]
*  was up with the no makeup? That had to be an intentional move. That's another thing. Maureen [[01:32:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5526.88s)]
*  was saying this on her Maureen Callahan has a new podcast. We're part of our network and the [[01:32:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5530.0s)]
*  makeup lady. Yeah. And exactly right. And it's bullshit. So first of all, she had the hair [[01:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5533.68s)]
*  blown out. It was perfect. I do not believe that she was makeup free there. She didn't have eye [[01:32:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5537.84s)]
*  makeup on, which is a different thing. But that's her being relatable, Dave. Yeah, right. Relatable. [[01:32:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5542.0s)]
*  The intentional relatable. Yeah. So here she is talking about the joy. She don't like your top [[01:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5546.64s)]
*  10 hate list. Oh yeah. She's top five. The joy of working hard. I'm sure she's really toiling away. [[01:32:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5553.36s)]
*  Take a listen. But to the world, it's just what has she been doing? Does she work? As opposed to, [[01:32:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5562.24s)]
*  oh my gosh, I work so hard and I appreciate what hard work looks like. I like working hard. [[01:32:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5569.759999999999s)]
*  And I'm still working hard, right? The moment that everything sells out, it doesn't mean that [[01:32:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5579.5199999999995s)]
*  we're done. It means we're working on replenishment and what are the next [[01:33:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5583.36s)]
*  SKUs and what's the next tranche of products and what's the timing on that and writing the [[01:33:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5586.4s)]
*  newsletters and writing the social media captions and making sure that all that feels in line and [[01:33:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5589.679999999999s)]
*  what's the cadence of it and what's the photography that we want to do and what do I want to wear for [[01:33:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5593.36s)]
*  those shoots while also editing all the time coded notes for season two of The Other Lady [[01:33:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5597.44s)]
*  and then being in edits for the podcast and making a smile and being a mom and a wife and a friend. [[01:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5603.2s)]
*  Those are all jobs. I mean, I love being that busy, but I do think it's really interesting [[01:33:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5611.04s)]
*  when people have no sense of what goes into the thing. And then when the thing seems like... [[01:33:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5617.12s)]
*  It's like she's going through ferns almost the way she's hosting it. [[01:33:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5621.36s)]
*  The thing's not done. The finish line was really the starting line. [[01:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5624.5599999999995s)]
*  Okay, we get it. Yes, go. [[01:33:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5629.28s)]
*  That would infuriate me as someone who's trying to start a business struggling because you can't [[01:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5633.92s)]
*  fail. If you're selling... I don't know what she's selling, candles. I don't know what she's selling. [[01:33:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5639.44s)]
*  Jam. [[01:34:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5643.759999999999s)]
*  Jam. You're in the royal family. So to this head start that you have and then complain about [[01:34:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5644.48s)]
*  working hard, it's like you're in the royal family. So to complain about, oh, the business... [[01:34:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5651.28s)]
*  You don't have to... If you don't want to show up, if you don't want to do the schedule, [[01:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5656.5599999999995s)]
*  you don't have to do anything you don't want to do. You're living in a fantasy, literally, [[01:34:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5659.36s)]
*  like a fantasy tale of... But the other, the host... [[01:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5662.48s)]
*  What's happening with her? [[01:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5666.96s)]
*  If you actually didn't... If people didn't know who is who, I think people would be focusing on [[01:34:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5668.0s)]
*  the host and the expression. Yeah, it was between two ferns. So I don't know. I don't hate her as [[01:34:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5673.68s)]
*  much as you, but... It's really... It's like a love to hate situation. I don't have actual hatred for [[01:34:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5680.48s)]
*  her. I have that for very few people. It's a small list, but she's not on it. But I just can't stand [[01:34:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5685.52s)]
*  her. I just think she's such a phony. I love to make fun of her because she continues to give me [[01:34:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5690.72s)]
*  so much material. She comes across as a phony in that. I've got to show you one more on that. [[01:34:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5695.12s)]
*  Okay. Look, this is a short one. Sot29. Look at this ridiculousness. [[01:34:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5699.599999999999s)]
*  Your close friends and family, so many of them call you M and Harry H. [[01:35:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5704.72s)]
*  Yes. How did that start? And tell me about that. [[01:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5711.12s)]
*  Probably at the beginning of us dating when everything was in code. [[01:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5715.12s)]
*  Code, yeah. Right. People didn't know we were dating for... [[01:35:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5720.64s)]
*  Yeah, she's... Talk about memory lane. [[01:35:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5723.04s)]
*  So long ago. It'll be our seven-year wedding anniversary soon. I couldn't tell anyone how [[01:35:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5725.92s)]
*  I was dating and he was keeping... So I think we were just on a letter basis. And then it stuck. [[01:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5731.36s)]
*  It stuck. It stuck. [[01:35:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5738.72s)]
*  It was their code. Their super stealthy code. M and H. When I call Doug, bug. [[01:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5741.92s)]
*  Yeah. It's ridiculous. That's like choosing your alias as a famous person and it's John Smith. [[01:35:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5751.52s)]
*  Will that podcast have crazy numbers because she's on it? Does she move the needle like that? [[01:35:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5757.68s)]
*  I have no idea. But if it does, it's going to be at least two-thirds hate listeners like me. [[01:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5762.4s)]
*  Yeah. I mean, I actually, again, I think it'll be overshadowed by the interviewer who looks like [[01:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5767.04s)]
*  on outer space. Yes. And so bizarre with the weird blush. [[01:36:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5773.52s)]
*  Yeah. And the makeup to no makeup. [[01:36:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5776.88s)]
*  So speaking of podcast success, do you have any advice for me? You've grown this huge... [[01:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5778.8s)]
*  Yours is killing it, right? Well, I only have two in the MK Podcast [[01:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5782.400000000001s)]
*  Network so far. Oh, you're talking adding. [[01:36:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5785.92s)]
*  Yeah. Adding like a network. You have a network at Barstool. [[01:36:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5788.400000000001s)]
*  Well, are you focused on news? Yes. News, culture, everything related to news. [[01:36:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5793.360000000001s)]
*  Yeah. I don't know. Not sports. [[01:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5800.56s)]
*  We've always just looked for different things. Try to find something, [[01:36:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5803.76s)]
*  talented people and find things that I haven't seen necessarily before. So like Call Her Daddy, [[01:36:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5808.24s)]
*  which I was surprised I don't see the big signs around here. [[01:36:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5814.8s)]
*  Yeah. You found that. She went on to become extremely... [[01:36:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5817.28s)]
*  And I hadn't seen anything like that. It wasn't my cup of tea, but it was like, oh, [[01:37:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5820.24s)]
*  this is different. And we've been very successful for that. But it's trying to get out of, I guess, [[01:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5823.44s)]
*  a network sense. And I'm sure it would be similar with you. If I see something and it catches me [[01:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5828.32s)]
*  for more than a minute or two, it's like, I'm interested in this. That's a good start. [[01:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5833.84s)]
*  We've certainly been wrong a lot. It's a band label for us. Kind of like a band label, [[01:37:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5837.84s)]
*  sign a bunch of little bands, hopefully one or two hit, and that kind of is the model. [[01:37:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5842.32s)]
*  And how long do you wait until you cut bait or declare them as successful? [[01:37:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5846.8s)]
*  We sign them for contracts. So it's generally like two to three years. So like a band label. [[01:37:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5851.04s)]
*  And not different from a band label. Once they become successful, they're very difficult to [[01:37:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5855.76s)]
*  deal with. Then they want the money, they see what's going on. And so the talent business [[01:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5860.0s)]
*  stinks. Because once the talent becomes big, they don't need you anymore and they may be [[01:37:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5865.92s)]
*  under contract. But you got to, they generally, if we can't resign them, they leave. And we built [[01:37:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5870.4s)]
*  a lot of very rich superstars in this digital age from Alex Cooper, Pat McAfee, a lot of people [[01:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5876.8s)]
*  make a lot of money. And then we just got to refill the pipeline and find the next and it never ends. [[01:38:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5882.8s)]
*  And that sucks. I feel like, you know, I have good people. I have faith in them. We have a good [[01:38:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5887.12s)]
*  relationship, but famous last words, I take your point. So, I mean, your company now is huge, [[01:38:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5891.84s)]
*  right? I read that in like 2002, you were filing for bankruptcy. And now you're talking about the [[01:38:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5897.360000000001s)]
*  Trump terrorist costing you like $20 million. That's just what it cost you. So you're obviously [[01:38:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5903.28s)]
*  hugely successful. Yeah, we've done well. That bankruptcy thing, by the way, was a New York [[01:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5908.24s)]
*  Times hit piece. I did, but it was like my dad told me in college and I hate the New York Times. [[01:38:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5912.4800000000005s)]
*  Anyhow, that wasn't a business thing. So yeah, we sold Barstool in 2016, 15% of it for about [[01:38:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5916.88s)]
*  12 million was the valuation. Then we sold it again for 600 million was the valuation. And then I got [[01:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5925.92s)]
*  it back for a dollar. So now I have the whole thing again. That was so crazy. Yeah. So it's been a [[01:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5931.6s)]
*  wild ride. So what like, now that you have all this money, do you live differently? Are you different? [[01:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5936.08s)]
*  I don't think I'm different. I certainly live differently. Things that I've always been [[01:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5941.84s)]
*  interested in, like horse racing, Kentucky Derbies this weekend. I love horses. Love. So I would go [[01:39:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5945.76s)]
*  to the track growing up. And now instead of being in the bleacher section or with the riff-raff bet [[01:39:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5951.360000000001s)]
*  in two bucks, I can afford to own the horses. So things like that have changed, but it's still [[01:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5957.52s)]
*  my core interests. I don't think I've changed. I guess, I mean, a positive thing about Barstool, [[01:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5962.400000000001s)]
*  a lot of the people who started with me are still there. So, you know, that's your ride or dies. [[01:39:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5968.88s)]
*  Yeah, our rider dies or we just treat our employees like well. And I don't think anybody [[01:39:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5973.36s)]
*  would ever say about me. They may be like, he's a jerk or he's blunt, but nobody would be like, [[01:39:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5979.2s)]
*  he's dishonest. I'm pretty straight in all my dealings with people. And that's helped get us, [[01:39:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5983.5199999999995s)]
*  I mean, we've been around now over 20 years, so that's helped. Well, I find it entertaining. I go [[01:39:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5987.28s)]
*  over there not really for sports, but when commentary comes into the news world, political, [[01:39:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5992.16s)]
*  I love it. I love how viral I mean, I saw, I try not to because whatever you get in politics, [[01:39:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=5996.16s)]
*  people and both the right and left. If I like, I criticized Trump the other day because his line [[01:40:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6003.04s)]
*  about the stock market is not his stock. It is like you have affected the stock market because [[01:40:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6008.56s)]
*  of tariffs. End of story. It's it, you can't say it's not like you can't blame that on Biden. [[01:40:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6014.64s)]
*  It's yours. You're by the tariffs. It's yours. And if I say that suddenly, all the people like me on [[01:40:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6021.2s)]
*  the right hate me. They're like, oh yeah. But it's like, I have to call it how I see it. You're saying [[01:40:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6026.88s)]
*  how you actually feel, which is that's, that's the name of this game. That's for sure. By the [[01:40:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6030.88s)]
*  way, my team tells me that this YouTube show for this Jamie lady, this squeaky voiced makeup lady [[01:40:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6035.04s)]
*  is there at 251,000 views after three days, which is terrible. Yeah. Absolutely terrible for having [[01:40:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LD0X1wrKrwY&t=6040.32s)]
