# ‘It’s not just scary, it’s wrong’ Romney book reveals how he sees decay of GOP
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 26, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA)
*  Along with everything else going on today, today is also the first full day with [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=0.0s)]
*  MAGA Republican Mike Johnson as the United States Speaker of the House. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=5.36s)]
*  He only became speaker in the first place because a small group of House Republicans [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=8.8s)]
*  who previously expressed their reservations about installing, essentially an insurrectionist, [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=12.88s)]
*  a second line in the presidency, appeared to get over those reservations in a matter of days. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=17.12s)]
*  Do you remember earlier this month, Colorado Republican Ken Buck was everywhere talking to [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  saying he couldn't support Steve Scalise or Jim Gordon from Speaker because they would not give [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=26.72s)]
*  him a straight answer on whether or not they believed the 2020 election was stolen. Pretty [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=30.56s)]
*  simple question. But Ken Buck voted for Mike Johnson, one of the key architects of Trump's [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=34.4s)]
*  attempted coup. In fact, every Republican in the House supported Johnson for Speaker. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=39.2s)]
*  And that's been the consistent story day after day, week after week, month after month, year [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=44.239999999999995s)]
*  after year in the Trump era. Depressing, defeated cowardice of so-called principal conservatives [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=48.16s)]
*  as the Republican Party slips further and further into its dark authoritarian [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=53.28s)]
*  hovel. One of the only elected Republicans in Washington who's managed to defy that trend and [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=57.44s)]
*  remain relatively consistent in their public critiques of Trump and the MAGA movement is, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=62.8s)]
*  of course, Utah Senator Mitt Romney. On substance, Romney is a conservative. He's not, he hasn't [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=67.04s)]
*  gone over to being a dem or a lib. And he always has been. He's a conservative Republican. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=72.8s)]
*  On questions of democracy in Donald Trump, he is squarely in the camp of preserving America's [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=77.6s)]
*  Constitution against its foes. He voted for both impeachments of Donald Trump. He was the only [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=81.84s)]
*  Republican in the Senate to support the first one. Last month, Romney announced he will not [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=87.04s)]
*  run for reelection in Utah. But he did agree to sit down for a new incredibly confessional book [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=92.4s)]
*  with McKay Coppens, who got unprecedented access to one of, I think, the most interesting figures [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=98.64s)]
*  in 21st century American politics. I'm joined now by McKay Coppens, staff writer at The Atlantic, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=103.68s)]
*  author of Romney, a Reckoning, which is out now. Now, viewers of the program have probably seen [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=108.56s)]
*  you and seen excerpts of the book, but I want to just take a moment to plug the book, which is [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=112.64s)]
*  truly excellent. And people should read because it's so well done and so well written. And I've [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=116.32000000000001s)]
*  been reading it and I've got to read a lot of stuff at work. And I really actually like enjoy [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=120.16s)]
*  reading it. So congratulations on that. Thank you. Thank you. I want to start on this, the Ken Buck [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=123.44s)]
*  question, the kind of, I think Romney views this through the lens of his faith. Yes. And, you know, [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=127.52000000000001s)]
*  he's a man of faith, Mormon, you're a man of faith. All of this in the sort of sense of a grander test [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=133.92000000000002s)]
*  of virtue. Like, and I relate to it too, as a Catholic, like a man for all seasons, that like [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=140.96s)]
*  the devil is out there to tempt you. Yeah. And he's out there to tell you all this can be yours. You [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=147.36s)]
*  just compromise. And watching everyone compromise has driven him a little nuts. It's made him very [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=152.16s)]
*  angry, but it's also sort of, I think, what comes across in the book is that that story he's telling [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=158.96s)]
*  himself about his own ethical nature is key to how he has navigated all this. No question. I mean, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=163.36s)]
*  the thing when he talks about it in public, he talks about principle and integrity. I think when [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=168.64000000000001s)]
*  there's also a theological part of this where he could talk about the light of Christ or whatever [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=173.68s)]
*  in Mormon theology, but essentially he sees this moment as a testing moment, right? This is a moment [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=178.8s)]
*  when he's seen one member of his party after another, in his view, sell out their principles, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=187.6s)]
*  sell out their beliefs and ideals to win reelection. And they tell him in private, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=194.32s)]
*  we agree with you, but we can't say it in public. And he really does, he actually gets this from his [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=199.84s)]
*  dad in a way, I think, that he frames things in a kind of right versus wrong, good versus evil [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=204.88s)]
*  template. And he sees what's happening in the Republican Party and what's happening to the [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=212.48s)]
*  country as alarming and frightening and bad, wrong. It's not just scary, it's wrong. And he wants to [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=216.8s)]
*  be remembered as somebody who's standing up against it. Yeah, you mentioned George Romney. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=224.72s)]
*  George Romney is a fascinating figure for a million different reasons. I could write a whole book. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=229.12s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he really is a really interesting guy. Of course, he was the governor of Michigan. He had [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=233.36s)]
*  run one of the big three auto companies where he was CEO. He was also, he was the head of HUD [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=237.52s)]
*  during racial integration, where he was actually an incredibly important Republican voice for [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=242.16s)]
*  desegregation and housing. You write about this in 64, where he played a similar role in the party [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=246.96s)]
*  back then, that he went to the RNC to try to warn against Goldwater. That's right. The warning went [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=252.4s)]
*  unheeded. A couple nights later, the delegates enthusiastically lined up to support Goldwater, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=259.36s)]
*  who declared victory by needling his do-gooding detractors. Extremism in the defense of liberty [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=263.28s)]
*  is no vice, he said in his speech. When the convention hall erupted in applause, George [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=267.84s)]
*  remained quietly seated. His teenage son, who traveled within San Francisco, was sure one thing. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=271.84s)]
*  If thousands of people were cheering and dad was standing alone, I knew he was right and they were [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=276.0s)]
*  wrong. Again, he sees this as a moment of a test of integrity of character. His dad standing a thwart [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=279.67999999999995s)]
*  history, yelling stop, right? Which is funny to borrow that conservative terminology, because [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=287.76s)]
*  actually, Mitt Romney, I think, inherited from this experience a distrust, a suspicion of [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=292.24s)]
*  movement conservatism. It always existed outside of it, whether it was in the 1960s with the rise [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=298.8s)]
*  of the radical right of the Goldwater Republicans, or right now with the rise of the pro-Trump [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=305.28000000000003s)]
*  Magna Republicans. He is, like you said, he's a conservative, but when it manifests in this [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=311.76s)]
*  right-wing populist movement, he's repelled by it, and he's afraid of it in some ways. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=316.96s)]
*  I mean, Mitt Romney is repelled at a cellular level by populism of any kind. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=325.03999999999996s)]
*  That's part of what's happening, too. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=331.12s)]
*  He has this riff, he said it a hundred times to me, that for every question there's a populist [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=334.71999999999997s)]
*  answer that is popular and wrong. He is, he's not a populist figure, but there's something specific [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=340.0s)]
*  about right-wing populism, and especially in this Trump era. I think he sees in the rise of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=348.16s)]
*  Donald Trump an echo of what his dad went through. Yeah, and yet he made his pact with it. He made [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=353.92s)]
*  his own pact with the devil in 2012, and of course, he did the event with Trump quite famously. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=360.08s)]
*  And he had to court that right-wing. He had advisors who taught him, you need to start [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=365.04s)]
*  reading the National Review. You have to start paying attention to what Fox News says. You need [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=369.28s)]
*  to learn the language of the right so you could try to win them over. I remember him ripping Rick [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=372.96s)]
*  Perry's face off in a debate for being soft on immigrants, attacking him from his right. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=378.32s)]
*  The Mike Johnson scenario and the 21 days of, I mean, I saw Romney today saying that, you know, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=383.76s)]
*  maybe you should have a speaker who has some experience, which I think is a pretty good idea. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=389.52s)]
*  It seems to me like just a perfect little microcosm, right, of how this all plays out. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  Do you come away, having covered this topic for as long as you haven't written this book, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=400.08s)]
*  with some clearer vision for a proper intervention other than like virtue, backbone, principle, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=407.12s)]
*  all these things that Mitt Romney talks about? Or maybe that's it. Maybe it's just character. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=414.15999999999997s)]
*  I think it's character, but there is something else. You know, Mitt Romney said to me, [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=418.4s)]
*  in one of our last interviews, he was making this point that like part of what changed for [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=423.28s)]
*  Mitt Romney in these last several years is he stopped thinking about trying to become president [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=428.4s)]
*  and started thinking about his legacy, how he would be remembered, what his obituary would be. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=432.88s)]
*  And he said he thinks that if there was some way to get other Republicans to think less about [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=438.23999999999995s)]
*  the immediate news cycle or the next election and more about what their grandchildren are [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=445.44s)]
*  going to remember about them, that their calculation would start to change. And that's [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=450.56s)]
*  not just like a righteous idea. It's also, you know, there's some vanity involved. All politicians [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=454.88s)]
*  want to be in the history books. I was just about to say, he comes across, he has a high degree of [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=462.08s)]
*  moral vanity. And one of the things that comes across as someone who also has a fair amount of [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=466.72s)]
*  moral vanity is that it's a very salutary thing to have. Like in the end, right, even if it's like [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=471.04s)]
*  you have some conception of yourself as being a good person and not wanting to fail a test, [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=476.96s)]
*  and there's some vanity that attends to that, it actually forces you maybe to do the right thing. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  McKay Coppins, check out Romney, A Reckoning, wherever you get your books. Thanks a lot. We'll [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=485.76s)]
*  be right back. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=490.32s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RU6WMDJ5PgA&t=506.96s)]
