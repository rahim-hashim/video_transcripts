# 'Name your price': Trump TikTok flip-flop shows he’s ‘for sale’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U)
*  But as you watch this legislation voted in today and the debate about what's going to happen to it, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=0.0s)]
*  it also highlights an essential question about how democracy functions, how legislation is made, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=6.0s)]
*  and fundamentally what we want our political representatives to do. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=12.0s)]
*  Essentially, we want them to evaluate arguments and assess costs and benefits, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=16.0s)]
*  listen to different interests and constituents, [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=20.0s)]
*  and ultimately make good faith judgments about what they think is best for the country [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=23.0s)]
*  and for the people they represent. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=27.0s)]
*  What we don't want our representatives doing is what happens too much in Washington, frankly, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=29.0s)]
*  which is siding with the folks who write the biggest checks. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=35.0s)]
*  And that is particularly true if the politician in question is in desperate financial straits [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=38.0s)]
*  and willing to do anything, including selling off their own political platform [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=43.0s)]
*  to any person willing to pony up the most cash. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=47.0s)]
*  Which brings us to the most prominent Republican opponent of today's bill, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=51.0s)]
*  one Donald Trump. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=55.0s)]
*  Now, the ex-president, we should note, is a bit of a late convert to the pro-TikTok cause. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=56.0s)]
*  Here he is as president four years ago threatening to ban the app outright. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=61.0s)]
*  We're looking at TikTok. We may be banning TikTok. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=67.0s)]
*  We may be doing some other things or a couple of options, but a lot of things are happening. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=70.0s)]
*  So we'll see what happens. But we are looking at a lot of alternatives with respect to TikTok. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=75.0s)]
*  In fact, Trump tried to go through with that ban, although ultimately it fell apart. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=82.0s)]
*  It was thrown out by the courts. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=86.0s)]
*  But here he is two days ago in the run up to this vote, two days ago on CNBC announcing, opposing a ban. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=88.0s)]
*  Frankly, there are a lot of people on TikTok that love it. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=97.0s)]
*  There are a lot of young kids on TikTok who will go crazy without it. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=100.0s)]
*  There are a lot of users. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=105.0s)]
*  There's a lot of good and there's a lot of bad with TikTok. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=108.0s)]
*  But the thing I don't like is that without TikTok, you can make Facebook bigger. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=111.0s)]
*  And I consider Facebook to be an enemy of the people. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=116.0s)]
*  Right. You may remember Facebook banned him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=120.0s)]
*  Trump has a vendetta against Mark Zuckerberg, who he calls Zucker Schmuck. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=123.0s)]
*  So the TikTok flip flop that you just saw from Trump, it didn't come out of nowhere. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=128.0s)]
*  It wasn't like he was sitting there like, oh, let's look at the frozen cons articles. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=132.0s)]
*  Someone get this all together to me. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=136.0s)]
*  No, get this. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=138.0s)]
*  It was just like two weeks ago when this vote was scheduled, everyone knew it was going to happen, that a Republican mega donor, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=139.0s)]
*  that guy named Jeff Yass, made the pilgrimage down to Mar-a-Lago to kiss Trump's ring. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=145.0s)]
*  And it was particularly notable because Yass has previously been something of a Trump skeptic. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=152.0s)]
*  It's also notable because Yass co-founded a trading firm that owns 15 percent of TikTok's parent company [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=157.0s)]
*  and reportedly has a personal stake in the company worth tens of billions of dollars. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=164.0s)]
*  Jeff Yass, who's an enormous Republican donor, the leading donor in 2024 so far, has a lot riding on this decision. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=169.0s)]
*  OK. Well, you don't have to be a genius to put two and two together here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=176.0s)]
*  Yass visits, Trump announces he now poses the ban. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=180.0s)]
*  In fact, even Steve Bannon figured it out. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=183.0s)]
*  Bannon figured it out, taking to a fringe right-wing social platform to share an article about Trump's flip-flop with a caption, [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=186.0s)]
*  quote, simply, Yass coin. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=192.0s)]
*  And thanks to Mitch McConnell and the John Roberts Supreme Court, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=195.0s)]
*  we effectively have no real actual meaningful campaign finance regulations left in this country, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=198.0s)]
*  which means that someone like Jeff Yass, again, who has like billions of dollars on the line, [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=203.0s)]
*  can write a billion dollar check to Donald Trump's super PAC if he's so inclined. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=209.0s)]
*  Might get good return on that investment. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=214.0s)]
*  So it should come as no surprise that the ex-president left that meeting with Yass with a newfound appreciation for TikTok. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=216.0s)]
*  And here's the thing, ladies and gentlemen, this is not a one-off. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=223.0s)]
*  I am telling you right now, this is now the way policy is going to get formed in this campaign and in a possible second Trump term, [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=227.0s)]
*  especially when the man is in acute financial distress and does not have the liquidity [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=234.0s)]
*  to pony up the $600 million he owes in legal penalties. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=241.0s)]
*  He is also way behind in fundraising partly because he and his operation have already cannibalized huge amounts of small dollar donations [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=245.0s)]
*  already in order to pay off tens of millions of dollars in legal fees. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=254.0s)]
*  Legal fees, I should add, that aren't going anywhere and are probably going to get worse. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=259.0s)]
*  A core part of Trump's appeal back in 2016 was this lie, it was a schtick, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=264.0s)]
*  that his personal wealth, I'm a big billionaire, would allow him to self-fund his campaign and make him immune to outside influence. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=269.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton's campaign is funded by Wall Street and hedge fund managers. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=276.0s)]
*  My campaign is powered by my money. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=283.0s)]
*  I'm self-funding, so I'm not controlled by all these people that control Cruz, that control Hillary, crooked, crooked, crooked Hillary. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=289.0s)]
*  I have tens and tens of millions of dollars, nobody else does. I put my own money into this. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=298.0s)]
*  Okay, that was always a lie. He raised huge sums of money from donors in that campaign. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=306.0s)]
*  But right now he is more beholden to donors and the donor class than ever before. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=312.0s)]
*  He owes hundreds of millions of dollars. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=317.0s)]
*  The small donations that they've been just cranking, right, are showing signs of running dry. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=320.0s)]
*  There's only so many $10 donations you can get out of people. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=326.0s)]
*  And so, name your price, billionaires. Donald Trump's political positions are for sale. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=330.0s)]
*  We've seen it with TikTok and his flip-flopping on cutting things like Medicare and Social Security, [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=336.0s)]
*  another unpopular position he once opposed but now seems open to because, again, it is what extremely wealthy donors want to see. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=341.0s)]
*  The ex-president is strapped for cash and the Republican platform and America's governing agenda, perhaps, is up for auction to the highest bidder. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CAe8rhyQ53U&t=349.0s)]
