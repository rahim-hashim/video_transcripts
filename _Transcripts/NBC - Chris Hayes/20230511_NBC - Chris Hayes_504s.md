# Hayes on Trump town hall: A seditious candidate can't be debated, only defeated
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Last night, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=0.0s)]
*  let's talk about last night because the last night at this time, [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=3.0s)]
*  the man that led the insurrection against our democracy was spewing vile nonsense on another network. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=5.8s)]
*  Of course, I was here hosting this very television show, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=11.0s)]
*  hopefully with many of you watching. I did not see the whole thing play out live. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=14.8s)]
*  But I've seen enough. I've seen enough to have had the same [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=19.3s)]
*  visceral reaction as many others, that it was disgraceful, despicable, gross, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=23.6s)]
*  if you had that reaction too, I'll just say I think that's the correct response. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=30.2s)]
*  I don't think you really need to second guess it. You should just trust your gut on that one. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=35.9s)]
*  That said, it's not the end of the story because there's a useful question to come out of that feeling, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=40.6s)]
*  the bad feeling, which is why? Why was that town hall so bad? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=46.3s)]
*  What made it so awful? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=51.5s)]
*  Now one possibility a lot of people suggest is it because it helped Donald Trump. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=54.5s)]
*  A national cable news network gave him over an hour of airtime to say pretty much whatever he wanted, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=59.300000000000004s)]
*  and that provided Trump the front runner for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination with a lot of attention. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=64.2s)]
*  And attention for Donald Trump is a kind of power. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=70.9s)]
*  And that is likely true, this argument, within the context of the Republican primary and Republican primary voters. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=74.3s)]
*  I think the town hall last night probably does help the ex-president in his quest to secure the Republican nomination. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=80.4s)]
*  And of course, that in and of itself is very dangerous because whoever becomes a Republican nominee [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=87.6s)]
*  or the nominee of either of the two major parties in securing that nomination becomes a coin flip away from becoming the next president of the United States. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=93.0s)]
*  Even if, for example, that person attempted to put an end to free and fair elections in this country once and for all. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=103.8s)]
*  Now another reason why last night's spectacle was so bad wasn't what the ex-president said, but the crowd in that room. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=111.2s)]
*  CNN made the choice to pack the town hall in Manchester, New Hampshire with an unruly audience of Trump supporters. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=120.2s)]
*  And so what Americans saw was his display of our fellow citizens, our people, we share the country with them, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=126.0s)]
*  cheering and laughing as Trump peddled lies and mocked the woman he was just found liable for sexually abusing and defaming, by the way, completely predictable. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=133.3s)]
*  The network absolutely knew that would happen when they invited in that audience. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=144.1s)]
*  And that spectacle itself was just repugnant. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=148.1s)]
*  Now, we have seen a lot of reaction to the town hall over the last 25 hours, running the gamut from damning to defensive. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=152.5s)]
*  I will level with you here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=158.9s)]
*  I think most of the people defending the event are doing so disingenuously or because it's their job to do so or otherwise in their own interest. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=161.3s)]
*  Although there is one argument, I think, defending it that that is not crazy at all. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=171.9s)]
*  We've heard a wide range of anti-Trump folks suggesting that that hour plus was an effective reminder for America of who the guy is, what this man is like, and what a second Trump term would bring. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=176.3s)]
*  And advisor President Biden described it as, quote, weeks worth of damning content in one hour. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=189.1s)]
*  It was quite efficient. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=193.9s)]
*  And Biden himself tweeted along with the fundraising link, quote, it's simple, folks. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=195.29999999999998s)]
*  Do you want four more years of that? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=199.0s)]
*  If you don't pitch into our campaign. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=200.79999999999998s)]
*  Now, you know, my position on this Donald Trump is toxic and he is unpopular. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=203.9s)]
*  A recent poll found his favorability rating had collapsed down to just 25 percent. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=208.0s)]
*  His obsession with the 2020 election is particularly alienating. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=212.5s)]
*  The vast majority of voters do not agree with him. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=217.6s)]
*  The election was stolen, although you couldn't tell from who was in that room. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  In fact, and this is key, nearly 40 percent of Republican and Republican leaning independents disagree with them. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=224.0s)]
*  They think correctly that Joe Biden won fair and square in 2020. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=230.29999999999998s)]
*  And when the ex-president acts like an utter sociopath, as he did last night, I think it does not help him win over the swing voters. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=235.7s)]
*  He will need to win the presidency should he secure the nomination. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=244.9s)]
*  As the Senate minority whip Republican John Thune put it, quote, it looks like a lot of Democratic campaign ads being written last night. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=250.8s)]
*  So that's an argument in defense that I don't think is disingenuous. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  I don't think it's in bad faith. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=261.3s)]
*  I don't think it's people who are just doing it because they have to. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=262.3s)]
*  You could argue plausibly that showing America what it would be getting is bad for Trump's political prospects and therefore a good thing for the country. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=265.40000000000003s)]
*  But I think that's wrong for a core reason. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=275.1s)]
*  It's more fundamental than anything having to do with who it helps politically. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=278.1s)]
*  The core reason last night was bad is the simple, undeniable truth that Donald Trump attempted to end American democracy. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=283.2s)]
*  That man, he tried to destroy the foundational conceit of this country. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=292.40000000000003s)]
*  It's the one we all celebrate, right? [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=297.3s)]
*  Since the revolution of 1776, that the government is chosen by the people, that we decide who rules over us, that we are not ruled by a king nor a strong man. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=299.1s)]
*  That's kind of the whole thing, right? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=311.3s)]
*  That's the soul of the American experiment. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=314.2s)]
*  Not only did he try to snuff that out, he failed in doing so, but wants to finish the job. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=317.6s)]
*  I cannot stress this strongly enough. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=327.0s)]
*  You did not need to watch the town hall last night to know that, despite what people may say about making news. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=329.0s)]
*  His 2024 campaign, to those of us who have been observing above all else, is a campaign to finish what he started on January 6th to complete the sacking of the Capitol. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=335.8s)]
*  He will do that by any means necessary. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=347.5s)]
*  No one should have any illusions about this. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=351.6s)]
*  Donald Trump wants to end American elections. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=354.9s)]
*  The unifying principle of his campaign is that he and his most fervent supporters should rule over this nation, no matter how outnumbered they are. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=359.5s)]
*  That's it. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=370.2s)]
*  That's the foundational platform. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=371.0s)]
*  He is not actually running for a second term. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=375.1s)]
*  He is running for a forever term. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=377.3s)]
*  As we saw on display in the audience last night, represented there, there are tens of millions of our fellow citizens. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=382.2s)]
*  In the grip of, for lack of a better description, a kind of psychosis and fealty to that vision. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=389.0s)]
*  That vision, which is that this minority of Americans should rule over everyone else through the instrument of Donald Trump, that vision is an existential threat to the Union and to American democracy. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=394.8s)]
*  Journalists who are protected by those constitutional principles who can only exist in a liberal democracy, a constitutional republic with the First Amendment, have a responsibility to preserve those foundational freedoms. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=406.9s)]
*  Donald Trump is simply, unquestionably, an enemy of that. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=420.29999999999995s)]
*  He is a candidate of disunion and of tyranny and insurrection. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=425.79999999999995s)]
*  He is in a different category than any other presidential candidate, at least since the Civil War. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=431.1s)]
*  Of course, the problem with giving that man a stage and an audience braying in his favor, more than an hour of national airtime to make that pitch, is that that view, I should rule, is not a view that can be debated. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=440.3s)]
*  He is being very clear about this. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=457.5s)]
*  He is telling us he wants to destroy the Union. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=459.7s)]
*  He wants to complete the insurrection. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=462.9s)]
*  He wants to rule as a dictator. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=465.1s)]
*  That's what the 2020 stuff is. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=467.9s)]
*  That's what signing the backpack of the Jan Sixers about. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=469.9s)]
*  That is not a platform to debate or to rebut or to fact check. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=473.1s)]
*  It is a platform that simply must be defeated. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pu_fXUJYQhw&t=477.5s)]
