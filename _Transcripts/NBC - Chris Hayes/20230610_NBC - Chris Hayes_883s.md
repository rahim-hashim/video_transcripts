# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights June 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw)
*  One of the most gripping aspects of the indictment is the tale of how one of Trump's own attorneys [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=0.0s)]
*  deftly avoided being recruited into a criminal conspiracy. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=6.640000000000001s)]
*  On June 2, 2022, Trump attorney, Evan Corcoran, goes to Mar-a-Lago to review these boxes. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  And he goes there, and he's the one who's going to search the storage room, find the [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=18.04s)]
*  classified documents, show them over to the government. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=22.48s)]
*  Now, what's happened in the intervening two weeks in Suspina is that Walt Nata and the [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=24.76s)]
*  president and Trump have gotten rid of the bunch of boxes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=30.0s)]
*  Corcoran goes in, passes through, he finds 38 classified documents, he puts them in a [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=32.519999999999996s)]
*  folder, he binds them with clear duct tape. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=36.04s)]
*  He goes into Mar-a-Lago to meet with Donald Trump, who says, innocently, I'm sure, [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=39.76s)]
*  do you find anything? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=44.16s)]
*  Is it bad? [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=46.120000000000005s)]
*  Unbelievable. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=47.120000000000005s)]
*  Okay? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=48.120000000000005s)]
*  Corcoran, they talk about what to do with the folder, and I'll read from the indictment [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  here. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=54.480000000000004s)]
*  Trump and Trump attorney one then discuss what to do with the red-willed folder, this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=55.480000000000004s)]
*  is the folder that has the classified documents, containing documents with classification [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=58.16s)]
*  markings and whether Trump attorney one should bring them to his hotel room, put them in [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=61.4s)]
*  a safe there. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=65.0s)]
*  During that conversation, Trump made up plucking motions as memorialized by Trump attorney [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=66.0s)]
*  one. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=69.84s)]
*  He made a funny motion as though, well, okay, why don't you take them with you to your hotel [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=70.84s)]
*  room, and if there's anything really bad in there, like, you know, pluck it out. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=74.12s)]
*  That was the motion he made. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=78.92s)]
*  He didn't say that. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=79.92s)]
*  So this is what happens, and this is the best part. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=81.75999999999999s)]
*  And Alex, I want to get your reaction. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=84.32s)]
*  Corcoran knows this is not on the level. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=87.52s)]
*  And yet Corcoran is the lawyer who has to turn to the FBI and certify it's on the level. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=90.52s)]
*  So what Evan Corcoran does, which is pretty smart, Trump attorney one contacted another [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=96.0s)]
*  Trump attorney, Trump attorney three, and asked her if she would come to Mar-a-Lago [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  Club the next morning to act as custodian of records and sign a certification regarding [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=105.72s)]
*  the search for documents with classification markings in response to the May 11th subpoena. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=110.19999999999999s)]
*  Trump attorney three, with no role in the review, agreed. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=116.28s)]
*  I wrote in the margins there, Christina Bob thrown under bus. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=118.84s)]
*  That is what happened there. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=122.88s)]
*  Although she has shielded herself from the liability quite skillfully, that Christina [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=124.36s)]
*  Bob. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=128.12s)]
*  But the story of the way in which Trump lied to his lawyers, put them in harm's way, expected [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=129.12s)]
*  that they would do his dirty work, is stunning. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=134.2s)]
*  And it bears mentioning, because there's been so much news today, the two lawyers, John [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=136.64s)]
*  Rowley and Jim Trusty, who were handling all of this, resigned this morning. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=141.6s)]
*  Well, can I just, on the question of resign, in Trump world, resigned, fired. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=146.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=150.6s)]
*  Fine line. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=151.6s)]
*  Fine line. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=152.6s)]
*  They're gone. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=153.6s)]
*  They're gone. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=154.6s)]
*  Tim Parlatori is on CNN all the time and MSNBC talking about this case. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=155.6s)]
*  Lindsay Halligan is left on the team. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=159.56s)]
*  She has very little experience on this level at all. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=161.32s)]
*  And Todd Blanch is also representing Boris Epstein. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=165.1s)]
*  Evan Corcoran, who is the source of so much of this just damning material, is still representing [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=167.6s)]
*  Trump in the January 16th. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=173.12s)]
*  Laurence, this is what you get here from the, Corcoran is doing memos to file. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=174.84s)]
*  It's the James Comey thing, right? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=178.84s)]
*  Comey, these are a lawyerly tactic. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=180.20000000000002s)]
*  You have a conversation with Donald Trump. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=182.32s)]
*  You immediately go to Kenevrae's notes because it's like handling the fecile material. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=183.92000000000002s)]
*  It is so dangerous to be around this guy that you need to protect yourself. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=189.52s)]
*  This is your client. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=193.56s)]
*  Protect yourself with these contemporaneous notes. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=194.76s)]
*  You know, you were amused as you were describing this situation and the boxes moving around [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=196.68s)]
*  and Evan Corcoran. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=203.12s)]
*  And it is kind of funny. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=204.12s)]
*  And that continues the tone on HBO's latest version of Watergate, which is White House [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=206.12s)]
*  Plumbers where Woody Harrelson and Paul Thoreau, Paul Thoreau playing Gordon Liddy and Woody [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=213.88s)]
*  Harrelson playing E. Howard Hunt, they're playing it for the comedy because at this [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=221.0s)]
*  point they can look back at that and say, look at how crazy and silly they tried to [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=224.68s)]
*  break in four times, like three times before. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=229.52s)]
*  And things I didn't know that are goofy and silly. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=232.4s)]
*  At the time, in the present tense, none of that was regarded as goofy or silly for one [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=236.76000000000002s)]
*  second. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=242.52s)]
*  It was dead serious. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=243.52s)]
*  This thing already plays as goofy and silly, you know, when you just see it laid out here, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=244.76s)]
*  but also clearly very, very dangerous. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=251.88s)]
*  And incredibly damning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=255.72s)]
*  Rachel, the part of this that is different, and Ari made this point earlier and others [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=257.56s)]
*  have is the Corcoran piercing the attorney-client privilege because you tried very hard to recruit [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=263.16s)]
*  your lawyer into criminal conspiracy, which again, he managed to dodge, provides a window [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=270.48s)]
*  into activity and conversations that happens in maybe not one out of a thousand criminal [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=276.92s)]
*  trials. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=283.72s)]
*  You don't get the client talking to the lawyer. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=284.72s)]
*  Yeah, and there's all these quotations in the indictment where Trump is saying, you [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=289.8s)]
*  know, what if these, as you mentioned earlier, you know, wouldn't it be better if these documents [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=294.64000000000004s)]
*  weren't there at all? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=298.68s)]
*  Do we have to hand these things over? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=299.68s)]
*  Those are the kinds of questions that you can ask your lawyer, right? [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=302.68s)]
*  Between you and your lawyer, you can ask all sorts of dumb and incriminating sounding [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=305.8s)]
*  questions. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=309.92s)]
*  It's just between you and your lawyer. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=310.92s)]
*  The only reason that you should ever have those things made public beyond the relationship [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=312.12s)]
*  between you and your lawyer is if you try to engage your lawyer in the commission of [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=316.48s)]
*  a crime. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=320.0s)]
*  So don't do that. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=321.0s)]
*  And so, I mean, it's really, it's a bad thing for us to have a window into, but we have [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=322.0s)]
*  a window into it for a very specific reason. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=326.64000000000004s)]
*  But let me just, I do have one admittedly dumb question here, and maybe Andrew Weissman [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=329.08000000000004s)]
*  is best placed to answer this. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=333.6s)]
*  I thought it was surprising that when we got the indictment unsealed and when we learned [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=335.8s)]
*  that Trump was indicted, also his lawyers resigned. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=340.92s)]
*  Is there anything about this indictment that says why two of his lawyers had to resign? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=343.96000000000004s)]
*  Was it an obvious consequence of this indictment? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=349.76s)]
*  What did you make of the fact that that was, that those things happened coincident? [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=353.8s)]
*  I thought, I didn't think that it was about the substance of the charges. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=360.24s)]
*  I thought there were two possible explanations. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=364.88s)]
*  One explanation is that when you are handling the investigation and you have a client who's [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=369.40000000000003s)]
*  hoping not to get indicted, when the indictment comes in, the client says, thank you so much. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=377.04s)]
*  You didn't accomplish what, the client blames the lawyers, even though, of course, usually [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=383.68s)]
*  the problem is the client, not the lawyers, because it's what they did that's leading [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=389.40000000000003s)]
*  this. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=393.44s)]
*  So that's one possibility. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=394.44s)]
*  He's just honestly upset that they didn't do their job when they, in fact, could have. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=395.92s)]
*  The second is that once you file a notice of appearance, once you as a lawyer appear [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=401.4s)]
*  in a criminal case, not just in the investigation, but you actually say, I am representing Donald [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=408.0s)]
*  Trump in a criminal case, you cannot withdraw without court permission. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=413.76s)]
*  And a lot of times judges will say, you're in. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=419.04s)]
*  So what do people do? [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=422.36s)]
*  They do something which I referred to when I was a baby prosecutor and someone said, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=424.08000000000004s)]
*  the defense lawyer was like, well, I'm not yet in the case. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=429.12s)]
*  And I was like, well, why not? [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=431.36s)]
*  And he said, I'm waiting for Mr. Green. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=432.36s)]
*  And I didn't know what that meant. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=435.12s)]
*  And Mr. Green is a reference to money. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=436.44s)]
*  And it's just sort of a euphemism that certainly was used in Brooklyn all the time. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=440.28000000000003s)]
*  And so here you can imagine the two defense lawyers saying, look, if I'm going to stay [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=445.14000000000004s)]
*  in the case and I'm going to file a notice of appearance, there's a certain amount of [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=449.8s)]
*  money that needs to be paid now if I'm going to be stuck representing you for what could [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=453.42s)]
*  be a lengthy, as you noted, a lengthy period of time. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=458.82s)]
*  And Trump is known not to pay his lawyers. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=461.7s)]
*  He very much is, although he keeps finding them. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=463.02000000000004s)]
*  Coming up. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=465.02000000000004s)]
*  And this is the other person who's indicted in this case. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=467.46000000000004s)]
*  This is Walt Nauta. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=471.26s)]
*  And here are his crimes. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=472.26s)]
*  And his crime is in bold twice, where he is in an interview. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=474.04s)]
*  It's a voluntary interview with the FBI. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=478.54s)]
*  He's served in the Navy. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=482.66s)]
*  He's supposed to know it's a crime to lie in this discussion. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=484.66s)]
*  And he's asked, this is a guy who's been moving the boxes. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=488.66s)]
*  He knows exactly where they are. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=491.46000000000004s)]
*  He's been delivering them to Trump's office and all that stuff. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=492.82s)]
*  He knows which one Trump is looking at today. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=496.02000000000004s)]
*  So he says this when they say to him, do you have any information that could help us understand [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=498.5s)]
*  like where they were kept, how they were kept, where they were secured, were they locked? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=503.26s)]
*  You know, something that makes the intelligence community feel better about these things, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=508.1s)]
*  and he says, I wish I could tell you. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=512.22s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=515.22s)]
*  I don't. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=516.22s)]
*  I honestly just don't. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=517.22s)]
*  This is the guy. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=518.22s)]
*  This is the box guy. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=519.22s)]
*  Like his whole life has been the boxes for the last couple of months. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=520.22s)]
*  The final question to it. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=524.22s)]
*  So that sentence is in bold because that's a crime. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=525.22s)]
*  The final sentence is, so you didn't know. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=528.22s)]
*  You have no idea how they got there before. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=531.22s)]
*  And he says no. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=533.22s)]
*  And the word no is bolded because that too is his crime. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=535.22s)]
*  And I just want to encourage the audience. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=538.22s)]
*  That's how easy this thing is legally and to read. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=540.6600000000001s)]
*  He'll be selling bound copies of it. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=543.6600000000001s)]
*  We're actually doing an audiobook version. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=545.6600000000001s)]
*  Well, of course you, an industrious man that you are. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=548.6600000000001s)]
*  Page eight, you see the agencies that have information that's been compromised here. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=551.6600000000001s)]
*  This is not the PTA. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=556.6600000000001s)]
*  This is the National Geospatial Intelligence Agency. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=559.6600000000001s)]
*  That's the analysis of imagery, imagery intelligence and geospatial information in support of [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=563.6600000000001s)]
*  national security objectives. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=569.1s)]
*  The Department of Energy in terms of nuclear deterrent information. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=570.1s)]
*  The Department of State and Bureau of Intelligence and Research. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=574.1s)]
*  This is serious information. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=576.1s)]
*  And I go back to Walt Nauta, who is the only other person named in this. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=578.1s)]
*  And at once it's the mendacity is so flagrant. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=583.1s)]
*  It's hard to have pity for this person. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=586.1s)]
*  At the same time. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=588.1s)]
*  I've got a fair amount. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=589.1s)]
*  And knowing, knowing firsthand some of the people who work, these Navy guys who work [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=590.1s)]
*  as aides to the president, as who work as ballots, who work as body men. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=596.5400000000001s)]
*  This is the honor of a lifetime for them. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=599.5400000000001s)]
*  And the way in which I can only presume Donald Trump took advantage of this man's allegiance [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=602.5400000000001s)]
*  to his president. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=608.5400000000001s)]
*  And the fact that he was willing to lie so flagrantly to Department of Justice investigators [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=610.5400000000001s)]
*  is an American tragedy. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=615.5400000000001s)]
*  And by the way, there is a moment in this document where they talk about Donald Trump [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=616.5400000000001s)]
*  having a phone call with Walt Nauta for about 29 seconds after which he moves boxes. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=620.98s)]
*  They're told on May 11th, there's a subpoena, you got to give him back. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=626.98s)]
*  Corcoran says, give him back. [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=629.98s)]
*  Walt Nauta is the one who does these moves from May. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=630.98s)]
*  He does them on May 24th. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=634.98s)]
*  He moves three of them. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=635.98s)]
*  May 31st, he moves another 50. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=636.98s)]
*  June 1st, he moves 11 more. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=639.98s)]
*  June 2nd, he moves 30 more. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=641.98s)]
*  And then in July, the FBI and the grand jury obtained and reviewed surveillance video from [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=645.4200000000001s)]
*  the Mar-a-Lago Club showing the movement of boxes. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=651.4200000000001s)]
*  And so Donald Trump, and I think in all things large and small, Donald Trump's habit, like [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=654.4200000000001s)]
*  a mob boss, is to get someone like Walt Nauta to do the dirty work for him. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=659.4200000000001s)]
*  He's instructing him before each of these movements of boxes, including him talking [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=664.4200000000001s)]
*  to some woman who could be Melania or maybe could be Ivanka. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=670.4200000000001s)]
*  We were debating it earlier. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=674.86s)]
*  And he's told, you know what, there's not enough room on the plane because we're going [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=675.86s)]
*  to put for all these boxes to go to Bedminster. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=678.86s)]
*  And he's like, oh, no, he's going to go through them. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=681.86s)]
*  He's not going to want the whole box. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=683.86s)]
*  He is the one communicating and physically moving the boxes. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=685.62s)]
*  He's caught on tape. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=689.14s)]
*  And then he's the one interviewed by the FBI and lies. [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=690.62s)]
*  This guy, I mean, it's hard not to feel a bit of pity for him because he's the little [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=694.5s)]
*  guy. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=699.2199999999999s)]
*  He's paying his legal bills, but he faces the exact same consequences as somebody who [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=701.02s)]
*  is so rich and had so much power. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=705.1800000000001s)]
*  And the two men are going to be in a courthouse standing next to each other like the Home [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=707.34s)]
*  Alone Burger on Tuesday morning. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=711.94s)]
*  That's an additional legal problem for Donald Trump, because if he were a standalone defendant, [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=714.62s)]
*  I actually think he'd be in a better position when and if sentencing comes around. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=719.3000000000001s)]
*  This guy, people have gone to prison for what this guy has done. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=726.1800000000001s)]
*  And the idea that like, well, there is no principle that says, oh, no, no, you can't [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=731.38s)]
*  convict a Navy veteran of a crime. [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=735.82s)]
*  All of this kind of mythology that surrounds the notion of convicting a former president. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=739.22s)]
*  So I actually think them having a co-defendant in there who is by all previous legal precedent [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=744.34s)]
*  completely vulnerable to serious criminal sentencing here is actually very helpful. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=751.5s)]
*  Rachel, what do you think about that? [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=756.34s)]
*  That we have two defendants here. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=759.82s)]
*  And just the story told through this indictment of this individual essentially being recruited [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=762.62s)]
*  into a criminal conspiracy, not the only one Donald Trump tries to recruit into a criminal [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=767.66s)]
*  conspiracy. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=773.94s)]
*  He basically attempts to do the same with his lawyer, who is deft enough to extricate [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=774.94s)]
*  himself. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=777.98s)]
*  We'll get to that in a moment. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=778.98s)]
*  That's part of the story in this indictment as well. [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=780.46s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=782.5s)]
*  And I think it's a really astute point by Lawrence that you, you know, in every jury [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=783.5s)]
*  considering a case like this, you know, they're taught about precedent. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=787.82s)]
*  They're taught about light crimes. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=791.5s)]
*  They're taught about, you know, the seriousness of the offense and all of those things over [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=792.5s)]
*  the course of their participation in it. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=795.14s)]
*  But when they're looking at somebody like Walt Nauta, who isn't going to have, you know, [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=796.9s)]
*  the world rising up and saying that it's the death of the republic if he's convicted of [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=800.82s)]
*  something, if he's plainly guilty of something, that's going to make it harder to say that [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=804.86s)]
*  Mr. Nauta ought to be convicted and Mr. Trump shouldn't because of something else mystical [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=809.06s)]
*  about him that makes him a different kind of citizen. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=812.9399999999999s)]
*  I think that's a really astute point by Lawrence. [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=815.66s)]
*  I will also just say, you know, I know in our earlier coverage, there was some discussion [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=817.8199999999999s)]
*  as to whether or not Mr. Nauta might feel like he wanted to plead guilty, like he might [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=821.66s)]
*  want to cooperate, like he might want to not be on the, at the sharp end of this stick [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=826.9s)]
*  any longer. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=831.74s)]
*  I think it's, it may be heretical for me to say it and everybody can shut me down, but [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=832.9399999999999s)]
*  I think we should also talk about the possibility that Donald Trump might plead. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=837.02s)]
*  Donald Trump is looking at decades and decades and decades in prison. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=841.26s)]
*  And this indictment is very straightforward and not complicated and doesn't leave a lot [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=846.1s)]
*  out and it tells you very much what they've got to use against him. [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=850.34s)]
*  I mean, if it were you, would you consider pleading guilty to this for, in exchange for [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=853.42s)]
*  lenience? [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=857.78s)]
*  I might. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=858.78s)]
*  Yesterday. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=859.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=860.78s)]
*  And we're not really contending with that. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_2g0sX5BbKw&t=861.78s)]
