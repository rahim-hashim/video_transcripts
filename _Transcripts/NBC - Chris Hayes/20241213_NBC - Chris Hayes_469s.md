# Hayes: Trump and his billionaire friends have ‘amnesia’ about this issue
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20)
*  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=0.0s)]
*  One thing that the incoming Trump administration and its billionaire backers are very excited [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=2.5s)]
*  about is deregulation. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=7.0200000000000005s)]
*  Because no one likes regulations, right? [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=9.4s)]
*  All those business killing laws and annoying obstacles. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=11.6s)]
*  Amazon founder and Washington Post owner and $1 million donor to the Trump inauguration [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=14.56s)]
*  Jeff Bezos is very optimistic. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=18.66s)]
*  If we're talking about Trump, I think it's very interesting. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=22.240000000000002s)]
*  I'm actually very optimistic this time around that we're going to see... [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=25.72s)]
*  I'm very hopeful about this... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=31.0s)]
*  He seems to have a lot of energy around reducing regulation. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  And my point of view, if I can help him do that, I'm going to help him. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=39.48s)]
*  Because we do have too much regulation in this country. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=43.239999999999995s)]
*  Too much regulation. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=46.519999999999996s)]
*  So where do we start? [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=47.7s)]
*  What do you think is a possible primary target in this war on regulations? [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=48.7s)]
*  How about the money in your bank account? [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=53.0s)]
*  According to the Wall Street Journal, in recent interviews with potential nominees to lead [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=55.599999999999994s)]
*  bank regulatory agencies, President-elect Donald Trump's advisors and officials from [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=59.599999999999994s)]
*  his newfound Department of Government Efficiency, which is just a thing that's not connected [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=63.879999999999995s)]
*  to the government, have asked whether he could abolish the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=68.52s)]
*  People familiar with the matter said. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=74.14s)]
*  First, don't miss the fact that these possible federal regulators are getting interview questions [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=75.92s)]
*  from Doge officials. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=80.47999999999999s)]
*  Doge is not an actual government thing. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=82.56s)]
*  It's a side product for Trump-supporting rich guys, Elon Musk and Vivek Ramaswamy. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=84.96s)]
*  Deregulation is one of those things that sounds great, I think, to everybody in the abstract. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=89.32s)]
*  We have all in our lives bumped up against some regulation and had to file some forms [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=93.52s)]
*  or deal with a weird part of the building code that felt like a pain and unnecessary. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=98.08s)]
*  And also, some regulations really are bad. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=103.11999999999999s)]
*  For instance, the regulations that prevent many cities from building as much housing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=106.47999999999999s)]
*  as they really need for their people. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=110.5s)]
*  But that sure isn't what Trump and his billionaires are talking about. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=112.96s)]
*  And they're only talking about it because of America's frequent amnesia about why some [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=115.39999999999999s)]
*  regulations exist to begin with. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=121.03999999999999s)]
*  It reminds me of this weird and cringey right-wing meme that goes around the kind of Musk-Bro [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=124.11999999999999s)]
*  Twittersphere. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=129.78s)]
*  Here it is being recited this year at Liberty University. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=131.51999999999998s)]
*  Hard times create strong men. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=136.12s)]
*  Strong men create easy times. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=139.0s)]
*  Easy times create weak men. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=141.04s)]
*  And weak men create hard times. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=143.56s)]
*  Ah, yes. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=146.0s)]
*  When things are tough and bad, strong men like Vivek Ramaswamy rise. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=147.28s)]
*  And only through that strength can we secure a life of peace and comfort. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=154.88s)]
*  But wait, that makes all the men soft and weak again? [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  And then the bad times come back and the cycle repeats. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=163.12s)]
*  Yes, it's a dumb sort of online tough guy kind of thing. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=165.68s)]
*  It's particularly funny because I think a lot of times the people posting about it are [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=170.2s)]
*  basically like 15-year-olds playing video games. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=172.51999999999998s)]
*  But I am reminded of it lately because I think it maybe does actually capture a dynamic we've [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=175.88s)]
*  seen before in America and we are starting to see again right now. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=180.0s)]
*  Which is how our appetite for regulations comes and goes and cycles. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=183.64s)]
*  We have regulation for a reason. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=188.84s)]
*  Bad times, catastrophes, and disasters bring about good regulations. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=190.72s)]
*  Good regulation creates the conditions that prevent disasters. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=194.92s)]
*  So you've had the Chicago fire or the Triangle shirtwaist fire. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=199.1s)]
*  That's when you get a push for fire codes and factory safe-leave regulations and fewer [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=203.22s)]
*  tragedies result. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=207.38s)]
*  And then you go around long enough without a tragedy and you think, geez, we really haven't [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=209.18s)]
*  had a fire in a while. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=212.66s)]
*  Not like a big one. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=213.66s)]
*  Do we really need all these building codes? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=214.66s)]
*  You think you've vanquished the problem. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=217.66s)]
*  And the historical memory of just how bad things can get has faded. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=220.1s)]
*  And so get rid of these regulations. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=223.38s)]
*  And guess what comes roaring back? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=226.14s)]
*  I mean, we have seen this exact cycle with financial regulation. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=228.18s)]
*  Back in the 1920s, the age of easy credit and securities, there was a huge push to deregulate [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=232.66s)]
*  banks and businesses. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=238.02s)]
*  And you'll never guess what happened. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=239.66s)]
*  A stock market crash and a Great Depression. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=241.62s)]
*  An experience so foundationally traumatic for America that FDR's New Deal government [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=244.12s)]
*  rolled out a whole slew of banking regulations, including, you guessed it, the FDIC. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=248.38s)]
*  That's the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation to stop bank runs and shore up the financial [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=254.02s)]
*  system. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=259.22s)]
*  And that system worked really well. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=260.5s)]
*  We basically in this country stopped having bank failures for decades. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=262.0s)]
*  As time went on, there was, of course, a push to deregulate. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=266.78000000000003s)]
*  Starting the 1980s with Reagan and the savings and loans, and then the 1990s with Clinton [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=272.38s)]
*  and finally in the aughts under George W. Bush. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=276.42s)]
*  It wasn't the 1930s anymore. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=279.28000000000003s)]
*  We figured it out. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=281.8s)]
*  We didn't need financial regulation. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=282.8s)]
*  We were in good times. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=284.3s)]
*  We should just let banks operate more like casinos and use your deposits to make tons [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=285.48s)]
*  of leverage bets on risky mergers for overvalued homes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=290.06s)]
*  And you'll just never guess what happened. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=293.5s)]
*  Tonight meltdown. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=296.6s)]
*  The American financial system is rocked to its foundation as top Wall Street institutions [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=297.6s)]
*  topple under a mountain of debt. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=303.06s)]
*  Coming up tonight, how did it happen? [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=305.42s)]
*  What's next? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=307.36s)]
*  And how safe is your money? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=308.36s)]
*  It was America's worst, most devastating financial crisis since the Great Depression. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=310.65999999999997s)]
*  It just created tremendous amounts of misery and destruction, screwed up so many people's [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=315.65999999999997s)]
*  lives and lasted in its effects for a decade. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=320.26s)]
*  So after that, we got another round of new regulations limiting just how fast and loose [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=324.09999999999997s)]
*  banks can play with your money. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=329.18s)]
*  And that new regulation drives bank CEOs generally crazy. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=331.44s)]
*  They don't like it, but it's worked pretty well. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=334.06s)]
*  Do you remember last year we had a couple of high profile bank failures, Silicon Valley [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=337.32000000000005s)]
*  Bank, First Republican Signature. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=340.56s)]
*  Together they were actually worth more than all of the 25 banks that failed in the Great [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=342.40000000000003s)]
*  Recession. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=346.56s)]
*  But instead of another systemic failure, the system held in large part because the regulatory [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=347.92s)]
*  environment stopped it from spreading and cascading. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=353.12s)]
*  And so now some in the incoming Trump administration are openly talking about getting rid of the [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  FDIC, which is one of the greatest banking regulation inventions of all time. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=362.62s)]
*  It's the agency that guarantees if your bank does fail, you get your money back, insuring [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=366.82s)]
*  it up to a quarter million dollars. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=371.9s)]
*  It also means if banks start to look like they're going to fail, people don't rush [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=373.44s)]
*  to take their money out, thereby causing bank failures. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=376.64s)]
*  Right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=379.74s)]
*  Bank runs. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=381.3s)]
*  It doesn't cost taxpayers anything. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=382.86s)]
*  The money for payouts actually comes from a premium. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=384.38s)]
*  The government charges the banks in genius. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=386.64s)]
*  The riskier your bank is, the higher its insurance premiums. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=389.76s)]
*  So you can guess who doesn't like this system, who would rather not pay into it. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=391.96000000000004s)]
*  But it's a system that helped restore American confidence in banks and helped banks thrive [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=396.2s)]
*  along the way. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=399.72s)]
*  As the journals reporting noted, FDIC deposit insurance is considered near-sacred. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=401.3s)]
*  Any move that threatened to undermine even the perception of deposit insurance could [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=406.16s)]
*  quickly ripple through banks and in a crisis might compound customer fears. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=409.32s)]
*  Yeah, it might do that. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=413.12s)]
*  Might do that if your deposit insurance went away. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=414.72s)]
*  But the incoming administration and the Bezos and Musks of the world don't seem to care. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0vVOuXmQM20&t=419.04s)]
