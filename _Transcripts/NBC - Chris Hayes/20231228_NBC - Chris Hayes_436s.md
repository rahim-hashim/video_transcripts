Video Description: Rep. Maxine Waters on Rep.

# Maxine Waters slams Lauren Boebert for switching districts to boost 2024 chances
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 28, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g)
*  Remember these guys? [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=0.0s)]
*  The Republican Young Guns. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=2.3000000000000003s)]
*  In 2010, they were the boy band generation of Republicans who were going to change the [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=3.94s)]
*  party. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=9.02s)]
*  You know, Paul Ryan of the P90X flexing, you know, he was the cute one, and Kevin McCarthy [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=10.02s)]
*  was the tax-loving sensitive one, and Eric Cantor was the bad boy. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=15.74s)]
*  They rounded out a group that would fuse Tea Party politics with wonky policies. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=20.5s)]
*  And well, you know how that worked out. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=25.46s)]
*  Ryan and McCarthy ultimately lost their leadership roles. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=27.32s)]
*  Cantor couldn't even win a reelection primary. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  Now, instead of boy bands, House Republicans are a bunch of proud boys. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=32.92s)]
*  Gun-loving MAGA extremists like Jim Jordan, Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Lauren Boebert, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=37.92s)]
*  who post memes instead of actually passing laws. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=42.64s)]
*  Now heading into the 2024 election, it looks like nobody wants to hear their tired old [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=45.760000000000005s)]
*  songs anymore. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=50.08s)]
*  Yesterday, Boebert confirmed she is switching from her purple Colorado district to a deep [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=51.32s)]
*  red one in hopes of winning reelection. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=56.76s)]
*  That is after she was nearly knocked off by her Democratic challenger last year. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=60.099999999999994s)]
*  What would we say about the future of the Democratic Party if prominent members like [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=63.82s)]
*  Eric Swalwell or AOC had to go district shopping in order to stay in power? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=68.58s)]
*  Long-term California Congresswoman Maxine Waters currently serves as the top Democrat [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=74.34s)]
*  on the House Financial Services Committee. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=78.74s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=80.66s)]
*  Thank you so much, Congresswoman Waters. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=81.66s)]
*  I have to start with this. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=83.38s)]
*  You have served in office. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=85.3s)]
*  You have advised presidents. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=87.03999999999999s)]
*  You have seen ups and downs of the Democratic Party. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=88.42s)]
*  If Eric Swalwell, if AOC, if you had to go district shopping in order to get reelected, [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=92.06s)]
*  what would that be saying about the state of the Democratic Party? [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=98.74s)]
*  Well, it would be saying that we are not capable of representing the districts where we have [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=101.52s)]
*  started out and now we want to switch and we go look for something else. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=109.3s)]
*  Maybe we would get elected in a different district, but both parties are not going to [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=114.48s)]
*  get elected in a different district. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=118.96000000000001s)]
*  She was caught publicly vaping and not only was she doing that, she was being groped, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=120.80000000000001s)]
*  she was being felt on by the boyfriend. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=129.0s)]
*  Now this is a representative of the United States of America who has the audacity to [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=132.4s)]
*  talk about caring about children and education and families. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=137.58s)]
*  Even if she goes to a new district that is more conservative, I think those conservative [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=142.7s)]
*  members of those districts will understand that this is not someone that they want to [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=148.01999999999998s)]
*  serve as a representative for them because of what she is transporting to their children. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=152.94s)]
*  You know, it's interesting. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=159.66s)]
*  She's trying to go into Ken Buck's former district. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=161.17999999999998s)]
*  Yes. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=163.45999999999998s)]
*  And Ken Buck was one of the Republicans saying, hey, we're not getting anything done. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=164.45999999999998s)]
*  He was tired of people like Lauren Boebert. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=167.29999999999998s)]
*  As someone who's worked with presidents and gotten things done, somebody who talked down [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=170.18s)]
*  Donald Trump and worked with Barack Obama, worked with members, what is it like being [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=174.44s)]
*  in a Congress right now that can't seem to get anything done? [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=178.96s)]
*  I mean, this is the least productive House of Representatives session since 1989. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=182.1s)]
*  Only 20 bills passed and signed into law. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=189.08s)]
*  What's that like for you who's so used to actually getting things done in Congress? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=191.38s)]
*  Well, actually, it's pathetic on the Republican side. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=194.22s)]
*  They can't govern. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=197.3s)]
*  They're in disarray. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=198.42000000000002s)]
*  It is chaotic. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=200.18s)]
*  It is pitiful. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=201.18s)]
*  Out of, you know, 700 votes or so, they got, what, 27 votes all year and only 26 of them [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=202.18s)]
*  were passed. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=210.14000000000001s)]
*  And so they're incapable of directing and running this government. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=211.26000000000002s)]
*  And so they're in deep trouble. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=216.38000000000002s)]
*  And if they think somehow that is not going to be understood by the American public and [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=217.98000000000002s)]
*  they're going to win because they're all hiding behind Donald Trump, it's not going to happen. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=223.62s)]
*  We're going to take back the House for sure. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=229.14s)]
*  I have to ask you this because one of the things that you often hear political analysts, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=231.14s)]
*  pundits, journalists talk about is where is the enthusiasm going to be for the Democratic [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=236.9s)]
*  Party? [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=241.62s)]
*  You are probably one of the most well-known members of Congress on either side of the [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=242.62s)]
*  party. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=246.22s)]
*  You are memed. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=247.38s)]
*  You are known by older voters and younger voters and everything else like that. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=248.66s)]
*  What do you think your role will be in 2024 when it comes to speaking to those people [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=253.04s)]
*  who are disenchanted, speaking to those people who say it's a pox on both houses, the Democrats [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=258.58s)]
*  can't get anything in the public. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=261.85999999999996s)]
*  What are you going to say to those people next year to make sure that they turn out [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=263.5s)]
*  and vote so that the House can get back into hands? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=265.9s)]
*  One of the things I think we need to do is remind people of what we have done and what [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=268.06s)]
*  Democrats have accomplished and what Biden has done. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=272.85999999999996s)]
*  We did a remarkable job doing covert, making sure that people had food on the table. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=276.14s)]
*  Don't forget the PPP loan that we created in order for small businesses to have an opportunity [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=281.7s)]
*  to keep their personnel and to keep those doors open. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=288.42s)]
*  So Biden has done a great job. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=291.34000000000003s)]
*  And for the young people, what do you think has happened to the debt that they owe because [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=293.38000000000005s)]
*  of their student loans? [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=298.54s)]
*  He's reduced that. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=299.90000000000003s)]
*  He's working at it. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=301.06s)]
*  And he's done a good job. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=302.46000000000004s)]
*  He really has been a strong Democrat who has delivered and he's promised a lot and he's [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=303.70000000000005s)]
*  delivered a lot. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=310.02000000000004s)]
*  And for black people, he has certainly delivered. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  I tend to be skeptical when I see all these numbers that say, oh, black folks are voting [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=314.54s)]
*  for Trump. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=318.5s)]
*  I don't buy it. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=319.5s)]
*  I don't know a lot of African-Americans. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=320.5s)]
*  I don't know a lot of black folk. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=322.22s)]
*  I don't know a lot of anybody who says that they're voting for Trump. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=323.58s)]
*  When you hear those kinds of things, when you hear it said by serious journalists and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=326.58s)]
*  everything else like that, that black people, in particular black men, are moving to the [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=330.5s)]
*  Republican Party, is that what you're seeing on the ground? [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=334.38s)]
*  Is that what you see in L.A.? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=336.54s)]
*  No, I hear a little bit of that. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=337.54s)]
*  But sometimes I think that's done to create controversy. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=339.9s)]
*  And I think that people want to see if young people are going to start to talk like they're [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=343.65999999999997s)]
*  talking about supporting Trump. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=349.46s)]
*  It's not going to happen. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=352.7s)]
*  Black people understand who their friends are. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=354.62s)]
*  Black people understand what Trump has done in dividing and conquering and that he's aligned [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=357.06s)]
*  not only with the KKK, but with the Proud Boys, with the Oath Keepers, with the QAnon. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=362.34s)]
*  These are domestic terrorists who are out not only to undermine our democracy and disregard [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=369.1s)]
*  the Constitution, and they're going to be happy. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=375.98s)]
*  Young people are going to be happy to elect someone that they said wants to, he said he [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=380.34000000000003s)]
*  wants to be a dictator. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=384.70000000000005s)]
*  I don't think so. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=386.14000000000004s)]
*  When it gets down to it, black people are going to turn out in large numbers. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=387.82000000000005s)]
*  Young people are going to turn out in large numbers. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=391.86s)]
*  I want to tell you that independents are going to turn out because they know that this man [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=394.42s)]
*  who loves Russia, who loves dictators, who loves Putin and speaks up for him and who's [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=399.9s)]
*  aligned with him is not good for this country or our democracy. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=405.94s)]
*  Always love, always love talking to the congressman, Maxine Waters. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=410.18s)]
*  Thank you so much for joining us this evening on All In. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8tFlIkTqw8g&t=414.26s)]
