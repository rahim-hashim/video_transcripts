# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Sept. 21
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w)
*  So Donald Trump has made his counter-programming plan for next week's second Republican debate. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=0.0s)]
*  He's going to head to Detroit, where he's going to deliver a speech in front of hundreds [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=6.12s)]
*  of autoworkers who, of course, remain on strike from the nation's three biggest manufacturers. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=9.42s)]
*  It is a notable play for the frontrunner of the Republican nomination because, for the [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=15.1s)]
*  better part of the last century, the Republican Party has been the party of the bosses. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=19.96s)]
*  It's the party of management over labor. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=25.0s)]
*  It's a core, core part of the identity, a central Republican belief. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=27.06s)]
*  For decades, decades, it has been the case that if you elect a Republican president, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=32.739999999999995s)]
*  you will get a federal government that is much more hostile to organized labor. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=37.46s)]
*  And crucially, this is important, this was also true under the last Republican president, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=41.4s)]
*  a guy by the name of Donald Trump. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=47.26s)]
*  Donald Trump appointed anti-labor members to the National Labor Relations Board. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=49.86s)]
*  He chose Eugene Scalia, son of conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia and a [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=54.06s)]
*  longtime corporate lawyer, to lead the Department of Labor. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=58.940000000000005s)]
*  He elevated anti-worker judges to the federal courts, who consistently have been ruling [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=62.64s)]
*  against labor in their perches on the bench. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=66.8s)]
*  Now Donald Trump and his party of bosses have a bit of a political problem. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=70.26s)]
*  You see, something is happening in America. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=75.46000000000001s)]
*  We are witnessing an enormous resurgence of pro-labor enthusiasm. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=77.96000000000001s)]
*  Nearly 70% of Americans support labor unions, a number that has been steadily rising for [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=82.46000000000001s)]
*  the past decade. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=88.42s)]
*  75% of Americans, 75% say they side with the autoworkers in their current dispute. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=89.86s)]
*  So when you look at those poll numbers, what is a Republican to do in the face of that [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=96.66s)]
*  clear public opinion and a strike with no end in sight? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=100.94s)]
*  Now some, like presidential hopefuls Nikki Haley and Tim Scott, notably both from one [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=104.6s)]
*  of the most anti-union states in the country, South Carolina, are sticking to the old party [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=109.66s)]
*  line. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=114.34s)]
*  You almost have to respect it. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=115.34s)]
*  Scott even suggested firing workers who go on strike. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=117.14s)]
*  But the more sophisticated political operators have managed to reverse engineer a perfect [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=121.22s)]
*  scapegoat for the whole situation. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=128.01999999999998s)]
*  Woke cars. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=130.62s)]
*  I think the workers are right. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=133.18s)]
*  They need higher wages. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=134.22s)]
*  And importantly, we need to stop the premature push to electric vehicles that's putting a [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=135.62s)]
*  lot of Ohio autoworkers out of a job. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=139.7s)]
*  I guarantee you that one of the things that's driving that strike is that Bidenomics and [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=141.98s)]
*  their green energy electric vehicle agenda is good for Beijing and bad for Detroit. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=149.7s)]
*  They want to destroy the autoworkers in this country. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=155.98s)]
*  They want to have cars made all electric. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=159.22s)]
*  They're all going to be made within three years. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=161.3s)]
*  They're all going to be made in China. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=163.22s)]
*  The electric vehicles are the problem, not the corporations, the bosses, or the record [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=166.06s)]
*  profits not translating to record contracts or the two tier system put in when Detroit [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=169.46s)]
*  was flat on its back and the American people rescued them. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=174.74s)]
*  No, it's the woke environmental agenda. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=177.3s)]
*  It's the electric cars, which of course we need for the future to mitigate the biggest [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=179.7s)]
*  civilizational threat we've ever met. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=183.26s)]
*  This line is a great way for Republicans to avoid sounding like the anti-union bosses [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=186.66s)]
*  lackeys that they in fact are. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=192.3s)]
*  And they are helped by the fact it does contain a kernel of truth. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=194.86s)]
*  There's a lot of anxiety among the autoworkers union about the transition to electric, especially [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=197.62s)]
*  with the country's biggest electric automaker Tesla not being unionized. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=202.42000000000002s)]
*  Would be great if it was unionized. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=207.34s)]
*  I'm not sure Donald Trump would support that one. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=209.14000000000001s)]
*  Now you can be sure that Donald Trump will harp on electric vehicles again in Detroit [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=212.22000000000003s)]
*  when he speaks in front of the striking autoworkers next week. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=216.54000000000002s)]
*  And it will be a real test of the political press. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=219.6s)]
*  Will they just focus on the optics, Donald Trump courts union voters, or will they dig [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=225.2s)]
*  into the actual substance of Trump's actual record on labor when he was actually the president [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=231.45999999999998s)]
*  of the United States, as well as the record of his party versus that of President Joe [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=237.88s)]
*  Biden, a president who's filled the national labor relations board with some of the most [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=243.6s)]
*  pro labor appointees in memory. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=248.24s)]
*  Now I have to say, this is exactly what Politico just did, meeting the test when they followed [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=250.4s)]
*  up on a story about the optics of Trump's speech with this piece about his clear and [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=255.0s)]
*  consistent anti-labor record in office. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=260.48s)]
*  Kudos to Politico for that. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=264.52s)]
*  But this is a key test a whole lot of outlets failed in 2016. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=267.32s)]
*  And if we do not want that to happen again, we cannot just report on what Donald Trump [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=272.2s)]
*  says on its face. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=276.16s)]
*  Donald Trump was the president of the United States. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=278.68s)]
*  In that position, he wielded real power. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=280.72s)]
*  He has a substantive record beneath his words, and everyone has a responsibility to tell [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=283.08000000000004s)]
*  the full truth about that. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=287.88000000000005s)]
*  Fox News has contributed to what is happening, which is basically the alienation of a key [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=292.6s)]
*  constituency in American politics. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=297.58000000000004s)]
*  What we used to call moderate Republicans, swing voters who were once persuadable, but [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=300.12s)]
*  a lot of them have just now become basically Democrats. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=305.16s)]
*  That is the thesis of a new piece by Ben Jacobs in the New Republic. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=309.16s)]
*  Are never Trumpers actually just Democrats now? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=312.6s)]
*  And the author of that piece, Ben Jacobs, joins me now. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=315.84000000000003s)]
*  Ben, I really enjoyed the piece and I was reading it thinking of what we were talking [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=318.88000000000005s)]
*  about special elections yesterday. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=322.16s)]
*  What's your basic thesis to the piece? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=323.88s)]
*  The basic thesis is that Donald Trump has provoked this great realignment in American [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  politics that for all the attention we spent after 2016 going to the mythical Rust Belt [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=330.84s)]
*  diners in Ohio and Pennsylvania where there are Obama Trump voters, there are a lot of [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=336.91999999999996s)]
*  now Romney Biden voters in the suburbs in places like outside Phoenix, outside Atlanta, [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=341.4s)]
*  and that if you go to the Lululemons, if you go to the Whole Foods there, there are a lot [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=346.96s)]
*  of people who were once traditional country club Republicans who are now voting for Democrats [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=350.52s)]
*  in most races, not all races, but certainly for president, for US Senate, as we've seen [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=357.34s)]
*  in Georgia, in Arizona, and starting to move down ballot as well. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=363.61999999999995s)]
*  Yeah, this is what's key, right? [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=368.06s)]
*  So we've known that there are these swing voters. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=369.53999999999996s)]
*  But one of the things you say is the endurance of never Trump Republicans means that a not [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=371.9s)]
*  insignificant number of George W. Bush and Mitt Romney voters from pundits on down to [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=375.41999999999996s)]
*  suburban parents are now part of the Democratic base and participating in party primaries. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=380.02s)]
*  What you're saying is it's not just the voting behavior. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=384.90000000000003s)]
*  It's actually like a deeper partisan association affiliation that's happening. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=387.5s)]
*  Like these people are becoming Democrats, self-identified, their voting behavior, and [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=391.82s)]
*  even to a certain extent how they might start seeing issues. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=397.5s)]
*  Yes, that's precisely right. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=400.22s)]
*  That in your seeing this impact in data that the voters who are leaving the Republican [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=403.46000000000004s)]
*  Party are more likely to be pro-choice, they're more likely to be pro-immigration reform, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=408.34000000000003s)]
*  and that you're seeing this sort of rearrangement of the parties, that these voters are also [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=413.06s)]
*  disproportionately well-educated, and that you're seeing a re-sorting of these voters [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=417.5s)]
*  as they're approaching these issues, and as Donald Trump in particular has become this [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=422.78s)]
*  sort of repellent figure. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=427.09999999999997s)]
*  And some of this was happening already, that this is the analogy I use, that there's sort [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=428.85999999999996s)]
*  of tectonic forces, that there's this low steady shift, that some of these areas were [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=432.62s)]
*  creeping slowly towards Democrats. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=436.85999999999996s)]
*  Donald Trump just put it on steroids in the same way that the upper Midwest, parts of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=439.21999999999997s)]
*  the upper Midwest, have gone towards Republicans in the past decade. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=443.3s)]
*  These prosperous, well-educated suburban areas have really zoomed in the other direction. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=447.06s)]
*  What do you think it means for the political fortunes of the two coalitions, and what did [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=452.5s)]
*  you hear from folks when you went and reported this out? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=456.38s)]
*  What it means for the political coalitions is that you're now starting to have this sort [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=460.09999999999997s)]
*  of much stronger cultural divide, that the cleavages are based on education, the cleavages [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=464.06s)]
*  are based on some of the social issues we're seeing, and that it really creates this sort [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=469.74s)]
*  of new divide in terms of the parties that traditionally, you know, you think about special [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=474.46s)]
*  elections, that lower turnout elections traditionally were supposed to favor Republicans, because [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=480.86s)]
*  Republican voters were traditionally more affluent, better educated, and more likely [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=486.06s)]
*  to vote in Democrats you needed to persuade. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=489.65999999999997s)]
*  As the coalitions have shifted, Democrats are performing better in midterms, performing [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=492.1s)]
*  better in special elections, because they are now more of the high-propensity voters. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=495.78000000000003s)]
*  You have the shift in voters, they're still in between. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=502.02000000000004s)]
*  There are examples in the articles of folks who are frustrated with Trump, frustrated [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=504.82000000000005s)]
*  with, you know, some of them are frustrated with Biden, and there's still sort of this [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=509.14000000000004s)]
*  spectrum to which this is not a clear conversion, that this is not an issue in which you have [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=512.86s)]
*  who have suddenly flipped on a switch because they're repelled by Trump that you have in [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=519.62s)]
*  the area I went to, a lot of people voted for Joe Biden, who voted for Raphael Warnock [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=523.3s)]
*  in the Senate race, then also voted for Republican Brian Kemp for governor in 2022. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=527.46s)]
*  And that, you know, they're looking for normal Republicans, and if they're crazy Republicans, [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=531.86s)]
*  they're going straight Democrat. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=536.98s)]
*  Yeah, this is interesting. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=538.22s)]
*  That point you made, I want to just linger on this for a moment, because it's something [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=540.38s)]
*  I'm sort of obsessed with. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=543.42s)]
*  For as long as I've covered politics, the belief is higher turnout helps Democrats, [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=544.7s)]
*  right, that Democrats have a higher percentage of sort of lower-propensity voters, that they [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=550.5400000000001s)]
*  have the harder time turning folks out, the Republicans have higher-propensity voters, [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=554.86s)]
*  the ones that show up for midterms, and that's why you got 94, and that's why you got 2010. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=559.62s)]
*  The changing nature of the coalitions is changing that, and we're seeing it in these special [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=564.7800000000001s)]
*  elections. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=569.98s)]
*  It's really interesting, because you get to this point where you're sort of, you've [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=570.98s)]
*  got an interesting tension between one's principles and what might be best. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=574.94s)]
*  So like in Pennsylvania, Josh Shapiro just introduced automatic voter registration. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=579.1s)]
*  I think that's great. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=582.98s)]
*  I support that. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=584.4s)]
*  I want people to vote, no matter which party it helps. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=585.4s)]
*  But the idea that high levels of turnout automatically help Democrats just might not be borne out [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=589.16s)]
*  anymore, and it might also make Republicans start to rethink what they've been doing in [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=595.26s)]
*  stopping people from going to the ballot box. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=599.88s)]
*  That's certainly a possibility, but it's also so much of this has become tribal, that [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=603.88s)]
*  so much of these attitudes are rooted in tribalism, that there's so much of this is about cultural [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=608.0s)]
*  signifiers, and that that's become part of this, too, that, you know, if you think about [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=612.88s)]
*  how much Donald Trump has changed politics, which is part of this, is that just about [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=616.88s)]
*  everything has been politicized. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=620.2s)]
*  What beer you drink, what sports you watch is political, and that some of this is not [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=621.64s)]
*  about sort of the broader electoral logic, but there's a symbolism there that we've [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=627.2s)]
*  seen in politics throughout, which is part of the reason why Brian Kemp won, that it [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=631.76s)]
*  wasn't that Brian Kemp was a liberal Republican. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=636.08s)]
*  No one would confuse him with the Syrian communist Nelson Rockefeller. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=638.5200000000001s)]
*  But because he broke with Trump on the elections and because of the stylistic differences, [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=642.44s)]
*  he was perceived as more moderate, and that made the difference, and that helped Republicans [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=646.74s)]
*  down the ticket, too, that all the state Republicans, that you had Trump endorsing election deniers [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=651.5200000000001s)]
*  who benefited from the same wave as you did Brad Raffensperger, who testified before the [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=655.88s)]
*  January 6 committee and won with key figures in stopping the efforts to overturn the election, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=660.12s)]
*  that it creates this branding and this cultural signifiers that's more than the policy nuances. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=664.64s)]
*  That's a really good point. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=671.48s)]
*  It's a great piece in The New Republic by Ben Jacobs. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=672.48s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WWgls9W8a3w&t=674.2s)]
