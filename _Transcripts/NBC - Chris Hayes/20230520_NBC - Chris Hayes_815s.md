# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: May 19
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 20, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Ron DeSantis' state of Florida is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=0.0s)]
*  forcing a kind of torture on its residents. That's not my conclusion. It's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=4.12s)]
*  not my word, in fact. The word comes from Florida resident Peter Rogel. He's a [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=8.68s)]
*  Catholic father of seven, a grandfather of 17, who had to watch his daughter endure [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  unimaginable horror at the hands of the state, which has banned most abortions. As [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=19.72s)]
*  Rogel told The Washington Post, quote, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=25.520000000000003s)]
*  This is what Ron DeSantis has forced upon this family. Debra and Lee [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=32.92s)]
*  Dorbert, Peter's daughter and son-in-law, learned 23 weeks into her pregnancy that [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=37.24s)]
*  their child had a condition called Potter syndrome that is incompatible with [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=42.2s)]
*  life. The baby did not develop kidneys and was suffering from a series of other [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=45.96s)]
*  abnormalities of the heart and stomach due to a lack of amniotic fluid. Potter [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=50.64s)]
*  syndrome also causes underdeveloped lungs and babies who survived to [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=55.56s)]
*  delivery are born unable to breathe. Typically, they suffocate within minutes [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=59.4s)]
*  to hours after birth. After receiving that diagnosis, Debra and Lee decided [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=64.92s)]
*  they wanted to terminate the pregnancy. Quote, [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=70.76s)]
*  But as long as there's babies, heart kept beating, doctor would not honor their [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=73.76s)]
*  request. Now, current law in Florida that bans abortions of 15 weeks does have an [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  exception for fetal, fatal abnormalities, but the doctors wouldn't say how they [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=82.92s)]
*  reached their decision. The key thing, though, here, and we've seen this in [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=90.24000000000001s)]
*  state after state that have so-called exceptions, is the law carries severe [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=92.84s)]
*  penalties, including prison time, for medical practitioners who run afoul of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=96.52000000000001s)]
*  it. So what do you think is going to happen? So the door birds weren't allowed [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=100.80000000000001s)]
*  to terminate the pregnancy. They did not have control of that decision. That [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  decision was in the hands of Ron DeSantis, and they had to wait. They had [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=109.4s)]
*  to wait three and a half months until Debra was close to full term to have [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=114.04s)]
*  labor induced. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=118.52000000000001s)]
*  We've pretty much made a plan for everything at this point known I have to [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=121.0s)]
*  carry to full term. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=125.84s)]
*  So we kind of have come to accept that. I mean, we don't have any choice but to [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=130.76000000000002s)]
*  accept those terms. It's exhausting. Just the anxiety and the depression and, you [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=138.28s)]
*  know, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=148.20000000000002s)]
*  carrying a baby and knowing what's about to happen. It's mentally, it's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=150.12s)]
*  challenging. And then just my four year old, he doesn't see the same mommy all [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=158.60000000000002s)]
*  the time because I break down crying. He's wiping my eyes and telling me it's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=166.16s)]
*  okay. So I know it's probably hard on him seeing me sad. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=171.28s)]
*  Debra recalled when she finally made it to 37 weeks that they sat down with [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=177.52s)]
*  their son who saw their cadence to explain the baby's body had stopped [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  working and that he would not come home. Instead, someday they told Kaden they [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=185.0s)]
*  would all meet as angels. The four year old burst into tears telling them he [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=189.48s)]
*  did not want to be an angel. March 3rd, after 12 hours of labor, Debra gave [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=193.36s)]
*  birth to her second son Milo. He was four pounds, 12 ounces, and he did not [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=200.6s)]
*  cry or open his eyes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=204.8s)]
*  But when they pulled the baby on out, I thought my miracle happened. I thought [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=207.28s)]
*  because the baby was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=211.44s)]
*  looked perfect for me. And then I realized once Debbie had it to me that [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=214.52s)]
*  the baby was doing hiccups. I call it hiccups. And finally I realized after [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=220.8s)]
*  about five, 10 minutes that it wasn't hiccups. It was gasping for air. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=227.0s)]
*  Milo lived for just 99 minutes. If you've got to take a second of this story, I [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=232.04000000000002s)]
*  understand because it's so devastating. Too much to handle. Just one story. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=236.8s)]
*  This is just one story. Big state, Florida, from this family that was so [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=245.32000000000002s)]
*  brave to tell it. But we know there are many others, innumerable others like it [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=250.28s)]
*  that we don't know, that we haven't heard about it. And there will be many more [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=256.08000000000004s)]
*  in Florida and in all of the states that have adopted the Republican vision of [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=259.68s)]
*  control of people's bodies and their families. They are taking away the very [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=263.56s)]
*  values they claim to uphold like freedom and choice, as Deborah Dorbert explains. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=268.96s)]
*  You say we live in the land of freedom and making choices for ourselves, but [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=275.12s)]
*  yet I can't right now. I can't make a choice [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=281.6s)]
*  for what's best for me, this baby, my family. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=287.04s)]
*  Now, we know that story thanks to some phenomenal reporting from the Washington [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=292.0s)]
*  Post, all those interviews, that footage, all from the Washington Post that told [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=295.16s)]
*  this one story of what it looks like when the Republican vision of control [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=299.20000000000005s)]
*  happens to your family in a moment of crisis. Control is now a pillar of the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  Republican vision. It does not stop at pregnancy in women's bodies. No. In [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=309.36s)]
*  Florida, public expressions of LGBTQ pride are now under threat. Today, [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=313.44s)]
*  organizers canceled a Tampa Pride event in the wake of Rhonda Sands expansion of [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=318.72s)]
*  the so-called Don't Say Gay Law. The legislation now allows the state to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=324.36s)]
*  fine, suspend or revoke the license of any establishment if the establishment [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=328.76s)]
*  admits a child to an adult live performance. Now, while the text is not [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=334.16s)]
*  specifically mentioned drag performances, a handout from the governor's news [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=338.64s)]
*  conference Wednesday stated that drag shows are considered live performances, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=342.32s)]
*  quote, without serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=346.48s)]
*  for the age of the child present, as the law describes it. Because drag queens [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=350.52000000000004s)]
*  perform in the open at the Tampa Pride Festival, well, organizers worried [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=355.8s)]
*  understandably they could be violating the new law. So no pride parade now in [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=359.68s)]
*  the free state of Florida. And this comes on the heels of the report we brought [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=365.28000000000003s)]
*  you last night about the impact of another law Rhonda Sands signed this week [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=368.96000000000004s)]
*  banning gender-referring health care for children. You don't get to choose what [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=372.52000000000004s)]
*  kind of health care your kid gets. Rhonda Sands chooses just like he chooses to [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=377.6s)]
*  keep you pregnant for 12 weeks to deliver a baby you know will die. And [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=381.92s)]
*  these laws, as gothic as they are in their effects, are what Rhonda Sands is [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=391.52000000000004s)]
*  going to run on in his soon to be officially declared presidential campaign. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=399.0s)]
*  And that is no surprise because control over your body, your self-expression, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=403.76s)]
*  gender identity, your children, your family. That's what the Republican Party [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=408.68s)]
*  has been obsessed with in the last few years, particularly all over the country [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=413.2s)]
*  in every state where they have political power. This is the priority, controlling [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=416.56s)]
*  those things. Just look where Republicans have passed bans on abortion and on [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=419.88s)]
*  gender-affirming care for minors. Do those look similar to you? Yes. They are [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=425.16s)]
*  nearly the same map and that is because they are all part of the same political [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=430.36s)]
*  project of control. The goal is to control how and when you give birth, what [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=434.68s)]
*  your family looks like, how it can love, how you and your children can express [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=439.8s)]
*  themselves. In fact, to make my point as clear as possible, just hours ago in [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=444.92s)]
*  Nebraska, lawmakers in the Republican-dominated legislature voted on a bill [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=451.68s)]
*  where they just cut to the chase and merged together two of their main goals [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=456.4s)]
*  into one bill, restricting access to abortion, a statewide abortion ban, and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=460.28s)]
*  care for transgender minors. They put it all in one deadly package, as Democratic [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=464.44s)]
*  state Senator Michaela Kavanaugh told her conservative colleagues. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=469.28s)]
*  Women will die. Children are dying. It is your fault. It is your fault. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=473.64s)]
*  And you are allowing it to happen. You do literally have blood on your hands. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=480.64s)]
*  And if you vote for this, you will have buckets and buckets of blood on your [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=486.71999999999997s)]
*  hands. That bill passed 33 to 15. The Republican governor has said that he [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=491.32s)]
*  will sign it. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=496.2s)]
*  Dozens of wildfires in western Canada are generating immense amounts of smoke [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=498.32s)]
*  that are drifting across the country into the U.S., sparking air quality [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=503.4s)]
*  alerts in parts of five U.S. states today, even there in Wisconsin. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=507.24s)]
*  Young children, the elderly, people with health conditions in those areas are [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=511.6s)]
*  being advised to stay inside. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=514.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, obviously, wildfires are a seasonal hazard, but it's May and it's in Canada. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=517.16s)]
*  And fire season there usually doesn't peak until July. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=523.44s)]
*  But of course, hotter temperatures and much longer fire seasons are part of the [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=526.8s)]
*  new climate reality. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=531.04s)]
*  Right now, the average global temperature is one degree Celsius warmer than in the [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=532.92s)]
*  late 1800s. We've warmed at one degree. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=537.6s)]
*  When I started covering climate 15 years ago, 20 years ago, a global temperature [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=540.24s)]
*  increase of 1.5 degrees Celsius degrees was viewed as the real danger threshold [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=546.64s)]
*  because anything over that was going to get real, real ugly. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=553.16s)]
*  This week, we got word from scientists that it is very likely we will hit that [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=557.04s)]
*  threshold, one and a half degrees, by 2027. [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=561.12s)]
*  So the old window of what used to be considered the outer bounds of what we can [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=565.0s)]
*  deal with, we're likely going to hit that within the next five years. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=569.0s)]
*  And of course, with one degree, we are already seeing and we are going to see [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=573.68s)]
*  more of an unfathomable amount of human misery across the globe as the destruction [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=577.68s)]
*  and economic damage from climate change forces people to flee their homes and to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=583.24s)]
*  become refugees. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=587.8s)]
*  It is the number one challenge in the world, as it has been, and it is only [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=588.96s)]
*  becoming more so. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=593.8000000000001s)]
*  A civilizational challenge, unprecedented in scale and scope. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=595.6800000000001s)]
*  And it is really striking that as we begin the official 2024 campaign with [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=599.0s)]
*  people like Tim Scott, Nikki Haley and Ron DeSantis, jumping in to challenge the [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=603.0400000000001s)]
*  ex-president for the Republican nomination, this issue, the most important [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=606.6s)]
*  one, the central civilizational challenge of our time, is utterly and completely [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=610.9200000000001s)]
*  absent and ignored from all Republican political campaign discourse. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=616.6s)]
*  I was thinking this the other day when I saw that the Glenn Youngkin, the flashy [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=621.76s)]
*  new video suggesting maybe he might be thinking about running in 2024. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=625.2s)]
*  It almost seemed like a joke, like a comedic schtick to wonder, well, what's [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=629.36s)]
*  his climate plan? [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=633.24s)]
*  Because of course it's preposterous. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=635.6s)]
*  I don't think he has one or will have one because Republicans don't care. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=638.12s)]
*  Truly do not care if we melt the earth. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=642.68s)]
*  They are either in denial or they're actively on the side of the polluters. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=645.1999999999999s)]
*  But it is actually the single most important question for anyone running for [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=649.8s)]
*  president. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=653.7199999999999s)]
*  What are you going to do to meet the targets we have to meet to decarbonize as [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=654.2399999999999s)]
*  rapidly as we have to, to have a chance of not heating the planet to two, three, [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=658.92s)]
*  four degrees Celsius? [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=664.12s)]
*  Now, in the case of the incumbent president, Joe Biden, he got the inflation [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=666.8399999999999s)]
*  reduction plan. [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=669.5999999999999s)]
*  The first ever climate legislation that we've had really, which by itself is [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=670.4s)]
*  insufficient, but so far has been successful beyond all expectations. [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=675.08s)]
*  Demands for tax credits for things like wind and solar projects and electric [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=680.48s)]
*  cars are exceeding projections or seeing real movement in the energy transition [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=684.04s)]
*  for the first time. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=689.0s)]
*  Sales of energy efficient heat pumps are now outpacing traditional fossil fuel [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=690.16s)]
*  furnaces in people's homes. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=694.8000000000001s)]
*  We may be at a point where we're going to have to get a lot of energy to get [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=696.16s)]
*  to homes. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=699.36s)]
*  We may be about to get a huge boom in the use of its hydrogen for industrial [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=699.84s)]
*  purposes, which is a game changer. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=702.96s)]
*  So that's the first part of the change, right? [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=705.8000000000001s)]
*  We need way, way more investment from where that came from, more things like [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=708.2800000000001s)]
*  the IRA. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=711.9200000000001s)]
*  But the Republican Party doesn't care or talk about that. [[00:11:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=713.96s)]
*  It just doesn't exist in their universe. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=717.48s)]
*  Instead, what they do is go to bat on behalf of the fossil fuel companies to try [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=719.4000000000001s)]
*  to destroy the energy transition. [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=724.6800000000001s)]
*  That is what they're doing right now. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=726.5200000000001s)]
*  In this fight over the debt ceiling, their demand to repeal most of the new tax [[00:12:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=728.28s)]
*  credits that make energy cheaper and cleaner and to allow more drilling for [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=732.6s)]
*  fossil fuels. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=736.16s)]
*  Those are part of the demands of the House negotiators who briefly paused debt [[00:12:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=738.16s)]
*  ceiling talks today to extract more leverage over the White House. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=742.28s)]
*  That's what they want. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=745.36s)]
*  Drill baby drill. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=746.36s)]
*  Here we are 15 years later, essentially the guiding ethos of the whole party and [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=747.4399999999999s)]
*  all the candidates. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=751.36s)]
*  And so we're just stuck in this bizarre situation. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=753.0s)]
*  The most pressing challenge in the world, the most important thing to have a position [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=755.68s)]
*  on and a plan for Republicans have succeeded in rendering completely invisible [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=761.5999999999999s)]
*  in the number one political contest in the country. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=767.4799999999999s)]
*  And I guess what I would say was I would urge fellow journalists, particularly [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=770.16s)]
*  political and campaign journalists, not to collude in that erasure. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=774.3199999999999s)]
*  Because of course, the climate doesn't care whether we talk about it. [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=779.9599999999999s)]
*  It's going to make itself known either way. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=783.28s)]
*  Just ask the folks choking on all that smoke. [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ugaO022Jzso&t=786.24s)]
