# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Dec. 21
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 22, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok)
*  Sherrilyn Ifill is the former president and director counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=0.0s)]
*  Fund and the founding director of Harvard University's new 14th Amendment Center for [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=4.72s)]
*  Law and Democracy. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=10.040000000000001s)]
*  She also informally consulted on the Colorado case, disqualified Donald Trump for the ballot, [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=11.040000000000001s)]
*  and she joins me now. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=15.56s)]
*  I don't want to make too much, Sherrilyn, of one poll that was a snap poll taken just [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=16.56s)]
*  in reaction, but in some ways I think it's instructive because it's sort of a first thought, [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=21.5s)]
*  best thought kind of thing. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=25.6s)]
*  Like, it comes down, what do you think? [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=26.6s)]
*  And I'm curious your reaction to that, saying that 54% of voters approve, 33 disapprove, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=28.72s)]
*  of a decision that I think in the mainstream discourse has been far more contentious. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=34.2s)]
*  Sherrilyn Yeah, thanks, Chris. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=38.519999999999996s)]
*  You know, of course I'm heartened that a majority of those polled said that they approved of [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=41.96s)]
*  the decision. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=46.480000000000004s)]
*  The folks that you interviewed, that your team interviewed who said, you know, it won't [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=49.120000000000005s)]
*  change my mind, it's just a setup, there's still just charges, and all the things they've [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  said about the other cases involving President Trump. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=57.24s)]
*  You know, it's very much like what people would say maybe in, you know, the neighborhood [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=61.36s)]
*  next over from me about someone who was arrested and accused of being a drug kingpin. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=66.16s)]
*  People who've seen that person in the neighborhood, who liked that person who handed out turkeys [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=73.32000000000001s)]
*  on Thanksgiving, who was a funny person and engaged with people, would say all of those [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  things. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=83.96000000000001s)]
*  I think it's good that a majority of people are hearing this and feeling like there is [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=85.91999999999999s)]
*  something there. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=93.88s)]
*  The good news about Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is that it's easy to read. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  There's really nothing confusing about the language. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=100.63999999999999s)]
*  That's my first reaction. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=104.52s)]
*  The second reaction, Chris, is I don't care. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=105.63999999999999s)]
*  We don't put questions of legality or eligibility for the ballot to polls. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=108.4s)]
*  These are the words of Section 3 of the 14th Amendment of the Constitution. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=116.12s)]
*  We don't run a poll on whether if Donald Trump said he was 34 years old or if he didn't continuously [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=120.36000000000001s)]
*  live in the United States for 14 years, which is another requirement, we don't put that [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=129.24s)]
*  to a plebiscite. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=133.68s)]
*  Those are the qualifications for those seeking this office. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=135.44s)]
*  The reason it's so important, Section 3, which comes to us after the Civil War, is that those [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=139.04s)]
*  framers, Chris, had looked insurrectionist in the eye. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=145.92s)]
*  They had faced a divided and broken country. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=149.96s)]
*  They had seen the ultimate in white supremacist ideology. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=153.16s)]
*  Section 3 was included precisely because they understood the danger of these two strains [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=157.92s)]
*  in American life to undo the possibility of the new democracy that was being created after the Civil War. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=163.92000000000002s)]
*  And I think for the last five years, so many people have been throwing up their hands saying, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=171.12s)]
*  we've never seen anything like this. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=175.12s)]
*  What can we do to stop someone like Donald Trump? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=176.72s)]
*  Yes, it's true. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=179.6s)]
*  We haven't had to deal with this since the Civil War. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=180.60000000000002s)]
*  Thank goodness, because most of our presidents, all of our presidents, save one, have not tried [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=183.04000000000002s)]
*  to overthrow the legitimate election of their successor. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=189.0s)]
*  But the framers of the 14th Amendment created tools for us to be able to deal with the possibility [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=192.76s)]
*  that there would be those who would be in this position. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=199.96s)]
*  And the simple phrase tells us that what they're saying is that if you are disloyal to the [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=202.84s)]
*  Constitution of the United States, having once taken office and taken an oath of office in the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=209.0s)]
*  past and then engaged in insurrection or rebellion, or having provided aid and comfort to those who did [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=214.68s)]
*  engage in insurrection or rebellion against the Constitution, you are ineligible for public [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=221.96s)]
*  office at either the state or the federal level. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=227.4s)]
*  It's perfectly logical. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=229.64000000000001s)]
*  It's there. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=231.28s)]
*  It was created by these framers. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=232.32s)]
*  And I think it's very easy for people to understand. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=234.52s)]
*  You know, one of the one of the things that has been a recurring theme of this era, right, is [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=238.4s)]
*  pushing is that Trump pushes against every boundary around him and sees how far he can go. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=243.04000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=250.56s)]
*  And one of the things I thought about actually in the wake of this, and this has been occasioned by [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=251.16s)]
*  a few people making this point, it is interesting, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=254.68s)]
*  We talk about the 34-year-old or someone who is not a U.S. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=257.68s)]
*  citizen or not a natural born citizen, right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=261.76s)]
*  Like, clearly, like you can't you couldn't put a 20-year-old on the ballot for president, right? [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=263.32s)]
*  We all understand that. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=267.52s)]
*  And the thought I had was as you watch this sort of interesting, granular question of like, oh, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=268.24s)]
*  well, how does this actually work? [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=272.96s)]
*  Right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=274.24s)]
*  State by state and in Maine, the secretary of state is going to decide and in Colorado, the voters [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=274.48s)]
*  can sue. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=278.4s)]
*  And I had the thought of, well, what if someone, Donald Trump, for instance, wanted to seek a third [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=278.79999999999995s)]
*  term? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=284.08s)]
*  Clearly, the Constitution says he can't. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=285.35999999999996s)]
*  And clearly, you could say, well, it would be anti-democratic to not have him on the ballot. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=289.0s)]
*  I mean, the people should decide. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=293.56s)]
*  But no, actually, in the Constitution, right, in the Constitution, we're just sorry, we're just clear [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=294.4s)]
*  about that. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=300.2s)]
*  But then the question becomes like, right, when the rubber hits the road, if a certain person says [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=300.64s)]
*  I'm running for a third term, it turns out it's just going to be a test of the same sets of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=304.59999999999997s)]
*  institutions and laws, right? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=308.24s)]
*  That whether they can say no, you can't. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=310.0s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=313.08s)]
*  And this decision by the Colorado Supreme Court is incredibly thorough, goes through all the [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=313.64s)]
*  evidence. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=318.40000000000003s)]
*  This is a court that understands what the stakes are. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=318.8s)]
*  It will head to the Supreme Court. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=321.96000000000004s)]
*  And as I've said in the past, this is really going to be a test for the Supreme Court because the [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=323.8s)]
*  plain text of section three of the 14th Amendment is very clear. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=329.52s)]
*  The findings of the trial court and the affirmation by the Colorado Supreme Court are very clear and [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=333.8s)]
*  well-founded. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=339.64s)]
*  The dissenters in the Colorado Supreme Court case dissent on grounds that have to do with Colorado [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=340.84s)]
*  state law. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=346.32s)]
*  And for your viewers who don't know, a state's highest court is the last word on the interpretation [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=347.36s)]
*  of that state's local laws, that state's laws. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=354.32s)]
*  So the Supreme Court's not really in a position to overturn on the grounds that the dissenters in the [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=357.92s)]
*  case dissented. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=364.76s)]
*  So this is going to be a real test for them. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=366.04s)]
*  There are people who suggested that we're naive to think that they will do the right thing and [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=368.8s)]
*  uphold this. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=373.24s)]
*  That's not really why we file cases. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=374.6s)]
*  I'm a civil rights lawyer. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=376.32s)]
*  I don't file a case thinking the Supreme Court's definitely going to rule my way. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=377.32s)]
*  You file a case because you have a legal claim that must be vindicated. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=381.04s)]
*  And this is critically important. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=386.16s)]
*  We so often ignore the 14th Amendment when it is central to our ability to create a healthy [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=389.24s)]
*  democracy. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=395.76s)]
*  And at our peril, we have ignored sections of it. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=396.44s)]
*  We have distorted it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=399.44s)]
*  We have upended it. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=400.64s)]
*  We have used it for ends that it was not meant for. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=401.72s)]
*  But this section of the 14th Amendment was meant precisely for the occasion in which we would [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=405.28000000000003s)]
*  find ourselves now. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=410.56s)]
*  And by the way, it doesn't just apply to Donald Trump. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=412.16s)]
*  So I hope that all those other insurrectionists who are holding office or planning to run for [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=414.52s)]
*  reelection, I hope they're sleeping a little more fitfully after this Colorado Supreme [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=420.59999999999997s)]
*  Court ruling because it's not over. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=425.91999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, and I should I should note here, Judge Michael Ludig, who has has become a very vocal [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=428.47999999999996s)]
*  Trump critic and was a sort of legendary conservative and real conservative jurist. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=433.0s)]
*  He was set on the Federal Appeals Court before he left. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=438.28s)]
*  He was in the in the shortlist to be a Supreme Court justice. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=441.04s)]
*  You know, he says that he said it's the opposite of politics is ruling that the Constitution [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=444.84000000000003s)]
*  itself tells us that disqualification of the former president is not anti-democratic. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=449.68s)]
*  Rather, it tells us is the conduct that gave rise to disqualification under the 14th that is [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=453.64000000000004s)]
*  anti-democratic. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=458.68s)]
*  Final question for you is on is on the second point here about the sort of necessity of [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=459.88s)]
*  there's the 14th Amendment, Section 3, and then there's also will the legal system be [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=465.32000000000005s)]
*  allowed to run its course and have a full and a full trial before a jury with full [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=470.04s)]
*  constitutional rights in due process of this man in times that people can judge who they [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=475.40000000000003s)]
*  are voting for? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=482.32000000000005s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=483.64000000000004s)]
*  So I want to separate this out because there are so many cases. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=484.32000000000005s)]
*  You know, you're right. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=487.16s)]
*  There is the criminal case. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=488.12s)]
*  We have Jack Smith's case. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=490.68s)]
*  We also have the LDF KKK case that got a huge boost today with the finding of the [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=493.36s)]
*  telephone phone calls with Trump and Wayne County canvassers in 2020. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=500.24s)]
*  And so we've got a lot of different things going on that need to move through the system. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=506.2s)]
*  But, you know, this is still a test for the Supreme Court because they're going to have to [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=509.84s)]
*  make a decision about the very question that you're asking me. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=513.4s)]
*  They have to ask themselves in a democratic system, don't the voters have the right to know [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=516.44s)]
*  whether this person is in fact guilty of the crimes of which he's accused or not before they [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=521.12s)]
*  vote in that election? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=526.4s)]
*  Now, the Supreme Court can engage in sleight of hand. [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=527.84s)]
*  I mean, I could imagine them trying to resuscitate that Purcell doctrine that says we [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=530.24s)]
*  don't change things about an election too close to an election. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=534.88s)]
*  I mean, it would be outrageous to take a shadow docket decision and use it in this way. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=537.6800000000001s)]
*  But it would not. I would not put it past them. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=542.24s)]
*  They may say on the Section 3 case that there needs to be enabling legislation by Congress to [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=544.52s)]
*  remove someone from the ballot. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=550.24s)]
*  I mean, there are a million ways I think they will try to avoid this, because, Chris, there is no [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=551.5600000000001s)]
*  way looking at the text, at the history, at the intention of the provision, at the trial [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=555.8399999999999s)]
*  court record, at the decision of the Colorado Supreme Court that just on the legality, not on [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=561.92s)]
*  the politics, just on the legality, you could strike down that decision. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=567.56s)]
*  So that's the Colorado Supreme Court decision. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=572.3599999999999s)]
*  The other cases are those criminal cases that need to move. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=574.52s)]
*  Jack Smith is trying to move to directly to the Supreme Court. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=578.28s)]
*  I can't think of a rational or even legal reason why they would not accept that expeditious [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=582.48s)]
*  hearing and turn it back to the Court of Appeals. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=588.5600000000001s)]
*  And so I think the Supreme Court is in a tough spot. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=592.0s)]
*  Of course, they're the 800-pound gorilla. [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=594.8000000000001s)]
*  They get to do whatever they want. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=596.44s)]
*  But every time they depart from what is plainly the correct legal course by the rules that they [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=598.12s)]
*  have created and upheld, every time they depart from that, they further undercut their [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=604.2s)]
*  legitimacy and they lay the groundwork for the changes that will happen to the structure of the [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=609.0799999999999s)]
*  Supreme Court in the coming years. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=616.0799999999999s)]
*  I'm sure those changes will happen, but they will happen more readily and with more public [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=617.4399999999999s)]
*  support, the more the court is perceived as departing from its own standards and from [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=621.4s)]
*  standards of legitimacy. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=627.68s)]
*  Sherrilyn, I feel always a great, great pleasure to have you. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=630.24s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=632.7199999999999s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=633.76s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani's bankruptcy filing includes lists of creditors. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=634.44s)]
*  He owes over one hundred and fifty million dollars. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=639.72s)]
*  And as Daily Beast reporter Roger Sollenberger points out, these lists are like a road map to [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=641.8000000000001s)]
*  the downfall of the man once known as America's mayor. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=646.1600000000001s)]
*  One of the people on the list, for instance, is attorney Robert Costello's firm. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=649.6800000000001s)]
*  Now, Costello represented Giuliani in a whole bunch of things, from the federal investigation into [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=652.84s)]
*  his business dealings in Ukraine, to the FBI raid on his home and office, to the January 6 [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=657.6400000000001s)]
*  Committee's investigation into the insurrection, to disciplinary proceedings that could lead to [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=662.08s)]
*  his disbarment for helping Trump try to steal the election. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=666.64s)]
*  And the criminal case against Giuliani in Georgia, where he is now indicted on 13 felony [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=670.32s)]
*  charges. Now, according to the filing, Costello's firm, Davidoff, Hutcher and Citron, is [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=674.2800000000001s)]
*  claiming they are owed over one point three million dollars, an amount that Giuliani [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=680.2s)]
*  disputes. But that amount pales in comparison to the one hundred and forty six million dollars a [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=684.32s)]
*  judge ordered Giuliani to pay former Georgia election workers Rumi Freeman and Shea Moss for [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=689.56s)]
*  defamation. Roger Sollenberger is a senior political reporter for Daily Beast. [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=695.0s)]
*  He's been reporting on Giuliani for years and he's been poring through this filing all day. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=699.0s)]
*  Roger, I've been following your reporting. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=703.2399999999999s)]
*  So just first sort of take a throw through what you gleaned from this bankruptcy filing the federal [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=704.68s)]
*  court today. Yeah, I mean, the most fascinating thing to me, like you're saying, is this road map. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=709.4399999999999s)]
*  Like very rarely do you get to see a look at someone's personal downfall laid out so neatly [[00:11:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=716.84s)]
*  before you. Right. The list of creditors is really the like the road map or just the story, a path [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=724.2800000000001s)]
*  through the last four years or so of Rudy Giuliani's precipitous public decline, which we have seen. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=730.6s)]
*  And because he's been such a character and has been through so many events in that time, you tend [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=736.6s)]
*  to forget, you know, just how many things have happened. [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=743.64s)]
*  And yeah, this this finally takes you through that. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=748.28s)]
*  There's an accounting firm from his 2019 divorce proceedings that is suing him, just sued him in [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=752.1999999999999s)]
*  November, I think, for ten thousand dollars. They just seen the writing on the wall. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=760.04s)]
*  There's a lawsuit from a former assistant that is suing him for like pretty revolting claims of [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=765.0s)]
*  sexual harassment. I don't know if we remember those. There are two law firms that are suing [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=771.88s)]
*  him for fees that wrote him. One of them is or at least was representing him in Georgia for free. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=777.88s)]
*  But they are also claiming back fees. There's Costello's firm claim back fees. There's the IRS. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=783.32s)]
*  There's the New York State Department of Taxation that is claiming from him. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=788.52s)]
*  It's really a, you know, looking at as a portrait of a man. It's not not so flattering. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=793.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, one of the things that the Times noted, of course, too, just in terms of this, [[00:13:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=799.5600000000001s)]
*  like, you know, the sort of epic downfall, just as almost Greek mythic sort of trajectory of this [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=803.16s)]
*  individual who, to my mind, has for much of his career displayed precisely the same attributes [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=809.0s)]
*  consistently. But I should note that he really lived a lavish life. He made millions of dollars [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=815.0s)]
*  a year in his private law practice after he left public office. He had this consulting firm that [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=821.08s)]
*  was enormously lucrative after 9 11. His divorce from his third wife exposed the couple's once [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=826.12s)]
*  lavish lifestyle, a $230,000 a month spending habit, six houses, 11 country club memberships. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=831.48s)]
*  Now, he says he's broke. He's filed for bankruptcy. He owes all these people money. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=838.12s)]
*  I guess the question is, given the judge saying she doesn't trust he's not hiding assets, like, [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=843.88s)]
*  what do we know about how much this is an actual full display of his actual finances? If there's [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=848.92s)]
*  some secret money squirreled away somewhere or there isn't? I mean, we don't really quite know. [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=854.68s)]
*  We can take him at his word. Some assets that I don't think have been listed are four World Series [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=862.04s)]
*  rings that he got when he was mayor that are diamond encrusted and valued. I have to think [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=869.2399999999999s)]
*  about $200,000 back in 2007. They've got his name on them. I don't know if those lawyers are aware [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=873.88s)]
*  if they've existed or if those things might be in hock somewhere, but those are assets. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=879.4s)]
*  He does have money. His ex-wife, when she was serving him in this divorce proceeding, [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=886.1999999999999s)]
*  was alleging that he was concealing his money and that he was doing so, by the way, [[00:14:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=892.36s)]
*  through his relationship with Trump. It was through that 2018-2019 mess in Ukraine where [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=897.72s)]
*  Rudy really needed money. He was spending a lot of it, allegedly, to keep it from his wife. [[00:15:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=906.12s)]
*  The filing also tells this story of spite of him. It reveals his character in that way, too. But [[00:15:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=913.0s)]
*  again, working for Trump for free, by the way, to get him impeached the first time, [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=919.96s)]
*  working for him again in 2020, and then trying to charge him not getting paid, getting him impeached [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=925.64s)]
*  second time, going hat in hand to Donald Trump this past year. I'm not really sure [[00:15:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=932.28s)]
*  if he has swirled away money somewhere to make that speculation. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=939.24s)]
*  I think one tell is that he has not been paying his bills. I don't think that somebody would. [[00:15:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=947.48s)]
*  His lawyer, like you were pointing out, Robert Costello, a longtime friend of Rudy Giuliani, [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=955.64s)]
*  that law firm is suing him for $1.4 million. Is he actually really stiffing his friend on this money [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=960.4399999999999s)]
*  to keep something somewhere away from other creditors that he really hates and really doesn't [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=967.96s)]
*  want to have his money? Who's to say? Yeah, I think the Occam's razor here is he's broke. [[00:16:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=973.3199999999999s)]
*  We should just note, and you note this in the piece, that the actual damage he did to [[00:16:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=982.52s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and Seamus' lives is remarkable and acute and lasting. It's why the jury found [[00:16:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=987.96s)]
*  in their favor, and one hopes that they do see some actual restitution, whatever comes out of [[00:16:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=997.1600000000001s)]
*  this process. It remains to be seen whether that will happen, but that remains my hope. [[00:16:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=1004.2s)]
*  Roger Sollenberger, who's done great reporting on this throughout, thank you very much. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=1008.76s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=drZrL3Rwlok&t=1017.96s)]
