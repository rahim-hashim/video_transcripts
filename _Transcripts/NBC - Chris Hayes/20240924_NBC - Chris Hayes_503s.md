# Nebraska Republican who blocked MAGA bid to give Trump extra vote speaks out
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4)
*  Last week, Nebraska Republicans moved to change their electoral vote rules to favor Trump. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=0.0s)]
*  And once again, once the behind-the-scenes move became public, Graham openly admitted [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=6.0s)]
*  what he was doing, tried to launder it as normal politics. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=10.38s)]
*  Nebraska has been talking about this for years. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  It is a very close election. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=16.84s)]
*  The entire federal delegation of Nebraska, House members and two senators, want this [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=18.48s)]
*  change. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=24.28s)]
*  To my friends in Nebraska, that one electoral vote could be the difference between Harris [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=25.28s)]
*  being president or not, and she's a disaster for Nebraska and the world. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=29.56s)]
*  Side note, you see how the electoral college is a Rube Goldberg machine that basically [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=34.4s)]
*  just invites this kind of anti-democratic sabotage? [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=37.76s)]
*  Like what are we doing here? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=40.72s)]
*  Why do we have these rules? [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=41.92s)]
*  Count all the votes. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=42.92s)]
*  The person with most votes should win, like every other election in America, except president. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=43.92s)]
*  That said, Republicans would rather cheat than actually win. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=49.239999999999995s)]
*  We saw this time and time again in 2020, when Trump and his errand boy, Lindsey Graham, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=52.519999999999996s)]
*  and the rest of the MAGA world pressured Raffensperger, the Republican secretary of state, to change [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=57.160000000000004s)]
*  votes in Georgia after they'd been cast, when they pushed Arizona's Republican House speaker, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=60.96s)]
*  Rusty Bowers, to appoint an alternate slate of fake Trump electors. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=65.24s)]
*  In both those cases, America's future hung in the balance. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=70.56s)]
*  Trump's attacks on democracy only failed because the courage and integrity of individual Republicans, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=74.36s)]
*  like Brad Raffensperger in Georgia and Rusty Bowers in Arizona, resisting the pressure [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=81.18s)]
*  rigged the system. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=85.12s)]
*  And now that appears to be exactly what's happening in Nebraska. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=86.12s)]
*  You see, in order to hold a special session to change your electoral vote rules, Nebraska [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=89.44000000000001s)]
*  Republicans need a filibuster-proof 33-vote majority. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=94.08000000000001s)]
*  One single Republican senator could block that plan, and one didn't. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=98.2s)]
*  His name is Senator Mike McDonald. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=102.30000000000001s)]
*  He's a former Democrat who announced publicly yesterday he was a no vote on the change. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=104.64000000000001s)]
*  If you look at my position, it's been no. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=110.88s)]
*  And I made it clear for the reasons is, I believe it makes Omaha relevant in a presidential [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=112.83999999999999s)]
*  election. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=117.0s)]
*  It brings dollars into our city. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=118.0s)]
*  We're talking about potentially a $50 million economic impact this round. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=119.55999999999999s)]
*  And also, it makes you got to work for it. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=125.03999999999999s)]
*  You got to work for our vote. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=126.35999999999999s)]
*  Last point is the biggest one, seems to me. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=128.68s)]
*  You got to work for a vote. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=130.07999999999998s)]
*  I mean, Trump won that Omaha district in 2016. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  It's not, like, completely out of reach. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=133.95999999999998s)]
*  He could win it again if he focused on getting out the vote. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=135.35999999999999s)]
*  But remember what he keeps telling his supporters and his campaign workers, I don't need votes. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=137.88s)]
*  I need to watch the vote. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=141.92s)]
*  Because ultimately, Donald Trump would rather cheat than win. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=143.76s)]
*  Nebraska Republican State Senator Mike McDonald, the man of the hour, joins me now. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=147.84s)]
*  State Senator, it's wonderful having you on the program. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=152.6s)]
*  Thanks for making some time for us tonight. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  Good evening. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=156.51999999999998s)]
*  Thanks for the invitation. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=158.04s)]
*  I wondered if just a sort of informational start, if from your perspective you could [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=159.04s)]
*  guide us through what the conversations in the statehouse and in that Republican caucus [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=164.28s)]
*  have been like through this year, going back to April when it first surfaced as an idea, [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=169.24s)]
*  then it seemed to kind of go away and then made a sudden comeback last week. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=174.36s)]
*  I'd like to start, you know, thanking all the people that have reached out to me on both [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=179.12s)]
*  sides. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=183.84s)]
*  And 90% of them have been professional and polite, you know, of course, passionate. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=184.84s)]
*  And then you'll say you can't manufacture passion. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=188.48s)]
*  It's got to come from the heart, which I understand. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=190.88s)]
*  This is a serious issue and a serious decision. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=192.6s)]
*  And but I do appreciate all of the thousands of emails and conversations. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=196.0s)]
*  And going back to 2016, when I decided to run for the legislature and we're the only [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=201.36s)]
*  one house system in the country, which I think we do that better. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=206.36s)]
*  And most states should probably look at changing over to the one house system. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=209.68s)]
*  But I said, the reason I want to keep the system we have and not go to winner take all, [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=213.12s)]
*  which was changed in 1991, was the idea that it makes Omaha relevant. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=218.48s)]
*  That's where the second congressional district is. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=222.67999999999998s)]
*  And it makes the dollars, of course, the economic impact. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=224.56s)]
*  But it makes people work for our vote. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=228.48s)]
*  Come on in and talk to us and work for our vote. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=230.12s)]
*  And I think sometimes people say, oh, Nebraska, nice. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=232.83999999999997s)]
*  And they think that that's a sign of weakness. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=235.48s)]
*  It's not. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=237.07999999999998s)]
*  We work hard and we play by the rules. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=238.07999999999998s)]
*  So come on in, work hard, play by the rules. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=239.95999999999998s)]
*  Don't try to change them. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  You know, with 42 days left to try to change the rules that have been in place since 1991. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=244.12s)]
*  And as you said earlier, you know, look at the past. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=249.16s)]
*  Look at, you know, the idea of President Biden in 20, President Trump in 16. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=251.92s)]
*  You know, work for that vote and you can win it. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=258.24s)]
*  But you got to come in and work and you got to talk to us. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=260.64s)]
*  It seems to me that if here's how here's my feeling about this. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=264.0s)]
*  And I'm curious what you think, right? [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=268.0s)]
*  If you went to winner take all, say in 2023, or you had a referendum, a statewide referendum, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=270.4s)]
*  or even earlier this year, I would say, yeah, that's political hardball by Republicans, [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=276.32s)]
*  but it's OK. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  It's hardball. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=283.28s)]
*  Forty three days before the election after Maine has already passed the window, seems [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=284.28s)]
*  like something seems like not not on the up and up. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=290.92s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=295.28s)]
*  No, I've talked about this and other senators have talked about it since 17 when I was elected. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=296.28s)]
*  Let's do it in midterm. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=302.5s)]
*  Let's do ahead and go ahead and let the people of Nebraska vote, which I would oppose this, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=304.12s)]
*  my vote on this, to switch to winner take all. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=308.64000000000004s)]
*  If the people of Nebraska want to do it two years out and let whoever wants to run for [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=311.68s)]
*  president United States know the rules, I think that would be fair. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=316.22s)]
*  I still think we should keep winner take all. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=319.24s)]
*  And I think we should go around the country and like Maine, ask the other parts of the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=321.24s)]
*  country, look at our system. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=325.68s)]
*  All 435 congressional districts should look at the way we're doing things, because I think [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  you're talking about going to the people and you're not talking about 33 senators make [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=332.23999999999995s)]
*  a decision. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=336.76s)]
*  And I've compared it and I know this isn't a game and I know a football game is not very [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=337.76s)]
*  important. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=341.59999999999997s)]
*  But the idea that also the coach calls a timeout with two minutes left and says, I want to [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=342.59999999999997s)]
*  change the value of the field goal from three points to four. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=346.67999999999995s)]
*  And that's how I'm going to win. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=350.03999999999996s)]
*  That's just that's it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=351.03999999999996s)]
*  This doesn't it doesn't ring true. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=352.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's not part of Nebraska values. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=353.71999999999997s)]
*  We want to let the people make the decision. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=355.84s)]
*  And to President Trump and Vice President Harris, come into Omaha, come in and debate, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=358.36s)]
*  have a debate in Omaha. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=363.72s)]
*  Again, work for that vote and work for that that win as others have had done in the past, [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=365.12s)]
*  including President Trump and President Biden. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=371.08s)]
*  Have you received any communication from ex-President Trump directly? [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=374.2s)]
*  Has he attempted to talk to you about this? [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=378.92s)]
*  Well, my my policy for the last eight years, I don't talk about private conversations. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=382.04s)]
*  I can say that people have reached out again through phone calls and emails and in both [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=386.12s)]
*  sides really have worked hard. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=391.8s)]
*  But they've been 90 percent, you know, people, professional and polite. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=394.4s)]
*  And I'd say both campaigns, you know, were 100 percent professional and polite. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=398.16s)]
*  And then we had good conversations. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=401.84000000000003s)]
*  And I always try to tell people, you know, tell me why I'm wrong, you know, tell me why [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=403.96s)]
*  you're a yes. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BawBsRyYux4&t=408.48s)]
