Video Description: Trump “is running on jacking up prices on a huge amount of the goods we use every day. I know it sounds like I'm making this up. But genuinely his core economic policy proposal right now is an across-the-board, consumer sales tax for every good imported into the United States,” says Chris Hayes on Trump's tariff plan.

# MAGA sales tax: The Trump plan to make everything more expensive
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg)
*  There's one thing that truly unites all Americans. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=0.0s)]
*  It's that everyone hates paying more for stuff. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=2.72s)]
*  That is why when inflation sent the price of [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=5.16s)]
*  everyday goods soaring in the wake of the pandemic, [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=7.4s)]
*  you saw it reflected in poll after poll after poll. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=9.92s)]
*  People's view of the economy plummeted. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=12.36s)]
*  So did their approval of the president. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=15.4s)]
*  In fact, this happened basically across the Western world. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=17.56s)]
*  It was everyone's first taste of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=21.240000000000002s)]
*  real sharp inflation in a generation. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=23.8s)]
*  Guess what? People really hated it, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=26.8s)]
*  which is of course completely understandable because, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=29.22s)]
*  well, it really sucked. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=31.9s)]
*  In 2020, your average family of four paid [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=33.86s)]
*  about $927 a month for groceries. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=36.54s)]
*  At the height of inflation in 2022, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=40.16s)]
*  the average was $1,307 a month. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=42.379999999999995s)]
*  That's $400 more on. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=45.46s)]
*  Now, that has started to come down actually in real terms. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=47.620000000000005s)]
*  The average at the end of last year was around $1,261, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=50.480000000000004s)]
*  but again, still up from 2020. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=53.82s)]
*  The experience of paying more and more and feeling [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=56.06s)]
*  like prices are out of control and feeling squeezed, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=58.98s)]
*  translates to disaffection. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=61.54s)]
*  That disaffection is probably the single biggest advantage you [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=63.779999999999994s)]
*  can have as say the challenger to [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=67.62s)]
*  an incumbent president operating in a world in which prices have gone. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=70.82s)]
*  Yet, the Republican challenger, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=74.66s)]
*  President Biden, isn't running on lowering prices. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=77.78s)]
*  He's actually running on jacking up prices on [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=81.5s)]
*  a huge amount of the goods we use every day. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=84.3s)]
*  I know it sounds like I'm making this up, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=86.54s)]
*  but genuinely, and I want to be clear here, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=88.9s)]
*  his core economic policy proposal right now is an across the board [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=91.82000000000001s)]
*  consumer sales tax for every single good imported into the United States. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=96.38s)]
*  Now, he may call it a tariff, [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=102.26s)]
*  but it will just be passed along to consumers in [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=103.62s)]
*  a sales tax on every single good that is imported. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=106.22s)]
*  Again, you do not need to take my word for it. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=109.22s)]
*  Just listen to Donald Trump himself. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=111.66s)]
*  Number one, I think we should have a ring around the collar, as they say. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=115.06s)]
*  I think when companies come in and they dump their products in the United States, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=119.54s)]
*  they should pay automatically, let's say a 10 percent tax. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  I'm a big believer in tariffs for two reasons. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=127.22s)]
*  Number one, I fully believe in them economically [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=129.46s)]
*  when you're being taken advantage of by other countries. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=132.58s)]
*  I would say to China, if you're building a plant on our border [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=135.22s)]
*  to build cars in Mexico and to sell them into the United States, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=139.82s)]
*  I'm putting a 50 percent tariff on all those cars. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=143.57999999999998s)]
*  You use tariffs and sanctions against China. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=146.29999999999998s)]
*  I did, and I did very well with it. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=149.17999999999998s)]
*  As you know, we took in hundreds of billions of dollars in taxes [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=150.73999999999998s)]
*  through the tariffs, taxes and tariffs. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=153.62s)]
*  Is that what you want to do again? [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=155.38s)]
*  We have to do it. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=157.45999999999998s)]
*  OK, if you are a single issue inflation voter, [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=159.18s)]
*  there is only one candidate who wants to put a 10 percent tax [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=161.94s)]
*  that will be passed along to consumers as a sales tax [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=166.29999999999998s)]
*  on every single good that's imported. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=169.29999999999998s)]
*  And here's the thing, this is not a hypothetical. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=172.38s)]
*  Trump did a miniature version of this the last time he was president [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=174.46s)]
*  when he put tariffs on different Chinese goods. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=177.66s)]
*  Here's how that worked out. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=179.85999999999999s)]
*  According to analysis by the New York Fed, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=181.29999999999998s)]
*  the average import tariff rate more than doubled in 2018 alone. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=183.42s)]
*  It tangibly led to higher domestic consumer prices. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=186.9s)]
*  Take the first two tariffs on washing machines and steel. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=190.14s)]
*  Economists found that consumer prices for washing machines, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=194.01999999999998s)]
*  which have been going down steadily since 2012, [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=197.06s)]
*  almost immediately jumped back up after Trump's tariffs. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=199.34s)]
*  In fact, the New York Times found that the washer-specific tariffs [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=203.22s)]
*  raised costs for importers like LG and Samsung. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=205.82000000000002s)]
*  The steel import tariffs raised costs for some domestic manufacturers [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=209.22s)]
*  like Whirlpool pushing prices up for consumers. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=212.42000000000002s)]
*  Now Trump wants to do it again, but bigger. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=216.3s)]
*  OK, now you can argue this is going to, in the long run, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=218.78s)]
*  help American manufacturing. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  There's some argument on the other side of it. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=223.94s)]
*  But in the short term, like what's going to happen [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=225.54000000000002s)]
*  is the prices are going to go up. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=227.98s)]
*  The Democratic Alliance Center for American Progress [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=229.94s)]
*  found that Trump's proposed new tariffs would cost typical [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=231.85999999999999s)]
*  households an extra $1,500 per year. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=234.85999999999999s)]
*  Here's what that might look like. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=239.06s)]
*  Trump is proposing a 10% tariff. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=240.29999999999998s)]
*  If that 10% gets passed on to consumers, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=242.17999999999998s)]
*  which is generally how it works, things will cost more. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=244.29999999999998s)]
*  Now we don't know exactly how much everything would cost, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=247.22s)]
*  but you just add 10% on the back of the napkin, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=249.29999999999998s)]
*  here's the cost of living under the Trump tax. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=251.73999999999998s)]
*  Start with groceries, which has been the site of a lot of angst, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=255.14s)]
*  A dozen egg costs about $3. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=259.7s)]
*  Once you apply the Trump tax, that goes up to $3.30. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=261.82s)]
*  And with the US importing more than 4 million eggs a year, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=264.78s)]
*  that could cost American consumers over $1.2 million. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=266.97999999999996s)]
*  If you like oranges, those currently go for about $1.53 per pound. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=271.09999999999997s)]
*  With the 10% Trump tax, it would be $1.68 per pound, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=274.94s)]
*  which would cost American consumers almost $71 million [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=278.26s)]
*  for the nearly half a billion pounds that we import. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=281.98s)]
*  Or how about bananas? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=285.14s)]
*  We don't really grow them in the US, do we? [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=286.3s)]
*  They average about 63 cents per pound, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=288.34s)]
*  going up to 69 per cents per pound with the Trump tax. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=290.42s)]
*  And thanks to the US importing more than 10 billion [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=293.5s)]
*  with a B pounds per year, that could cost Americans $609 million. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=295.98s)]
*  That's a $609 million tax on American consumers. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=301.02s)]
*  Then there's tomatoes. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=306.06s)]
*  They go for about $213 per pound. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=307.38s)]
*  Apply a 10% Trump tax. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=309.46s)]
*  They would be $234 per pound, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=311.18s)]
*  potentially costing Americans $3.5 million [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=313.14s)]
*  thanks to the 16.5 million pounds we import per year. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=315.74s)]
*  The point is, if you are spending $1,200 a month on groceries, [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=319.86s)]
*  add another $120 to the bill. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=322.94s)]
*  That's more than even the peak of inflation in 2022, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=325.34000000000003s)]
*  which topped off at 9%. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=328.38s)]
*  This is 10%, okay? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=330.06s)]
*  And it's not just groceries. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=331.78000000000003s)]
*  How about the refrigerator? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=333.66s)]
*  You need to keep those groceries fresh. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=334.98s)]
*  Right now, the average cost of a new fridge is about $1,300. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=336.58s)]
*  With the Trump tax, that could go up to $1,430, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=340.3s)]
*  costing Americans $1.95 billion [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=343.58s)]
*  for the 15 million refrigerators that we import. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=347.38s)]
*  Again, that's a $1.95 billion in new taxes. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=350.18s)]
*  What about the car? [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=354.06s)]
*  You need to drive to the grocery store. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=354.98s)]
*  On average, a new car costs about $48,808 today. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=357.1s)]
*  With the Trump tax, it could cost $53,684, [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=361.86s)]
*  with Americans potentially taking a $66.3 billion hit [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r8MQBNbfkQg&t=366.41999999999996s)]
