# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Feb. 6
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 07, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0)
*  I'm joined now by Rachel Maddow, host of the Rachel Maddow Show, and Lawrence O'Donnell, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=0.0s)]
*  host of The Last Word. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=5.4s)]
*  All right, let me get first sort of top line reactions from you, Rachel, to the court's [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  decision today. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=10.88s)]
*  Well, first of all, just kudos on Fakakta nonsense at the end of the A block. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=11.88s)]
*  It was just, I aspire to end up there at the end of a monologue, an explanatory one like [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=17.32s)]
*  this. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=23.48s)]
*  I think, Chris, that the thing that was interesting to me about this ruling was that from the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=25.080000000000002s)]
*  very beginning, you're right that there is complicated jurisdictional stuff, there's [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=30.64s)]
*  stuff that lawyers will get that other people won't get in here. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=34.96s)]
*  But from the very beginning, it was very blunt on stuff that there's been an effort to be [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=37.6s)]
*  fuzzy about by people in the political arena. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=42.400000000000006s)]
*  It says at the very outset of the ruling, there was not a peaceful transition of power. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=44.8s)]
*  The reason the Congress was attacked, that resulted from Trump's rally, from which thousands [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=49.72s)]
*  of people then marched to the Capitol and attacked Congress. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=56.76s)]
*  It's very blunt about those things. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=59.76s)]
*  It calls it an unprecedented assault on our system of government. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=61.2s)]
*  Just very blunt about these things that there have been efforts to obfuscate, and I thought [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=65.28s)]
*  that was helpful. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=69.64s)]
*  But I also just thought it was helpful, I think, for us as a country in talking about [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=70.64s)]
*  this, that they did outright mock the claims that you have to be impeached and convicted [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=76.48s)]
*  in the Senate before you could be put on trial for committing murder or committing any of [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=82.84s)]
*  these other crimes. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=87.56s)]
*  And I think that it's good that they basically rebutted what I think of as the common sense [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=89.92s)]
*  claim here, which is that other presidents like Richard Nixon, like even Bill Clinton, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=94.8s)]
*  like other presidents in their real lives have shown, even Trump in his presidency has [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=99.68s)]
*  and has articulated that they knew they could be put on trial after they were out of office. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=105.91999999999999s)]
*  They've all known it. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=110.32s)]
*  It's a common sense thing that many presidents have conceded, including Trump himself while [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=111.32s)]
*  he was being impeached. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=116.11999999999999s)]
*  And those things, I think, they just operate in the public sphere as well as they operate [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=117.91999999999999s)]
*  in the law. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=123.08s)]
*  And we really need that. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=124.08s)]
*  We need that from the judiciary right now so people really understand what's going on [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=125.08s)]
*  here. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=128.04s)]
*  Yeah, there's two places in particular they make those citations. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=129.04s)]
*  So the Nixon-Ford example, which I think is the most famous to all of us, like it was [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=131.04s)]
*  the biggest story in the country at the time that Ford was prospectively pardoning Richard [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=135.44s)]
*  Nixon. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=139.32s)]
*  And literally everyone in the country understood that the reason he was doing that and the [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=140.32s)]
*  reason Nixon was accepting it is because he was probably going to be indicted and face [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=143.16s)]
*  criminal prosecution. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=146.23999999999998s)]
*  But there's also Bill Clinton cutting a deal on his way out the door of the White House [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=147.44s)]
*  to basically have his law license suspended in exchange basically for not being prosecuted, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=151.16s)]
*  another point at which clearly he thought it was possible. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=157.76s)]
*  And then, Rachel, your point, they also cite Trump's own lawyers at his impeachment trial, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=161.64s)]
*  which I thought was interesting, whether that was going to make him the opinion saying, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=166.07999999999998s)]
*  this doesn't say you can't go indict the guy. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=170.56s)]
*  I mean, literally his other lawyers, different lawyers, say that. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=172.92s)]
*  So yeah, all three of those examples, which I think are sort of common sense historical [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=176.2s)]
*  examples rather than arcane legal ones, are in the opinion very persuasive. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=180.04s)]
*  Lawrence, what do you think? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=183.84s)]
*  Well, we're talking about President Bill Clinton, Yale Law School graduate, President Richard [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=184.84s)]
*  Nixon, Duke Law School graduate. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=190.08s)]
*  They firmly believe that the president can absolutely be charged with crimes, certainly [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=192.8s)]
*  after leaving office. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=200.2s)]
*  And so this is one of those opinions that says to America, it says to every high school [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=201.92000000000002s)]
*  history student in America, you're not crazy. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=208.08s)]
*  It's what you thought. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=211.6s)]
*  It's what we've always thought for the entire history of the republic. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=212.92s)]
*  This is the way it is. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=216.92s)]
*  And if we think back to the beginning of this case, there wasn't a single legal pundit, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=218.35999999999999s)]
*  there wasn't anybody in the right wing anywhere saying, oh, well, you know, you can't indict [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=223.0s)]
*  him. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=229.04s)]
*  He's completely immune. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=230.04s)]
*  This notion had never even been advanced by anyone until Trump's lawyers decided to advance [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=231.88s)]
*  it in this case. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=237.57999999999998s)]
*  And so, I mean, it kind of took everyone by surprise in how outrageous it was. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=239.28s)]
*  And what you have here now is the proof that there is a very big difference between what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=244.88s)]
*  we call a novel case, which is this interesting issue that has never floated up all the way [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=249.51999999999998s)]
*  to the Supreme Court. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=254.92s)]
*  Which is Thursday, I think it's fair to say. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=255.92s)]
*  And a crazy case, which has absolutely no conceivable basis. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=257.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=262.08s)]
*  And there's, I mean, in some ways, I almost felt like it was, it's sort of a strange thing [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=263.08s)]
*  to read the opinion, because it's incredibly persuasive, Rachel, and very thorough and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=267.44s)]
*  goes through a bunch of stuff. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=271.52s)]
*  But at some level, it was like, the essential point was so ludicrous that it almost made [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=272.71999999999997s)]
*  me mad that we, like, this is the way the system works. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=278.84s)]
*  And it's, you know, it's important that the system work its way through. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=282.68s)]
*  But there was almost some sense, and it was like, right, of course, you know, as they [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=285.56s)]
*  went through every example, as they cited chapter and verse, as they, you know, limbed [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=289.12s)]
*  the lines of executive authority jurisprudence from Marbury to Youngstown and on and on and [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=294.8s)]
*  on, it was like, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, this is precisely what it looks like, to Lawrence's [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=300.88s)]
*  point. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=306.4s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=307.4s)]
*  And it's what we've all known was true all along. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=308.4s)]
*  And you're trying to say that this is, you know, that we shouldn't believe our lying [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=311.96s)]
*  eyes and the presidency has always been something different. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=315.84s)]
*  Here's all the ways in which that's not true. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=318.52s)]
*  That's absolutely right. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=320.4s)]
*  I will say that the other piece of this that I was just pleased to read is that there is [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=321.64s)]
*  an element of the defense that Trump has mounted, both in public relations, both as a public [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=329.47999999999996s)]
*  relations matter, but also as a legal matter to some extent. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=336.2s)]
*  And I think of it as the the mirrored sunglasses problem. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=341.2s)]
*  Like, do we really want to be a country in which some lieutenant colonel in mirrored [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=345.32s)]
*  sunglasses has every incentive to hold on to power for his entire natural life? [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=350.0s)]
*  Because the expectation is that once you're no longer holding the reins of power, you're [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=355.62s)]
*  going to be prosecuted by your political enemies and by your political successors. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=359.8s)]
*  I mean, it sucks to be a country where former presidents get prosecuted because that's a [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=363.04s)]
*  lousy thing about countries in which that's a that's a regular dynamic in which those [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=369.28s)]
*  prosecutions are politically motivated and and they're junk prosecutions, but they're [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=374.28s)]
*  used for political purposes. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=378.96s)]
*  Trump has made that case both in the courtroom and outside the court. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  And I've always felt like it's his his strongest point. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=384.4s)]
*  Obviously, the solution to that as a country is don't elect fricking criminals to be presidents. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=386.88s)]
*  But you also got the judges today and the in the D.C. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=392.88s)]
*  Circuit arguing against it and saying, listen, we have we have ways in our system of dealing [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=395.4s)]
*  with yes meritless and harassing prosecution. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=400.79999999999995s)]
*  We have systems within our judiciary that prevent that. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=404.88s)]
*  And so the idea that once you're prosecuted for crimes, you're going to then prosecute [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=409.8s)]
*  and everybody's going to prosecute people for nothing from here on out. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=414.88s)]
*  No, the judiciary is here to make sure that doesn't happen. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=418.24s)]
*  And we know that it won't. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=421.4s)]
*  And seeing that asserted by this panel of judges to me actually made me feel better [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=423.08s)]
*  about that problem for the first time since this whole merry-go-round started spinning [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=428.1s)]
*  around. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=432.52s)]
*  Donald, I want to just read this truth social post. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=434.52s)]
*  Do we have that from the last block? [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=439.96s)]
*  Maybe that just got taken away from me. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=441.35999999999996s)]
*  Basically, Trump has been saying time and time again that if if there's no immunity, [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=443.56s)]
*  then every president to Rachel's point in the previous block, then every president will [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=450.56s)]
*  face prosecution afterwards. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=453.68s)]
*  And that always reads to me as an obvious threat. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=455.64s)]
*  I mean, it seems to me he's saying not just to show that truth social post. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=458.03999999999996s)]
*  Blah, blah, blah, that must have full immunity in order to a president will be afraid to [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=463.52000000000004s)]
*  act, I know from personal experience. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=467.68s)]
*  Even our elections will be corrupted and under siege. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=470.24s)]
*  So bad, so dangerous for a nation. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=472.0s)]
*  Save presidential immunity. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=473.56s)]
*  Basically, he's saying like, I'm going to prosecute Joe Biden if I'm elected. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=474.96000000000004s)]
*  That's the way those always read to me. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=479.96000000000004s)]
*  Yeah, I wasn't reading it as that future thing. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=481.44000000000005s)]
*  I was just reading it as the kind of dumb Trump idea about the way the world works. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=484.12s)]
*  But you're absolutely right. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=488.12s)]
*  He's saying this absolutely allows me to do it. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=489.12s)]
*  I'll do it. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=492.08000000000004s)]
*  What's so striking about it is that as the court points out in the opinion, [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=493.64000000000004s)]
*  one thing that matters when you say if this happens, then this will happen. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=499.0s)]
*  You know, I mean, what meteorology is interested in is, hey, if it comes up this way, [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=503.28000000000003s)]
*  if the track is this way, this will happen. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=507.68s)]
*  How do we know that? [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=509.76s)]
*  Oh, because we've been studying it for 100 years. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=510.56s)]
*  We have a couple of hundred years of this not happening. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=512.76s)]
*  A couple of hundred years. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=515.5600000000001s)]
*  And the court was very impressed. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=517.32s)]
*  Court says we're really impressed with a couple of hundred years of this [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=519.3199999999999s)]
*  absolutely not happening when the presidents believed that it could. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=522.8399999999999s)]
*  I mean, you can go into these presidencies and discover that, yes, [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=528.12s)]
*  Franklin Roosevelt was worried that this idea might be against the law. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=531.56s)]
*  Therefore, he won't do it. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=536.12s)]
*  Harry Truman was worried that seizing the steel mills could be against the law. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=537.28s)]
*  But he did it and he found out it was against the law and he couldn't do it. [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=541.3199999999999s)]
*  You know, they've always been worried about is this against the law and can I do it? [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=544.68s)]
*  There's also this really interesting section, Rachel, [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=549.12s)]
*  where it's not just the history of the presidency, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=551.3599999999999s)]
*  but they also do this analogizing to other positions. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=553.7199999999999s)]
*  And there's a few different examples, right? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=556.4s)]
*  Juries, right? [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=558.0s)]
*  Like jurors, we need them to make tough calls and use their discretion. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=559.12s)]
*  But like, there's stuff that they could do that would be criminal in their official duty. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=562.4799999999999s)]
*  Like if someone paid them to vote a certain way, that would be criminal. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=566.9599999999999s)]
*  Judges. Judges have to make a ton of tough calls. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=569.8399999999999s)]
*  You know that, judges, justices were writing for. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=572.64s)]
*  But also judges can be prosecuted. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=575.28s)]
*  And it all seems to work out, like, [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=577.48s)]
*  members of Congress have to make tough discretionary calls [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=579.08s)]
*  about what's legal, what's not, like, also can be prosecuted. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=582.2s)]
*  They sort of go through all these other examples, like, [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=584.84s)]
*  yeah, there's all these people that have to do difficult stuff, [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=586.84s)]
*  make tough calls about what the law is, [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=589.4s)]
*  and none of them are rendered immune. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=591.5600000000001s)]
*  Right. And there's, I mean, they go back to cases from the 30s. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=595.48s)]
*  They go through all of those different examples. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=599.4s)]
*  They go through all these different presidential examples that we just talked about, [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=601.24s)]
*  including, I mean, again, most famously, why did Ford need to pardon Nixon? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=605.5600000000001s)]
*  It's, I mean, it says in the proclamation, [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=611.16s)]
*  as a result of certain acts or omissions occurring before his resignation from the [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=613.72s)]
*  office of president, Richard Nixon has become liable to possible indictment and trial. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=617.48s)]
*  Right. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=622.36s)]
*  For offenses against the United States. Right? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=622.84s)]
*  Like, it wasn't something we had to, like, read into their state of mind. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=624.9200000000001s)]
*  Like, it's explicit in the proclamation. [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=627.72s)]
*  Everybody knows that after a president leaves office, [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=629.88s)]
*  he or she can be indicted. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=634.04s)]
*  And that has always been baked in to what presidents have done. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=635.64s)]
*  So this idea that it'll be a new thing and it will make all presidents afraid and timid, [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=639.3199999999999s)]
*  they both disprove it in the law and they disprove it historically, [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=644.4399999999999s)]
*  and they disprove it in a way that just makes sense to the average American who isn't a lawyer, [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=647.88s)]
*  who's trying to understand what's happening with this very radical thing going on [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=652.76s)]
*  in Republican party politics, trying to put this guy on the ballot again. [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=656.84s)]
*  Yeah. And to that point about public audience, judicial audience, right? [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=660.52s)]
*  Because there are two throughout all this. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=663.88s)]
*  And there's two, there's, you know, they're very frank about sort of different [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=665.24s)]
*  sort of interests at play, right? [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=668.28s)]
*  Presidential interest to act with some latitude in a difficult job, [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=670.4399999999999s)]
*  the public interest in making sure that people don't try to, like, overturn elections and [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=673.88s)]
*  foment violent coups on the Capitol, which they talk about. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=677.8s)]
*  Now we've got this question about the public interest of this thing getting to trial. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=681.0s)]
*  So here's the timing. [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=685.56s)]
*  They say the clerk, meaning the court clerk, [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=686.4399999999999s)]
*  is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=688.44s)]
*  That's basically the sort of possession of the case back to Judge Tony Chetkin [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=690.6800000000001s)]
*  through February 12th, 2024. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=694.7600000000001s)]
*  And then within that period, the appellant notifies the clerk in writing [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=697.6400000000001s)]
*  he's filed an application to the Supreme Court. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=700.0400000000001s)]
*  The clerk is directed to withhold issuance of the mandate pending the [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=701.8800000000001s)]
*  Supreme Court's final disposition application, which means it now goes to the court, [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=704.6800000000001s)]
*  which has a monumental decision both on the merits, but also on the timing. [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=708.6800000000001s)]
*  Yeah. The Supreme Court is faced with a strange one here. [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=712.5200000000001s)]
*  If this was any other litigant, they wouldn't take it. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=717.56s)]
*  I think that's right. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=720.12s)]
*  It's a preposterous claim. [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=720.92s)]
*  An appeals court is dealing effectively with a completely preposterous claim. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=722.76s)]
*  And so the only reason to take it is, well, it's presidential, so maybe we should weigh in. [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=726.4399999999999s)]
*  But they have to know that they're going to have Seal Team Six in the hearing, [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=730.68s)]
*  in the Supreme Court. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=736.5999999999999s)]
*  It's not going to be one question about Seal Team Six. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=737.8s)]
*  You know, there are going to be several judges who have an opportunity to question [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=740.76s)]
*  about Donald Trump's ability to have as many Supreme Court justices as he wants executed [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=744.84s)]
*  so that he can get the opinions he wants out of the Supreme Court. [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=752.6800000000001s)]
*  And he cannot be prosecuted for that if he also executes enough United States senators [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=756.2800000000001s)]
*  so that he cannot be found guilty in an impeachment trial. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=762.6s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:12:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=765.96s)]
*  And so there's a circus. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=766.6800000000001s)]
*  The Supreme Court knows, oh my God, there's a horrible, stupid circus coming our way. [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=768.12s)]
*  Yes. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=773.96s)]
*  All we have to do is deny cert. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=774.36s)]
*  Well, and it contrasts a little bit with the position of the case, its posture, Rachel, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=776.92s)]
*  going forward, right? [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=782.6800000000001s)]
*  Because the case they're going to hear here on Thursday, they had to take, basically. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=783.48s)]
*  I think we would all sort of all agree, right? [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=788.12s)]
*  Like, you know, Colorado kicked the guy off the ballot. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=790.2s)]
*  So did Maine. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=794.2s)]
*  Other states aren't. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=794.84s)]
*  There's got to be some of the highest court in the land is going to be the one that's [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=796.36s)]
*  ultimately going to give us a constitutional ruling on this. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=798.6800000000001s)]
*  They had to get involved in this one, to Lawrence's point, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=801.24s)]
*  they simply don't. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=804.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=807.08s)]
*  And the mechanics of how that happens, though, end up being important. [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=808.04s)]
*  I mean, you only need four Supreme Court justices to say, yes, we want to hear it, [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=811.24s)]
*  which means you need that. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=816.2s)]
*  I mean, you don't you don't need a majority. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=818.12s)]
*  You only need four. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=819.8000000000001s)]
*  It's easy to imagine then them coming up with the four, even if it is impossible to [[00:13:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=820.92s)]
*  imagine them deciding on the merits in Trump's favor. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=826.12s)]
*  And so do they want to take the case? [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=829.32s)]
*  They don't have to agree to have a incredibly radical, stupid ruling in order to do [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=832.6s)]
*  Donald Trump a big favor here. [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=837.88s)]
*  They just have to agree to hear it and then go slow and hope that Trump gets elected, [[00:13:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=839.4s)]
*  in which case all these cases go away. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=845.4s)]
*  And that's that seems to me. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=847.48s)]
*  I mean, that's I don't know what we should expect from this Supreme Court. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=849.5600000000001s)]
*  It's amazing. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=853.08s)]
*  They're going to get the disqualification issue on Thursday and the immunity issue on [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=853.72s)]
*  Monday. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=858.36s)]
*  I don't know what to expect for them. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=859.72s)]
*  But certainly, if they want to help Trump here, they have lots of ways to do it. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=860.92s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=865.0s)]
*  And we should also say that this is this court's posture has been an incredibly [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=865.24s)]
*  imperious and greedy one about what they get to say on what issues of public life they [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PLANKohaQv0&t=872.52s)]
