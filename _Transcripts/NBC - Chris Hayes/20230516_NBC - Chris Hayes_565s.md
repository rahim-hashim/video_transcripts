# Elon Musk: 'So be it' if tweeting conspiracies, extremism loses him money
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g)
*  Billionaire Elon Musk bought Twitter back in October. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=0.0s)]
*  It's a microblogging site. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=3.0s)]
*  I like it a lot, but like let's just okay. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=4.3s)]
*  He bought it for a whopping $44 billion. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=6.9s)]
*  It's a private company now, so we don't know what its business [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=9.4s)]
*  internals look like, but by all accounts, advertisers has [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=11.6s)]
*  absolutely fled. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=15.1s)]
*  His new subscriber service doesn't look like it's doing [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=16.3s)]
*  very well. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=18.900000000000002s)]
*  People think the company is worth way less than what he [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=19.3s)]
*  bought it for. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=21.900000000000002s)]
*  So he desperately needs someone new to bring in revenue, and it [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=23.2s)]
*  is against that backdrop that Musk is preparing to usher in a [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=26.7s)]
*  new CEO. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=29.5s)]
*  Her name is Linda Iaccarino. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=30.2s)]
*  She's a veteran of the advertising business until a few [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=32.2s)]
*  days ago. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=34.6s)]
*  She was actually the advertising chief at NBC. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=35.0s)]
*  She's going to have a work out for her. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=38.1s)]
*  This is what the current state of Twitter is right now. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=40.1s)]
*  As Ben Collins reported, if you search for cats or dogs on [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=43.0s)]
*  Twitter a few days ago, you got animal torture videos because [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=46.0s)]
*  apparently Twitter had screwed up the code that would have [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=49.3s)]
*  stopped that stuff from surfacing and instead they were [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=51.5s)]
*  surfacing it. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=53.8s)]
*  And then there's the guy who runs the website who really [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=55.2s)]
*  likes to tweet. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=57.3s)]
*  One of the richest men in the world is basically like thumbs [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=58.4s)]
*  upping and responding to just about every offensive racist [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=60.8s)]
*  right-wing meme he sees on the website. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=63.599999999999994s)]
*  Last night he compared George Soros to the most infamous [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=66.7s)]
*  Jewish villain in comic book history saying that Soros hates [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=69.5s)]
*  humanity. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=73.3s)]
*  The Anti-Defamation League called the tweet dangerous. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=74.69999999999999s)]
*  Israel's foreign ministry accused Musk of stoking anti- [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=77.0s)]
*  semitism on his platform. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=79.7s)]
*  Tonight Musk defended his comments in an extensive painful [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=81.6s)]
*  interview on CNBC. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=85.7s)]
*  You tweeted this thing about George Soros. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=88.5s)]
*  I'm looking for it because I want to make sure I quoted [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=92.1s)]
*  properly, but I mean, you know what you wrote, but you basically [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=94.0s)]
*  I said it reminds me of Magneto. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=97.0s)]
*  This is like calm down people. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=98.1s)]
*  This is not like made a pivotal case out of it. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=99.5s)]
*  You said he wants to erode the very fabric of civilization [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=103.39999999999999s)]
*  and Soros hates humanity. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=106.1s)]
*  Like when you do something like that, do you think about [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=107.5s)]
*  that's my opinion. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=110.3s)]
*  Do your tweets hurt the company? [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=111.1s)]
*  Are there Tesla owners who say I don't agree with his political [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=113.2s)]
*  position because and I know it because he shares so much of [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=115.8s)]
*  it or there are advertisers on Twitter that Linda Yark Arena [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=118.89999999999999s)]
*  will come and say you got to stop man or you know, I can't [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=121.6s)]
*  get these ads because of some of the things you tweet. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=125.1s)]
*  You know, I'm reminded of [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=127.5s)]
*  The scene in the princess bride great movie great [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=145.5s)]
*  where he confronts the person who killed his father. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=151.9s)]
*  He says [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=155.6s)]
*  Offer me money offer me power. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=166.5s)]
*  See you just don't care. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=170.9s)]
*  You want to share what you have to say. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=175.1s)]
*  I'll say what I want to say and if the consequence of that is [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=177.79999999999998s)]
*  losing money, so be it. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=182.2s)]
*  Join now by NBC News senior reporter Ben Collins who wrote [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=183.7s)]
*  about the grotesque cat search issue on Twitter and Michelle [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=187.2s)]
*  Goldberg whose latest op-ed of the New York Times focused on [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=190.29999999999998s)]
*  the influence of Christian nationalism. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=192.7s)]
*  I mean, I think that was like a him making himself out to be [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=195.6s)]
*  way more heroic than he is like I don't care about money. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=200.29999999999998s)]
*  I don't care about power. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=203.7s)]
*  I just care about like posting but it's like well, there is [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=204.7s)]
*  part of that. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=207.79999999999998s)]
*  That's true though, right? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean has spent this enormous amount of money. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=209.29999999999998s)]
*  I mean just right to post and posting is clearly his life's [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=212.9s)]
*  passion. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=217.4s)]
*  That's what that's the Matt right. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=218.0s)]
*  He just does it all day long and which I find relatable. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=219.70000000000002s)]
*  Yes, but he is doing it no matter and he's burning through [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=227.0s)]
*  billions of dollars to and he exists as both. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=229.4s)]
*  I mean you both shouldn't be on Twitter because Elon Musk owns [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=232.3s)]
*  it but also Elon Musk is the incarnation of why you shouldn't [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=235.9s)]
*  be on Twitter because he shows you every day what Twitter does [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=239.1s)]
*  to someone's brain, right? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=242.3s)]
*  I mean you just have cautionary right you watch this person [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=244.0s)]
*  kind of be radicalized and red-pilled in real time is every [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=247.5s)]
*  trollish conspiracy theory. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=252.0s)]
*  He just mainlines and then regurgitates it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=253.8s)]
*  It's like the it's like when you go to a candle shop and the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=256.90000000000003s)]
*  candles look so beautiful and pristine and then like when it's [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=258.90000000000003s)]
*  like melted down and it's like dripping like that's it's like [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=261.1s)]
*  that's the before and after. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=263.8s)]
*  Yeah, I mean the other thing we should note about this is that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=265.2s)]
*  a big talking point of the right right now is look Twitter [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=268.2s)]
*  just got rid of 90% of its staff and operates just the same [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=271.0s)]
*  and by the way, no it does not right. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=273.8s)]
*  You know you are searching for the word cat and you get a cat [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=275.9s)]
*  literally inside of a blender being blended to death don't [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=279.4s)]
*  want to talk about that on TV. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=281.9s)]
*  But that is what's going on and that's because he ripped out [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=283.5s)]
*  the wires that would have made that happen and he eliminated [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=287.7s)]
*  the staff that would have checked this was there. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=290.1s)]
*  I talked to the guy who used to run this. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=292.5s)]
*  He said there were multiple layers of redundancy that would [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=294.0s)]
*  prevent snuff films from appearing on this website and now [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=296.3s)]
*  they're gone. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=299.3s)]
*  Yeah, and look this guy is going through what a lot of people [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=300.0s)]
*  did during the pandemic right. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=303.6s)]
*  We all know somebody who kind of like lost it because they were [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=306.1s)]
*  like deep on the air all the way in and like they were previously [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=309.3s)]
*  kind of normal or they were a little bit funky and then they [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=313.2s)]
*  lost it right. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=315.5s)]
*  That's what's going on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=316.7s)]
*  I'm just wondering how long watching it. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=317.40000000000003s)]
*  Yes, we're having a real time. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=319.3s)]
*  I'm just wondering how long like Titans of industry and people [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=320.6s)]
*  who are trying to do business with this guy and his other [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=323.1s)]
*  ventures are going to put up with this stuff. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=326.0s)]
*  I mean, there's something more than though. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=327.3s)]
*  So it's also like he's he's you know, first of all, he's just [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=328.5s)]
*  like not he's like the least entertaining poster ever. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=331.0s)]
*  He's not funny or witty. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=333.3s)]
*  There's nothing sort of clever interesting. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=334.4s)]
*  He doesn't have any like innate talent for it and yet desperately [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=335.9s)]
*  wants to be it. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=339.1s)]
*  That is really it's intense levels of pathos wrapped up in [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=339.8s)]
*  this but the other thing is like he just saying, you know, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=344.2s)]
*  there's a shooting in Allen, Texas, right and Bellingcat really [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=346.6s)]
*  interesting journalistic outfit that does sort of open source [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=351.7s)]
*  research located the profile for the shooter. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=355.40000000000003s)]
*  He was very clearly in a valid white supremacist Nazi. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=358.8s)]
*  He had a Latino surname, but those two things are not [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=363.8s)]
*  incommensurate. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=366.0s)]
*  They can coexist and you know, Elon Musk calls it into calls [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=367.8s)]
*  it into question is like a Psyop when Paul Pelosi is attacked, [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=373.0s)]
*  you know, he posts this like disgusting fabricated conspiracy [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=376.90000000000003s)]
*  theories like that part of it is like forget what his bad views [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=380.8s)]
*  are like he is mainlining like false things and I think more [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=383.8s)]
*  than that. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=387.6s)]
*  I mean, I believe he shadow banned Bellingcat and so I think [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=387.90000000000003s)]
*  what you see with him, you know, harder to get to their right [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=391.1s)]
*  which is kind of was the big right-wing argument about why [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=395.0s)]
*  Twitter was violating the First Amendment before Elon Musk took [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=398.0s)]
*  over. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=400.7s)]
*  I think that all of this is of the piece you see for example, [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=401.3s)]
*  what Elon Musk has done in Turkey where he you know, is seated [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=404.3s)]
*  to the Erdogan government's demands that Twitter take down, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=407.5s)]
*  you know kind of content about the opposition content. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=412.2s)]
*  So he is basically he is the you know, kind of he's he turned [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=415.59999999999997s)]
*  Twitter into on many different fronts a vehicle for authoritarianism [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=421.4s)]
*  both, you know kind of spouting authoritarian content and tamping [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=425.7s)]
*  down on content that would challenge authoritarianism in terms [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=430.59999999999997s)]
*  of the advertising. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=433.79999999999995s)]
*  I mean they are an advertising company. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=434.5s)]
*  They have been to the extent they were ever profitable. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=436.9s)]
*  It just seems like you're not like what are you going to do put [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=439.5s)]
*  your tweets next to him saying George Soros is a big comic book [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=442.0s)]

*  last few years. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=451.6s)]
*  I've had to go to the worst websites in the world every day [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=452.1s)]

*  website and that is I don't know how long this is going to [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fv-lcY40s8g&t=471.40000000000003s)]
