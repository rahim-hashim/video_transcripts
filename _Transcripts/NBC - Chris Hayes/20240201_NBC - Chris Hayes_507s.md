# Podcaster Ted Cruz complains about ‘tough re-election race’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4)
*  I'm right now, as you know, in a very tough re-election race in Texas. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=0.0s)]
*  The Democrats, Chuck Schumer has made clear I'm his number one target. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=5.14s)]
*  The Democrats intend to spend over $100 million to defeat me in Texas. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=8.78s)]
*  We just had a poll last week that showed it as a one-point race, and yet we can expect [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=13.52s)]
*  Mitch again not to spend any money to defend me. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=18.64s)]
*  I'm sitting in a glass house throwing stones. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=23.32s)]
*  Take it from someone who knows that that guy really likes the sound of his own voice. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=25.76s)]
*  The last time that Ted Cruz ran for re-election, he sweated out a narrow victory over Beto O'Rourke [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=30.400000000000002s)]
*  of less than three points. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=35.36s)]
*  You would think that would be a wake-up call for the Texas senator to start laser-focusing [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=36.78s)]
*  on the needs of his constituents. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=40.58s)]
*  But instead, just over two years after his narrow victory, he tried to secretly jet off [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=42.300000000000004s)]
*  to Cancun during the worst weather disaster his state had seen in a long time, one that [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=46.980000000000004s)]
*  killed nearly 250 people. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=51.02s)]
*  Recently it seems like he's basically reduced himself to being a part-time senator and nearly [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=54.120000000000005s)]
*  full-time podcaster. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=59.06s)]
*  Get this, last week he posted five different episodes. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=61.300000000000004s)]
*  Five different podcast episodes. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=66.06s)]
*  He's a senator! [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=67.7s)]
*  He is now facing another real re-election challenge, and as you heard, he's a little [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=68.7s)]
*  worried. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  He's not getting the support he needs from fellow Republicans. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=74.74000000000001s)]
*  Congressman Colin Allred of Texas is running in the Democratic race against Texas State [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=77.34s)]
*  Senator Roland Gutierrez and others to challenge Cruz. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=80.98s)]
*  He previously served in the Department of Housing and Urban Development under President [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=84.02000000000001s)]
*  Obama. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=87.58s)]
*  He was an NFL linebacker and I just learned he's a fourth generation Texan. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=88.7s)]
*  Good to have you here. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=91.94s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=92.94s)]
*  Okay, this is, people might think this is weird or petty, but I'm going to talk. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=93.94s)]
*  I think it's weird for a U.S. senator to do five podcasts episodes a week. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=98.02s)]
*  I'm not wrong, right? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=101.94s)]
*  That's right. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=102.94s)]
*  No, that's right. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=103.94s)]
*  It's very time-consuming. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=104.94s)]
*  Like when I appear on a podcast, it takes time. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=105.94s)]
*  But being the host, and he normally does three a week, so that was actually news for me that [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=107.9s)]
*  he was up to five. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=112.7s)]
*  He's a media personality. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=114.62s)]
*  He's not serious about being a senator. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=115.62s)]
*  I feel like there's some level at which maybe if you beat him, you help him. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=116.66000000000001s)]
*  Because I think he really just wants to do that full-time, which again, no shade. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=120.66000000000001s)]
*  You know what I mean? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=124.98s)]
*  But you might be giving him a hand. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=125.98s)]
*  Yeah, that's what he wants to do. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=127.22s)]
*  He's not a serious legislator. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=128.38s)]
*  I mean, we're talking about these negotiations in the Senate right now. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=129.38s)]
*  You'll never see him a part of those negotiations. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=132.62s)]
*  He won't be rolling up his sleeves and trying to figure out a compromise on how we can legislate [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=134.54000000000002s)]
*  to move forward. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=138.82s)]
*  This is what he does. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=139.86s)]
*  He goes on podcasts, he goes on cable news, and that's what he does. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=140.86s)]
*  In fact, I thought this border story that we just talked about, you would have a lot [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=143.62s)]
*  to say about. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=147.42000000000002s)]
*  You have been critical of the handling by this President, Joe Biden, of the border. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=148.42000000000002s)]
*  You are among three Texas Democrats who voted to condemn the president's handling of the [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=153.02s)]
*  southern border. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=156.42000000000002s)]
*  You touted your own bipartisan legislation, would help secure the border, provide a pathway [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=157.86s)]
*  to citizenship for Dreamers and others who are living here, follow laws, surge resources [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=161.58s)]
*  to border patrol and border communities. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=165.46s)]
*  So you've been sort of trying to work on something like this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=166.74s)]
*  The Senate compromise doesn't even have some of the stuff in here. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=170.86s)]
*  Like there's no path to citizenship for the Dreamers, all this. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=174.3s)]
*  Right, that's right. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=176.78s)]
*  I know we don't have paper on it yet, but would you support that legislation? [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=177.78s)]
*  I mean, I think so. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=181.06s)]
*  We haven't gotten all the details, but from what we are seeing, it looks like it's an [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=182.34s)]
*  attempt to deal with an asylum system that's broken, to a faster process and to set some [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=185.82000000000002s)]
*  standards that I think probably have to be set in terms of what's the threshold to have [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=190.94000000000003s)]
*  your asylum claim heard. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=194.74s)]
*  But listen, Ted Cruz is not going to be a part of any of this. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=196.62s)]
*  He said in a Senate meeting, kind of leaked out, I guess, a lunch meeting of theirs, that [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=199.98s)]
*  he's worried about the politics of it, not the policy, the politics of it. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=204.38s)]
*  And that's where the cynicism comes in. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=207.9s)]
*  That's what I think Texans are so sick of. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=209.73999999999998s)]
*  I mean, I think he said both privately and publicly. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=211.29999999999998s)]
*  So I think what happened was that there was that caucus lunch they all had after the deal [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=213.62s)]
*  was struck and it was after Trump won New Hampshire, McConnell's like, the politics [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=217.26s)]
*  of this have changed. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=220.9s)]
*  We need the crisis. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=222.18s)]
*  Basically, he didn't say this, but we want the crisis to keep going. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=223.18s)]
*  I guess it makes me wonder, like, maybe they don't think it's great. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=226.9s)]
*  I mean, like, I just find it pretty wild. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=230.10000000000002s)]
*  Like, to me, it's a really defining issue about the nature of these different senators. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=232.38000000000002s)]
*  Like Langford is a conservative dude in your neighboring state of Oklahoma. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=236.38000000000002s)]
*  He's not like a squish. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=240.94000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=241.94000000000003s)]
*  And he's running around being like, guys, we got it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=242.94000000000003s)]
*  Let's do it. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=244.94000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=245.94000000000003s)]
*  Also for Texas, you know, we're a border state. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=246.94000000000003s)]
*  And so there's probably no state that would, that needs this to be addressed more. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=248.54000000000002s)]
*  The vast majority of the crossings are happening in Texas. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=251.94000000000003s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=254.66000000000003s)]
*  And I think that's a record number in December, over 300,000. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=256.46s)]
*  Texas feels that. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=258.46s)]
*  So you would think that a Texas senator would then say, I want to respond to this and find [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=259.46s)]
*  a way legislatively. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=263.14s)]
*  But of course, as we saw in the clip there, and as we know from his character, he's just [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=264.98s)]
*  looking for the next election so he can keep podcasting. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=268.38s)]
*  One of the issues that I think there will be a very clear difference between, if you [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=271.74s)]
*  were to win the nomination, I think any Democrat, frankly, against Ted Cruz will be on the issue [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=275.54s)]
*  of abortion. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=278.86s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=279.86s)]
*  I'm strongly in favor of the Supreme Court's Dabz decision, strongly opposed to abortion, [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=281.06s)]
*  right? [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=285.66s)]
*  So I want to just play a little bit of your campaign ad because I think it highlights [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=286.66s)]
*  the message that you or other Democrats, not just in Texas, are going to be running [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=290.94s)]
*  on in this year. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=294.46000000000004s)]
*  Take a listen. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=295.46000000000004s)]
*  For women in this state, the fear is real. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=296.46000000000004s)]
*  Texas's abortion ban is a threat to their lives, to all of our freedom. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=300.1s)]
*  That's why I'm running for Senate, to end this abortion ban, because in Texas, we stand [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=304.02000000000004s)]
*  up for freedom. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=308.54s)]
*  Your state has a very restrictive ban. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=310.66s)]
*  It was at the front edge of this, obviously, with the SB8 law. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=312.38000000000005s)]
*  Do you think an abortion rights referendum statewide would win in Texas? [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=317.3s)]
*  I think it would. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=323.94000000000005s)]
*  I don't think the legislature will let us do that. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=324.94000000000005s)]
*  They never will. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=326.66s)]
*  No. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=327.66s)]
*  But what's happening in Texas is a tragedy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=328.66s)]
*  It really is. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=330.82000000000005s)]
*  What we are seeing is what a total ban on abortion looks like, which is a mother of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cfw3Wd4oHy4&t=331.82000000000005s)]
