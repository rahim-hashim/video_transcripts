# ‘Designed to start a war’: Israel obtained Hamas battle plan more than a year ago, NYT reports
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 30, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo)
*  We are following some breaking news this hour, a truly remarkable report out of the New York [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=0.0s)]
*  Times about the extent to which Israel was warned about Hamas' intentions to start a [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=6.36s)]
*  war ahead of the deadly October 7 attacks. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=11.72s)]
*  Quote, Israeli officials obtained Hamas' battle plan for the October 7 terrorist attack more [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=15.0s)]
*  than a year before it happened, documents, emails and interviews show. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=21.64s)]
*  But Israeli military and intelligence officials dismissed the plan as aspirational, considering [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=26.240000000000002s)]
*  it too difficult for Hamas to carry out. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=31.44s)]
*  The approximately 40 page document, which the Israeli authorities codenamed Jericho Wall, [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=34.6s)]
*  outlined point by point exactly the kind of devastating invasion that led to the deaths [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=40.24s)]
*  of about 1200 people. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=45.2s)]
*  According to one intelligence analyst in Israel, this was not merely a plan for an attack. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=47.400000000000006s)]
*  Quote, it is a plan designed to start a war. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=51.84s)]
*  Ben Rhodes served as deputy national security adviser to President Barack Obama and he [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=55.36s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=60.0s)]
*  Ben, this just published before it went to air, so I just want to sort of set the table [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=61.16s)]
*  for folks. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=64.68s)]
*  I mean, it's not just that there's a battle plan. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=65.12s)]
*  It is the battle plan. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=67.52s)]
*  It involves things like paragliders going over the fence. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=68.84s)]
*  It involves machine guns and drones to take out security cameras. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=73.0s)]
*  It involves initiating with a barrage of rockets, motorcycles going over the fence. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=76.56s)]
*  I mean, it's literally the plan and they had it inside the Israeli intelligence apparatus. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=83.0s)]
*  What's your, as someone who works in the United States in security apparatus, what is your [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=89.16s)]
*  reaction to this? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=94.36s)]
*  I mean, it's absolutely astonishing, Chris, because it's your point. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=96.8s)]
*  Sometimes you have warning that something might happen, but very rarely, if ever, do [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=100.08s)]
*  you have this level of specificity. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=104.96000000000001s)]
*  I mean, before I was in the Obama administration, I worked for the vice chair of the 9-11 [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=107.8s)]
*  commission on the 9-11 commission. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=111.48s)]
*  And this would be analogous to the U.S. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  government having had information that Al-Qaeda was planning to try to fly planes into these [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=116.36s)]
*  targets from these airports and had people in flight schools. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=123.08s)]
*  I mean, this is a level of specificity that intelligence almost never gets. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=125.60000000000001s)]
*  And that's what is so astonishing about this reporting. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=131.2s)]
*  It wasn't just like a concern that Hamas might be up to something. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=134.4s)]
*  They might be trying to plan something big. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=138.12s)]
*  You usually get those types of warnings, reflections and conversations or intercepted [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=139.79999999999998s)]
*  communications. This was the literal plan of what they actually ended up doing on October [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=144.51999999999998s)]
*  7th within the Israeli system for a full year. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=150.32s)]
*  That is something that is an intelligence and policy failure that goes beyond anything [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=154.11999999999998s)]
*  that I can think of, frankly. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=158.95999999999998s)]
*  Yeah, I was trying to search for something, some analog or precedent, and was coming up [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=160.92s)]
*  as well. Then there's another additional aspect to this that in some ways is even more [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=166.16000000000003s)]
*  damning, which is that at least one analyst in a unit in the Israeli intelligence system [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=170.44000000000003s)]
*  basically watched or saw that there was a rehearsal about six weeks before the attack [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=175.96s)]
*  and once again basically went to a superior and said, it looks like they're rehearsing [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=181.4s)]
*  the plan from that we have Jericho Wall and was again, as again, according to the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=188.20000000000002s)]
*  reporting we have in New York Times, encrypted emails they've obtained basically told, [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=194.4s)]
*  don't worry about it. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=199.16s)]
*  Yeah, so seeing the rehearsal and the thing to bear in mind, Chris, and we don't know yet [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=201.68s)]
*  how far up, I mean, there are questions that remain. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=206.8s)]
*  The questions that I would have are, was this plan briefed to Prime Minister Netanyahu [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=208.76s)]
*  or people who are government ministers? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=214.52s)]
*  How high up did this go in the system? [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=216.44s)]
*  I'd be surprised. It'd be weird if something of this scale wasn't, but that'd be its own [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=218.76s)]
*  version of a failure. The thing that people have to bear in mind here is that not only was there [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=223.28s)]
*  not an action taken to disrupt this, but in fact, on October 7th, what had happened is the [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=227.16s)]
*  IDF that would normally be at that border had been redirected up to the West Bank because they [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=233.72s)]
*  were busy protecting settlers, Israeli settlers who were engaging, often initiating clashes with [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=240.0s)]
*  Palestinians. So actually the border wasn't even at the normal status quo of security. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=245.36s)]
*  It was less. And that's the policy failure to redirect those resources up to the West Bank. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=250.0s)]
*  You would think that if you had this kind of planning and you were seeing this kind of activity [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=255.84s)]
*  by Hamas, that we have reporting of additional warnings from Egypt and other places about this [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=259.76s)]
*  potentially. So you would think that you would be trying to do everything you could to fortify that [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=265.92s)]
*  border and at least hedge against the fact that this plan might go forward, if not try to actively [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=270.24s)]
*  disrupt it. None of that happened. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=275.12s)]
*  Yeah. As we dealt with the aftermath of October 7th, and I think as Americans tried to figure out [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=277.92s)]
*  a way to understand it, the 9-11 has stood out as a touchstone or an American domestic experience. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=287.68s)]
*  And one of the ways that the reaction in the politics of Israel has been different than the [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=295.52s)]
*  U.S. is that there's been a huge rallying around the IDF and the war effort among Israeli [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  politics and in public opinion, but not around Benjamin Netanyahu, who has incredibly lower [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=306.88s)]
*  approval ratings, who in the most recent polling I saw today was only drawing 23 or 24 percent of [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=311.04s)]
*  the vote. And you really got to wonder what this does to an already extremely tenuous political [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=315.68s)]
*  position in a situation in which Netanyahu, it is understood, is going to face the music when the [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=321.44s)]
*  war ends, but also has every political incentive imaginable to extend the war as far as possible, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=327.12s)]
*  precisely because of this consensus view held across the ideological spectrum in Israel that [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=333.2s)]
*  he will face the music when the war ends. That's right, Chris. I mean, Netanyahu had been a [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=338.96s)]
*  political survivor for a long time. He'd become less popular because of corruption investigations, [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=343.68s)]
*  certainly because of the kind of judicial coup that he was engaged in. There were huge street [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=349.28s)]
*  protests, remember, against Netanyahu before October 7th. The one thing he had is that his [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=352.88s)]
*  nickname, his self-given nickname, was I'm Mr. Security. You know, you may not like certain [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=357.84s)]
*  things about me. You may not like some of my coalition, but I keep Israel safe. And that was [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=362.56s)]
*  shattered, obviously, on October 7th. And with each of these reports about the kind of incompetence or [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=367.28000000000003s)]
*  failure to protect that come out, that political standing suffers even more. I think, frankly, [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=372.56s)]
*  what is worrying is precisely because he's in such a weak political position. The only thing that is [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=379.36s)]
*  keeping him in office is this kind of emergency unity war cabinet that he is leading. The problem [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=386.08s)]
*  with that, the challenge from that strategically and politically, and I think from the United [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=392.4s)]
*  States perspective is, as you said, that gives him every incentive to try to perpetuate a war, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=396.08s)]
*  because I think everybody in Israel that I talk to, most political analysts agree that when the [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=402.71999999999997s)]
*  music stops, he's going to be replaced. That's just the nature of Israeli politics right now. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=407.84s)]
*  And that's an awkward position to be in, frankly. It's an uncomfortable position to be in. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=413.52s)]
*  Particularly, you have a massive aid package working its way through the U.S. Congress. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=418.23999999999995s)]
*  You have huge international opinion inflamed against the scale of this Israeli military [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=421.92s)]
*  operation. You obviously have a humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza. All these things are [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=425.68s)]
*  happening. This report comes out. He's a very politically damaged leader. And the question is, [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=429.04s)]
*  does he need to be replaced now? Can we really, can Israel afford to wait for some end of this [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=434.08000000000004s)]
*  military operation that has a kind of open-ended duration to it? Netanyahu himself has said we may [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=439.92s)]
*  have to have an open-ended administration of Gaza, which might suggest that there's not necessarily [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=444.24s)]
*  going to be a clear end date to this war from his perspective. Yeah, all of that is, I think, [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=449.6s)]
*  really, really well said and one of the main contextual issues here. To go back to your [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=454.72s)]
*  experience, and one of the things I thought about this, again, I think from the first moment that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=460.32000000000005s)]
*  the report started to come in of the scale of this attack, and how famous in many ways the Israeli [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=464.64000000000004s)]
*  intelligence and security apparatus is. It's one of the most sophisticated in the entire [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=472.56s)]
*  world. It's known as such. This question of how did this happen has been there from the first day. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=479.44s)]
*  I've also wondered, will there be some 9-11 commission? Is there going to be some? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=487.52s)]
*  And this makes, it just seems you have to do, I mean, there's a lot of questions raised by this, [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=492.56s)]
*  like how far up did it go? Who's this colonel who said no? Why did people think they weren't [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=497.6s)]
*  going to do it? How far did they circulate the reports that they were rehearsing, et cetera? [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=501.44s)]
*  No, that's right. I mean, Chris, my immediate reaction on October 7th is how could this have [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=505.92s)]
*  happened? Because just to give you one example, Israel controls the entire internet and [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=511.36s)]
*  telecommunications infrastructure in Gaza. So sure, Hamas can try to communicate offline, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=515.84s)]
*  but the idea that you could plan something of this sophistication without it interacting with the [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=522.08s)]
*  telecommunications network that Israel has visibility in, I just didn't get that. And part [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=527.04s)]
*  of what we're seeing now is actually they did have this information. And to your point, I think in [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=530.96s)]
*  Israel, what they've said is, well, they'll have to be a commission of ink for it. There'll have to [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=534.56s)]
*  be some look back at this. But again, like what politicians do, I think that Netanyahu's approach [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=538.56s)]
*  has been that's for after the war. We have to wait until after the war to look back. We have to be [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=543.68s)]
*  focused on what we're doing in Gaza now. The problem with that is Israelis need to have confidence in [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=548.56s)]
*  their political leadership, in their military leadership, in their intelligence community, [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=555.3599999999999s)]
*  the people that are carrying out the war, the people that are making [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=559.92s)]
*  hugely consequential decisions. And I don't know how you can have that confidence [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=563.04s)]
*  when there's reporting like this. This was this has always been an issue in just understanding [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkP8UiNiJBo&t=567.1999999999999s)]
