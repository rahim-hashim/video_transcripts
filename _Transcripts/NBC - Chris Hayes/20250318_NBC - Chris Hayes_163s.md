# Schumer slams Trump for tolerating antisemitism: ‘He’s not protecting Jewish people’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 18, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk)
*  Joining me again, New York Senator, Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, author of the new book [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=0.0s)]
*  Anti-Semitism in America, a warning. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=3.18s)]
*  You know, one of the—there's lots of awful things Trump says all the time. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=5.24s)]
*  A thing I find personally truly despicable is this use of the word Palestinian as a slur, [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=10.14s)]
*  as an insult, which he has now directed towards you multiple times, saying even that you're [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=15.860000000000001s)]
*  not Jewish anymore. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=21.26s)]
*  Yeah, don't tell my mother. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=22.54s)]
*  Look, Trump has far too often tolerated all kinds of anti-Semitic things. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=25.32s)]
*  He regards the Jews sort of as transactional. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=33.66s)]
*  So money, the Jews. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=37.1s)]
*  Votes, the Jews. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=40.06s)]
*  But no real understanding of who we are. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=41.46s)]
*  And look at the things he's done. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=43.34s)]
*  In Charlottesville, both sides are to blame. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=45.08s)]
*  He sits down with a known bigoted anti-Semite, Fuentes. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=47.32s)]
*  He has a lot of people in his administration who believe in this great replacement theory, [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=51.36000000000001s)]
*  which is an anti-Semitic troll—or not troll—philosophy on dangerous thinking. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=56.18000000000001s)]
*  And he cut off all the money. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=64.2s)]
*  We work very hard for this called Nonprofit Security Grant, money for synagogues that [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=66.54s)]
*  have been accosted by anti-Semitic activities, for doors, for windows, for protection. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=70.96000000000001s)]
*  So if you look at his actions, a lot of them, he's not protecting Jewish people. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=76.12s)]
*  Again, transactional. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=81.52000000000001s)]
*  You know what he ought to do, Chris? [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=83.44s)]
*  He ought to read my book. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=84.44s)]
*  He might learn something. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=86.04s)]
*  I learned today that there's a guy who runs the anti-Semitism task force in the Trump [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=87.88000000000001s)]
*  administration whose name is Leo Terrell, who is a civil rights attorney who has now [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=92.32000000000001s)]
*  been tasked with running this thing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=97.32000000000001s)]
*  And there was a tweet by a prominent neo-Nazi basically saying that Trump can revoke the [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=100.44000000000001s)]
*  Jew card, the Jewishness, that that guy, the anti-Semitism guy, retweeted. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=106.60000000000001s)]
*  Well, there should be an outcry from his right-wing friends and Jewish right-wing friends that [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=112.32000000000001s)]
*  that guy should be fired. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=117.36000000000001s)]
*  Will you come back when you don't have a book? [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=119.56s)]
*  Sure. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=124.08000000000001s)]
*  I've been here before without a book. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=125.08000000000001s)]
*  But come back for a good long one. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=126.92s)]
*  You have to go pay a shivacal, so I'm going to let you know, Senator Chuck Schumer. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=129.0s)]
*  It was really a pleasure. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=132.4s)]
*  Thank you so much. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=133.4s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=134.4s)]
*  Take care. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=135.4s)]
*  Chuck Schumer, leader of the Democratic Party. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=136.4s)]
*  He really does have to go. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=137.4s)]
*  His new book, Anti-Semitism in America, A Warning, is out today. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=138.4s)]
*  You can get it wherever you get your books. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BP3MI6uA1nk&t=141.32s)]
