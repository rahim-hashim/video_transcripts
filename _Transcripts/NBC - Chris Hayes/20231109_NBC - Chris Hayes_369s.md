# ‘You break it, you buy it’: GOP pays price for unpopular anti-abortion policies
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 09, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0)
*  Earlier this year, New York magazine writer at large, Rebecca Traister, wrote this big [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=0.0s)]
*  cover story about the emerging politics of abortion after the Supreme Court's decision [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=4.36s)]
*  to strike down Roe v. Wade. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=8.94s)]
*  At the time, there was still some debate around her hypothesis that abortion wins elections [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=11.4s)]
*  for Democrats who were entering, quote, a new era of political possibility. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=15.84s)]
*  But now, particularly after the wins for abortion rights that we saw this week, it's clear Rebecca [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=20.04s)]
*  Traister was correct. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=25.38s)]
*  And I think both parties understand that. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=26.38s)]
*  Joining me now is Rebecca Traister. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=29.88s)]
*  It's great to have you on the program. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=31.56s)]
*  It's always nice to write something and then have it borne out by subsequent events. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Did you anticipate that things would be as, at least as of now, unequivocal politically [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=37.64s)]
*  as they have proven to be so far? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=44.0s)]
*  No. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=47.2s)]
*  In fact, you know, I was nervous about the blunt force of the headline of that story, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=50.36s)]
*  which was simply abortion wins elections, because, of course, I understand as a voter, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=55.16s)]
*  as a political writer, as somebody who's looked at this history, that very rarely is there [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=60.959999999999994s)]
*  anything that is quite so unequivocal. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=65.12s)]
*  And that headline really was a blunt force headline. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=67.56s)]
*  And of course, you never know actually what's going to happen in any given election. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=71.42s)]
*  But here we are. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=75.72s)]
*  There have been these seven referendum votes in addition to Supreme Court votes in Wisconsin [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=77.96s)]
*  and Pennsylvania that have relied on abortion. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=83.24s)]
*  There's been the vote in Ohio about whether one could vote in the referendum on Tuesday. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=85.8s)]
*  There have been all these elections. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=90.96s)]
*  And yes, in every case over the past, over the, in the months since I published that [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=91.96s)]
*  story and in fact since Dobbs, in almost every contest, abortion has won. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  But I have to say that I, I think that that blunt force headline was necessary to get [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=101.18s)]
*  through to a Democratic Party that over decades hasn't always felt comfortable running on [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=108.68s)]
*  abortion rights, has treated it as a difficult and controversial issue rather than a very [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=113.36s)]
*  popular issue, which is one of its strengths. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=121.48s)]
*  And so that blunt force headline, abortion wins elections, was meant to get in the head [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=124.44s)]
*  of Democrats. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=128.04s)]
*  And as you pointed out earlier, now we have all this evidence and it is very much in the [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=129.54s)]
*  head of Democrats and Republicans. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=133.44s)]
*  When you detailed some of the challenges ahead for Republicans, how do they, the you [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=135.24s)]
*  broke it, you bought it problem for Republicans, which is they got what they wanted, which [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  is the overturn of Roe, and now they are paying for it in these steady electoral losses. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=144.16s)]
*  And what are they going to do? [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=148.84s)]
*  On the other side of that is the question of what Democrats are going to do, because [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=150.44s)]
*  maybe the bluntness of that equation is getting through. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=154.26000000000002s)]
*  But I think especially going into the 2024 elections, one of the things they have to [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=158.22s)]
*  OK, so abortion may win elections, but you actually have to think about why it's winning. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=163.5s)]
*  You can't just say the word abortion. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=169.10000000000002s)]
*  It took a long time for a lot of Democratic politicians to even be able to utter the word [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=170.98000000000002s)]
*  abortion. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=174.34s)]
*  And now they're going to get better at that. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=176.22000000000003s)]
*  But you can't just say the word over and over and over again without thinking, what is it [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=177.54000000000002s)]
*  here that is driving voters to the polls in this sort of like undeniable surge of Democratic [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  support? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=190.26000000000002s)]
*  What are voters responding to here and really think that through in terms of how they communicate [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=192.0s)]
*  moving into this next year and, in fact, into the years that are to come? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=196.68s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's a really good point. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=200.32s)]
*  I think part of what's so interesting, particularly if you look at Ohio, for instance, I mean, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=202.64000000000001s)]
*  it's very tangible and concrete. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=207.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, it's not sometimes things in politics are very attenuated. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=209.0s)]
*  You're voting for this person and you hope when you put them in, they'll vote the way [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=213.24s)]
*  you want and then maybe they'll pass the tax code or whatever. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  This is like you're going to be able to get an abortion in Ohio or not. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=219.52s)]
*  Like, that's very clear. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=222.96s)]
*  The question on the federal level, which I think is, you know, to play this out, the [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=225.48000000000002s)]
*  Republicans are clearly they have no idea what to do and they're fighting about national [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=229.56s)]
*  blame. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=232.88s)]
*  But it does seem to me like the clear message here is for the Democrats at the federal level [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=233.88s)]
*  in the presidential election is we will vote to protect abortion nationwide. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=237.92000000000002s)]
*  They say Cata Fairo, which I think is a sort of not a great phrase. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=242.64000000000001s)]
*  I think we should come up with something else. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=245.96s)]
*  That seems to me like the clear message here is we will protect abortion rights nationwide. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=247.68s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=252.68s)]
*  And I think that has to be there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=255.68s)]
*  There has to be an exchange. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=257.68s)]
*  As you point out, these referenda have put voters closer to actual policymaking than [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=259.14s)]
*  we get to be in a lot of the in a lot of electoral instances. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=264.92s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=269.2s)]
*  And you go and you know that your vote counts toward protecting a right to access health [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=270.2s)]
*  care. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=276.56s)]
*  Right. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=277.56s)]
*  That is an incredible power, incredibly powerful and motivating feeling. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=278.56s)]
*  And your point as to what has to happen on the federal level and the argument and the [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=281.88s)]
*  deal that that politicians have to put out there for the voters who they want to come [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=285.08s)]
*  vote for them a year from now is your vote is again going to matter when it comes to [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=289.08s)]
*  the reinstatement or protection. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=294.35999999999996s)]
*  And and part of what my story was about in March is that there is not a history of politicians [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=296.76s)]
*  being able to do this legislatively. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=304.08s)]
*  The Supreme Court decision in Roe in 1973 came at just the moment that there was even [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=306.64s)]
*  the beginning of discussion about a federal legislative project to protect and decriminalize [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=312.04s)]
*  abortion. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=317.12s)]
*  And so Democratic politicians on a federal level have a lot of work to do right now to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=318.12s)]
*  think about how they're going to make this policy. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=322.48s)]
*  That's such an important point and a key point in how you're going to message and then deliver [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=325.4s)]
*  you know if you win in this run up the election how you make this you know because it's going [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=330.32s)]
*  to be central in this election. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=335.16s)]
*  And if you you know you can't just talk about it. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=337.12s)]
*  You got to you got to have a plan for people. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=339.32s)]
*  Rebecca Trayster whose piece is worth going back to if you have not yet read it. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=341.0s)]
*  Always great to have you on. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=345.64s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30lcqQxkYx0&t=346.64s)]
