# Chris Hayes: Trump ‘irreparably destroyed’ world order with Zelenskyy blowup
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 28, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today Donald Trump irreparably destroyed the 80-year-old post-World War II international order. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=0.0s)]
*  His total abandonment of Ukraine in front of the cameras was on display for the entire world to see. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=9.0s)]
*  It was a truly historic moment, not in the good way. One that I fear realigned the world order, upending the only foreign policy consensus that most living Americans and Europeans have ever known. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=15.0s)]
*  Today's Oval Office meeting started to turn ugly when Trump apparently thought that Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was not being deferential enough to Russian President Vladimir Putin. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=29.0s)]
*  I really count on your strong position to stop Putin. And you said that enough with the war. I think that is very important, Vin, to say these wars to Putin at the very beginning. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=43.0s)]
*  At the very beginning of war, because he is a killer and terrorist. But I hope that together we can stop him. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=55.0s)]
*  I'm aligned with the world, and I want to get this thing over with. You see the hatred he's got for Putin. It's very tough for me to make a deal with that kind of hatred. He's got tremendous hatred. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=61.0s)]
*  It only got worse from there as Trump and his Vice President lashed out against Zelensky in the Oval Office. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=70.0s)]
*  We're going to play all seven minutes of that exchange. It happened earlier to a lot of people at work, and you've probably seen clips. But the context here is important. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=76.0s)]
*  Everyone should see how the President and Vice President of the United States conducted themselves on the world stage. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=85.0s)]
*  He broke this ceasefire. He killed our people, and he didn't exchange prisoners. We signed the exchange of prisoners, but he didn't do it. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=92.0s)]
*  What kind of diplomacy, JD, you are speaking about? What do you mean? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=102.0s)]
*  I'm talking about the kind of diplomacy that's going to end the destruction of your country. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=108.0s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, with respect, I think it's disrespectful for you to come into the Oval Office and try to litigate this in front of the American media. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=112.0s)]
*  Right now, you guys are going around and forcing conscripts to the front lines because you have manpower problems. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=119.0s)]
*  You should be thanking the President for trying to bring it into this conflict. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=125.0s)]
*  Have you ever been to Ukraine that you say what problems we have? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=129.0s)]
*  I have been to... [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=132.0s)]
*  Count one. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=133.0s)]
*  I've actually watched and seen the stories, and I know what happens is you bring people, you bring them on a propaganda tour, Mr. President. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=134.0s)]
*  Do you disagree that you've had problems bringing people into your military? [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=142.0s)]
*  And do you think that it's respectful to come to the Oval Office of the United States of America and attack the administration that is trying to prevent the destruction of your country? [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=147.0s)]
*  A lot of questions. Let's start from the beginning. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=156.0s)]
*  First of all, during the war, everybody has problems. Even you, but you have a nice ocean and don't feel now, but you will feel it in the future. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=159.0s)]
*  You don't know that. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=169.0s)]
*  God bless. God bless. God bless. You will not have a war. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=170.0s)]
*  Don't tell us what we're going to feel. We're trying to solve a problem. Don't tell us what we're going to feel. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=173.0s)]
*  I'm not telling you. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=178.0s)]
*  Because you're in no position to dictate that. Remember that. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=179.0s)]
*  You're in no position to dictate what we're going to feel. We're going to feel very good. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=182.0s)]
*  We're going to feel very good and very strong. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=188.0s)]
*  You're right now not in a very good position. You've allowed yourself to be in a very bad position, and it happens to be right about now. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=192.0s)]
*  You're not in a good position. You don't have the cards right now. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=200.0s)]
*  With us, you start having cards. Right now, you're not playing cards. You're playing cards. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=204.0s)]
*  You're gambling with the lives of millions of people. You're gambling with World War III. You're gambling with World War III. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=209.0s)]
*  And what you're doing is very disrespectful to the country, this country, that's backed you far more than a lot of people said they should have. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=218.0s)]
*  Have you said thank you once this entire meeting? No. In this entire meeting, have you said thank you? [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=228.0s)]
*  You went to Pennsylvania and campaigned for the opposition in October. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=233.0s)]
*  Offer some words of appreciation for the United States of America and the president who's trying to save your country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=237.0s)]
*  Please. You're saying that if you will speak very loudly about the war, you can speak loudly. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=245.0s)]
*  He's not speaking loudly. He's not speaking loudly. Your country is in big trouble. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=251.0s)]
*  Can I answer? No, no. You've done a lot of talking. Your country is in big trouble. I know. You're not winning. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=255.0s)]
*  You're not winning this. You have a damn good chance of coming out OK because of us. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=261.0s)]
*  Mr. President, we are staying in our country, staying strong from the very beginning of the war. We've been alone and we are thankful. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=266.0s)]
*  I said thanks in this cabinet and ultimately in this cabinet. You haven't been allowed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=272.0s)]
*  We gave you through this stupid president $350 billion. You voted for your president. We gave you military equipment. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=276.0s)]
*  You men are brave, but they had to use our military. What about West? If you didn't have our military equipment, you invited me. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=282.0s)]
*  If you didn't have our military equipment, this war would have been over in two weeks. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=289.0s)]
*  In three days, I heard it from Putin in three days. This is something maybe less in two weeks. Of course. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=294.0s)]
*  Yes, it's going to be a very hard thing to do business like this. I tell you, say thank you. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=299.0s)]
*  I said accept that there are disagreements and let's go litigate those disagreements rather than trying to fight it out in the American media when you're wrong. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=305.0s)]
*  We know that you're wrong. But you see, I think it's good for the American people to see what's going on. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=316.0s)]
*  I think it's very important. That's why I kept this going so long. You have to be thankful. You don't have the cards. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=321.0s)]
*  You're buried there. Your people are dying. You're running low on soldiers. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=328.0s)]
*  Listen, you're running low on soldiers. It would be a damn good thing. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=333.0s)]
*  And then you tell us, I don't want to ceasefire. I don't want to ceasefire. I want to go. And I wanted this. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=337.0s)]
*  Look, if you could get a ceasefire right now, I tell you, you take it so the bullets stop flying and your men stop getting killed. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=343.0s)]
*  Of course we want to stop the war. But you're saying you don't want to ceasefire. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=351.0s)]
*  I want to ceasefire because you'll get a ceasefire faster than an agreement. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=354.0s)]
*  That wasn't with me. That was with a guy named Biden who was not a smart person. That was with Obama. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=361.0s)]
*  Excuse me. That was with Obama who gave you sheets and I gave you javelins. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=370.0s)]
*  I gave you the javelins to take out all those tanks. Obama gave you sheets. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=375.0s)]
*  In fact, the statement is Obama gave sheets and Trump gave javelins. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=381.0s)]
*  You got to be more thankful because let me tell you, you don't have the cards. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=386.0s)]
*  With us, you have the cards. But without us, you don't have any cards. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=391.0s)]
*  It's going to be a tough deal to make because the attitudes have to change. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=399.0s)]
*  What are you saying? [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=412.0s)]
*  She's asking what if Russia breaks the ceasefire? [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=413.0s)]
*  What if anything? What if a bomb drops on your head right now? [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=417.0s)]
*  Okay? What if they broke it? I don't know. They broke it with Biden because Biden, they didn't respect him. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=421.0s)]
*  They didn't respect Obama. They respect me. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=427.0s)]
*  Let me tell you, Putin went through a hell of a lot with me. He went through a phony witch hunt where they used him and Russia. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=431.0s)]
*  Russia, Russia, Russia. You ever hear of that deal? That was a phony. That was a phony Hunter Biden, Joe Biden scam. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=438.0s)]
*  Hillary Clinton, Shifty Adam Schiff. It was a Democrat scam. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=445.0s)]
*  And he had to go through that. And he did go through it. We didn't end up in a war. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=450.0s)]
*  And he went through it. He was accused of all that stuff. He had nothing to do with it. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=455.0s)]
*  It came out of Hunter Biden's bathroom. It came out of Hunter Biden's bedroom. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=459.0s)]
*  It was disgusting. And then they said, oh, oh, the laptop from hell was made by Russia. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=465.0s)]
*  The 51 agents. The whole thing was a scam. And he had to put up with that. He was being accused of all that stuff. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=473.0s)]
*  All I can say is this. He might have broken deals with Obama and Bush, and he might have broken them with Biden. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=480.0s)]
*  He did. Maybe. Maybe he did. I don't know what happened, but he didn't break them with me. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=488.0s)]
*  He wants to make a deal. I don't know if you can make a deal. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=492.0s)]
*  The problem is I've empowered you to be a tough guy. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=495.0s)]
*  And I don't think you'd be a tough guy without the United States. And your people are very brave. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=499.0s)]
*  But you're either going to make a deal or we're out. And if we're out, you'll fight it out. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=505.0s)]
*  I don't think it's going to be pretty, but you'll fight it out. But you don't have the cards. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=511.0s)]
*  But once we sign that deal, you're in a much better position. But you're not acting at all thankful. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=516.0s)]
*  And that's not a nice thing. I'll be honest. That's not a nice thing. All right. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=522.0s)]
*  I think we've seen enough. What do you think? [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=526.0s)]
*  JD Vance accused Zelensky of being disrespectful. You heard the whole exchange. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=536.0s)]
*  What do you think was being disrespectful? [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=542.0s)]
*  I don't think it's hyperbole to say we as a country have never quite seen anything like this particularly appalling spectacle before. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=545.0s)]
*  Once the meeting concluded, President Zelensky was kicked out of the White House without even signing the rare earth mineral deal. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=554.0s)]
*  That's the deal that Trump wanted him to sign. He's been trying to bully him into signing to give away resources. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=562.0s)]
*  It's the deal that Trump kept calling a raw earth deal. Trump wanted him to strong harm him into joining on the deal and signing the deal at the White House today. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=568.0s)]
*  That was the cost of U.S. support. Give us your minerals. We take and then maybe we'll see what we can do for you. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=578.0s)]
*  A planned joint press conference between him and President Trump was abruptly canceled. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=586.0s)]
*  In later remarks to reporters today, Trump let slip the real reason he kicked Zelensky out today. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=590.0s)]
*  He doesn't have to stand there and say about Putin this, Putin that, all negative things. He's got to say I want to make peace. I don't want to fight a war any longer. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=596.0s)]
*  He got upset because he was saying negative things about Donald Trump's buddy, mentor, something else. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=608.0s)]
*  Vladimir Putin. That's what happened. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=621.0s)]
*  Or alternately, another way that today looks to me on its face is that it was a planned ambush to effectively jettison Ukraine and complete the switching of sides of the U.S. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=626.0s)]
*  In line with again, Donald Trump and JD Vance's Russia first views. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=640.0s)]
*  They like Russia. They want the U.S. to be more like Russia. They like Vladimir Putin. They don't like Democratic countries. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=646.0s)]
*  Predictably, Donald Trump's Republican toadies practically tripped over themselves to be the first to lavish praise on this morning's embarrassing display. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=655.0s)]
*  Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who is rather quiet during much of the meeting, sitting there suddenly on the couch, found his voice on social media posting. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=664.0s)]
*  Thank you, POTUS, for standing up for America in a way that no president has ever had the courage to do before. Thank you for putting America first. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=671.0s)]
*  America is with you. [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=677.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, who earlier this month, and I mean like a few weeks ago on tape in front of the whole world, called Zelensky the ally he, quote, been hoping for all my life, is now also apparently on Team Russia. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=681.0s)]
*  If you have been more proud of President Trump for showing the American people in the world, you don't trifle with this man. [[00:11:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=700.0s)]
*  JD was awesome. This is a missed opportunity. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=706.0s)]
*  And the question for me, for the Ukrainian people, I don't know if Zelensky can ever get you to where you want to go with the United States. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=709.0s)]
*  Either he dramatically changes or you need to get somebody new. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=718.0s)]
*  If I were him, I would profusely apologize to the way he treated our president and the vice president and the Oval Office. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=722.0s)]
*  I don't know if you can repair the damage. I don't know if you can ever do a deal with Zelensky anymore. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=729.0s)]
*  Let's be clear here. [[00:12:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=734.0s)]
*  There is a lot, a lot, so much to criticize about the past 80 years of American foreign policy. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=737.0s)]
*  I've been doing a lot of that criticizing myself for most of my time as a professional journalist commentator. [[00:12:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=746.0s)]
*  What Donald Trump is building in its wake right now in front of all of us with these actions, he's doing things, not just words, [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=754.0s)]
*  where the United States partners itself with authoritarian regimes, sides of Vladimir Putin against Democratic allies is undoubtedly worse than what we had before. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=762.0s)]
*  This will have massive consequences for global politics for decades to come. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=776.0s)]
*  The American-European alliance is effectively over. [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=781.0s)]
*  The North Star of the postwar order, where the United States' strongest alliances are with fellow democracies over authoritarian regimes, has ended. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=784.0s)]
*  80 years of diplomacy, born of ashes and 35 million dead, undone by one, one and a half men today. [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=794.0s)]
*  I think it makes America weaker, definitely more vulnerable. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=806.0s)]
*  It is going to make the world more dangerous as a result, no question. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=812.0s)]
*  We're already seeing our European allies scramble to fill the void, leaders from France and Ireland, Latvia, Lithuania, Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Portugal, [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=817.0s)]
*  Spain and Sweden, among others, immediately issued strong statements of support for the Ukrainian people who were invaded and have been shot at and getting killed by Russian soldiers. [[00:13:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=824.0s)]
*  It appears they, too, are waking up to the stark reality that America under Donald Trump will no longer be a leader on the world stage. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZThLlfMvMRY&t=833.0s)]
