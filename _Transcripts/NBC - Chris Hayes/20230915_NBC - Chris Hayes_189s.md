**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ)
*  I truly hate to have to deliver this news, but it appears that Republican Congresswoman [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Lauren Boebert of Colorado has not been honest with us. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=4.24s)]
*  Not with the American people, not with her constituents in Colorado. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=7.8s)]
*  She has lied about what happened to get her ejected from a recent performance of Beetlejuice [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=10.36s)]
*  the musical. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=15.72s)]
*  Earlier in the week, we brought you this story first reported by the folks over the Denver [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=16.72s)]
*  Post. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=20.96s)]
*  On Sunday evening, the Congresswoman and a male companion were escorted out of a downtown [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=21.96s)]
*  Denver theater, quote, accused by venue officials of vaping, singing, recording and, quote, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=26.12s)]
*  causing a disturbance during the performance. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=31.76s)]
*  According to an usher quoted in the theater's incident report, the patrons said they would [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=34.04s)]
*  not leave. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=38.04s)]
*  I told them I would be going to get the Denver police. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=39.04s)]
*  They said, go get them. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=41.24s)]
*  The Congresswoman seriously downplayed the situation after this news broke, posting she, [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=43.480000000000004s)]
*  quote, pleads guilty to laughing and singing too loud, hand covering mouth emoji. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=48.16s)]
*  Our campaign manager took it even further, confirming that he called the stunning and [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=52.84s)]
*  salacious rumors that Boebert is indeed a supporter of the performing arts gasp who [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=56.36000000000001s)]
*  enthusiastically enjoy the performance. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=60.080000000000005s)]
*  Well, thanks to the good folks at Nine News in Denver, we now have the security footage [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=62.440000000000005s)]
*  from inside that theater. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=67.88000000000001s)]
*  Take a look at their investigation into what really happened. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=69.9s)]
*  Boebert, Boebert, Boebert say it three times and she appears in security video from a weekend [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=73.44s)]
*  performance of Beetlejuice, where the Congresswoman was kicked out of the theater for being disruptive. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=80.9s)]
*  The DCPA says she was vaping. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=84.74000000000001s)]
*  Boebert's team denied that, said the haze was from fog machines in the show. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=87.26s)]
*  That claim goes up in smoke when you see the video. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=91.14s)]
*  The pregnant woman sitting behind Boebert told the Denver Post she asked her to stop [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=93.78s)]
*  vaping and Boebert refused. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=97.14000000000001s)]
*  Her one-woman show continued, taking flash photos, raising her hands and dancing, often [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=99.60000000000001s)]
*  the only one clapping or standing up in the crowd. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=104.54s)]
*  Boebert occasionally took a break from being disruptive to enjoy the company of her male [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=107.3s)]
*  companion. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=110.7s)]
*  He briefly had a grasp on the situation before ushers returned and told Boebert she had to [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=111.74s)]
*  leave. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=116.7s)]
*  The theater's incident report says Boebert pulled the don't you know who I am card on [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=117.7s)]
*  the way out, giving theater employees the single finger salute. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=121.3s)]
*  Now, we're sparing you the details of the more R-rated behavior Boebert and her friend [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=125.3s)]
*  engaged in. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=129.62s)]
*  You can find that on the internet if you zoom in on some of that surveillance footage if [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=130.62s)]
*  you're interested. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=133.4s)]
*  At the Beetlejuice musical. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=134.52s)]
*  I don't think it's a good look going into a re-election campaign against a Democratic [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=137.32s)]
*  challenger who remember Boebert barely barely beat in 2022. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=140.88s)]
*  It was the surprise race of the midterms. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=145.72s)]
*  Last November, that man, Democrat Adam Frisch, came within 600 votes of unseating Lauren [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=148.64000000000001s)]
*  Boebert and Frisch is running against her again and so far this year he has been out [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=153.32s)]
*  fundraising her. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=157.06s)]
*  It's fair to say a good number of the residents of Colorado's third district were already [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=158.72s)]
*  embarrassed by their elected representative. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=162.48s)]
*  Well before Beetlejuice. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zxZCn7-1CQ&t=165.0s)]
