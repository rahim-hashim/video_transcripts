# Chris Hayes: Control is now a pillar of the Republican vision
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 19, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Ron DeSantis' state of Florida is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=0.0s)]
*  forcing a kind of torture on its residents. That's not my conclusion. It's [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=4.04s)]
*  not my word, in fact. The word comes from Florida resident Peter Rogel. He's a [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=8.6s)]
*  Catholic father of seven, a grandfather of 17, who had to watch his daughter [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=13.92s)]
*  endure unimaginable horror at the hands of the state, which has banned most [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=18.8s)]
*  abortions. As Rogel told The Washington Post, quote, to me, it's just pure torture. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=23.96s)]
*  The law has created torture. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=29.92s)]
*  This is what Ron DeSantis has forced upon this family. Deborah and Lee [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=32.84s)]
*  Dorbert, Peter's daughter and son-in-law, learned 23 weeks into her [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=37.2s)]
*  pregnancy that their child had a condition called Potter syndrome that is [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=40.84s)]
*  incompatible with life. The baby did not develop kidneys and was suffering from [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=44.92s)]
*  a series of other abnormalities of the heart and stomach due to a lack of [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=49.760000000000005s)]
*  amniotic fluid. Potter syndrome also causes underdeveloped lungs and babies [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=53.52s)]
*  who survive to delivery are born unable to breathe. Typically they suffocate [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=58.48s)]
*  within minutes to hours after birth. After receiving that diagnosis, Deborah [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=64.11999999999999s)]
*  and Lee decided they wanted to terminate the pregnancy. Quote, But as [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=69.28s)]
*  long as there's babies, heart kept beating, doctor would not honor their [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=74.0s)]
*  request. Now, current law in Florida that bans abortions of 15 weeks does [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=77.44s)]
*  have an exception for fetal fatal abnormalities, but the doctors wouldn't [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=82.44s)]
*  say how they reached their decision. The key thing, though, here, and we've seen [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=89.6s)]
*  this in state after state that have so called exceptions, is the law carries [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=92.52s)]
*  severe penalties, including prison time for medical practitioners who run afoul [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=96.16s)]
*  of it. So what do you think is going to happen? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=100.44s)]
*  So the doorbirds weren't allowed to terminate the pregnancy. They did not [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=104.03999999999999s)]
*  have control of that decision. That decision was in the hands of Ron DeSantis, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=107.96s)]
*  and they had to wait. They do wait 3.5 months until Deborah was close to full [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=111.68s)]
*  term to have labor induced. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=117.24s)]
*  We've pretty much made a plan for everything at this point, knowing I have [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=120.98s)]
*  to carry to full term. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=125.64s)]
*  So we kind of have come to accept that. I mean, we don't have any choice, but [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=130.68s)]
*  to accept those terms. It's exhausting. Just the anxiety and the depression and, [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=138.0s)]
*  you know, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=147.92s)]
*  carrying a baby and knowing what's about to happen. It's mentally, it's [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=150.0s)]
*  challenging. And then just my four year old, he doesn't see the same mommy all [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=158.4s)]
*  the time because I break down crying. He's wiping my eyes and tell me it's [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=166.32s)]
*  okay. So I know it's probably hard on him seeing me sad. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=171.24s)]
*  Deborah recalled when she finally made it to 37 weeks that they sat down with [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=177.52s)]
*  their son, who saw their Kaden, to explain the baby's body had stopped [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=181.16s)]
*  working and that he would not come home. Instead, some day they told Kaden they [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=184.96s)]
*  would all meet his angels. The four year old burst into tears, telling them he [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=189.44s)]
*  did not want to be an angel. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=193.32s)]
*  On March 3rd, after 12 hours of labor, [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=195.64s)]
*  Deborah gave birth to her second son, Milo. He was four pounds, 12 ounces, and [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=199.83999999999997s)]
*  he did not cry or open his eyes. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=204.2s)]
*  But when they pulled the baby on out, I thought my miracle happened. I thought [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=207.04s)]
*  because the baby was [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=211.2s)]
*  perfect for me. And then I realized once Debbie had it to me that the baby was [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=214.32s)]
*  doing hiccups. I call it hiccups. And finally I realized after about five, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=222.35999999999999s)]
*  10 minutes that it wasn't hiccups. It was gasping for air. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=227.44s)]
*  Milo lived for just 99 minutes. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=231.96s)]
*  If you got to take a second of this story, I understand because it's [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=235.28s)]
*  so devastating. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=240.0s)]
*  Too much to handle. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=242.4s)]
*  Just one story. This is just one story. Big state Florida, from this family that [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=244.4s)]
*  was so brave to tell it. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=248.92s)]
*  But we know there are many others, innumerable others like it that we don't [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=252.32s)]
*  know, that we haven't heard about it. And there will be many more in Florida and [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=256.52s)]
*  in all of the states that have adopted the Republican vision of control of [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=260.8s)]
*  people's bodies and their families. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=264.56s)]
*  They are taking away the very values they claim to uphold, like freedom and [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=267.64s)]
*  choice, as Deborah Dorbert explains. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=271.76s)]
*  You say we live in the land of freedom and making choices for ourselves, but [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=274.96s)]
*  yet I can't right now. I can't make a choice [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=281.44s)]
*  for what's best for me, this baby, my family. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=286.92s)]
*  Now, we know that story thanks to some phenomenal reporting from The Washington [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=291.92s)]
*  Post, all those interviews, that footage all from The Washington Post that told [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=295.08s)]
*  this one story of what it looks like when the Republican vision of control [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=299.12s)]
*  happens to your family in a moment of crisis. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=304.8s)]
*  Control is now a pillar of the Republican vision. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=307.32s)]
*  It does not stop at pregnancy in women's bodies. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=310.08s)]
*  No. In Florida, public expressions and LGBTQ pride are now under threat. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  Today, organizers canceled a Tampa Pride event in the wake of Ron DeSantis' [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=318.12s)]
*  expansion of the so-called Don't Say Gay Law. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=323.16s)]
*  The legislation now allows the state to fine, suspend or revoke the license of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=326.71999999999997s)]
*  any establishment if the establishment admits a child to an adult live [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=331.56s)]
*  performance. Now, while the text does not specifically mention drag [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=336.24s)]
*  performances, a handout from the Governor's News Conference Wednesday stated [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  that drag shows are considered live performances, quote, without serious [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=343.91999999999996s)]
*  literary, artistic, political or scientific value for the age of the child [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=347.71999999999997s)]
*  present, as the law describes it. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=351.96s)]
*  Because drag queens perform in the open at the Tampa Pride Festival, well, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=354.79999999999995s)]
*  organizers worried, understandably, they could be violating the new law. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=358.15999999999997s)]
*  So no pride parade now in the free state of Florida. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=362.67999999999995s)]
*  And this comes on the heels of the report we brought you last night about the [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=367.28s)]
*  impact of another law Ron DeSantis signed this week banning gender-referring [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=370.08s)]
*  health care for children. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=373.76s)]
*  You don't get to choose what kind of health care your kid gets. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=376.28s)]
*  Ron DeSantis chooses, just like he chooses to keep you pregnant for 12 [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=379.12s)]
*  weeks. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=384.84s)]
*  To deliver a baby, you know, will die. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=387.2s)]
*  And these laws, as. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=391.12s)]
*  Gothic as they are in their effects are what Ron DeSantis is going to run on [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=394.44s)]
*  in his soon to be officially declared presidential campaign. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=400.52s)]
*  And that is no surprise, because control over your body, your self-expression, [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=403.64s)]
*  gender identity, your children, your family. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=408.56s)]
*  That's what the Republican Party has been obsessed with in the last few years, [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=411.52s)]
*  particularly all over the country and every state where they have political [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=415.32s)]
*  power. This is the priority, controlling those things. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=417.68s)]
*  Just look where Republicans have passed bans on abortion and on gender-affirming [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=420.96s)]
*  care for minors. Did those look similar to you? [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=426.24s)]
*  Yes, they are nearly the same map. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=428.36s)]
*  And that is because they are all part of the same political project of control. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=431.64s)]
*  The goal is to control how and when you give birth, what your family looks like, [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=436.12s)]
*  how it can love, how you and your children can express themselves. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=441.08s)]
*  In fact, to make my point as clear as possible, just hours ago in Nebraska, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=445.48s)]
*  lawmakers in the Republican dominated legislature voted on a bill where they [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=452.28s)]
*  just cut to the chase and merged together two of their main goals into one bill [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=456.56s)]
*  restricting access to abortion, a statewide abortion ban and care for [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=461.15999999999997s)]
*  transgender minors. They put it all in one deadly package, as Democratic state [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=464.8s)]
*  Senator Michaela Kavanaugh told her conservative colleagues. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=469.36s)]
*  Women will die. Children are dying. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=473.56s)]
*  It is your fault. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=476.24s)]
*  It is your fault. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=478.6s)]
*  And you are allowing it to happen. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=480.56s)]
*  You do literally have blood on your hands. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=483.64s)]
*  And if you vote for this, you will have buckets and buckets of blood on your [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=486.64s)]
*  hands. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=491.24s)]
*  That bill passed 33 to 15. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=493.08s)]
*  The Republican governor has said that he will sign it. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1BuiHZh4FRw&t=494.68s)]
