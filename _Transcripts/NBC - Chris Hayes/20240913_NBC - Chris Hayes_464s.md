# 'Every little bit can help' Harris looks to gain ground in red areas of Pennsylvania
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM)
*  Kamala Harris is in Pennsylvania tonight, which may very well be the most important tipping [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=0.0s)]
*  point state in this year's election. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=5.88s)]
*  Vice President spoke to a crowd of thousands in Wilkes-Barre. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=7.92s)]
*  It's a former coal mining town in Luzerne County, a place Donald Trump won by more than [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=10.52s)]
*  14 points in 2020. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=15.16s)]
*  However, crucially, his margin 2020 was slimmer than it was in 2016, when Trump defeated Hillary [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=16.56s)]
*  Clinton by 19 points. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=22.04s)]
*  And that, keeping that trend going, is the formula for statewide success in Pennsylvania. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=24.34s)]
*  Kamala Harris needs to keep her attention on places like Wilkes-Barre, where she is not [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=29.56s)]
*  going to win outright, but she could lose by less than her predecessor did. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=33.24s)]
*  And every little bit can help Harris get over the top and win the all-important state. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=37.84s)]
*  Austin Davis is the Democratic Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=43.2s)]
*  Charlie Dent is a former Pennsylvania congressman, now a senior advisor at Our Republican Legacy, [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=46.2s)]
*  an initiative to bring back traditional Republican principles. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=51.519999999999996s)]
*  And they both join me now. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=54.72s)]
*  Lieutenant Governor, let me start with you, because you are on a ticket with Governor [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=56.08s)]
*  Josh Shapiro in 2022 that really ran a 57-county strategy in the Commonwealth, and it paid [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=58.88s)]
*  off in those margins in lots of counties in which your ticket didn't outright win but [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=67.52000000000001s)]
*  shaved those margins. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=73.60000000000001s)]
*  How important is it to get out around the state for the Democratic ticket? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=75.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, thank you, Chris, for having me today. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=81.36s)]
*  It's great to be with you. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=84.44s)]
*  It's 67 counties here in Pennsylvania. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=86.24000000000001s)]
*  And it's critically important, because you can't win with just Democrats alone here in [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=88.12s)]
*  Pennsylvania. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=92.84s)]
*  You have to build a coalition of Democrats, Republicans and independents to win this state. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=93.84s)]
*  And so you can't just rely on big cities like Philadelphia and Pittsburgh to carry you across [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=99.6s)]
*  the finish line. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=105.0s)]
*  You have to go to counties where it may not be easy to be a Democrat at times, and you [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=106.0s)]
*  have to talk to those voters and connect with them and talk about how we're going to make [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=111.6s)]
*  their lives better. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=115.52s)]
*  And that's exactly what Josh Shapiro and I did in our campaign for governor and lieutenant [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=117.4s)]
*  governor. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=121.44s)]
*  And you're seeing Vice President Harris do that with her stops in Wilkes-Barre and Johnstown [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=122.44s)]
*  today. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=127.2s)]
*  You have to make sure you get out in these counties, because we know this election is [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=128.2s)]
*  going to be closed. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=132.4s)]
*  The last presidential election was decided by less than a percentage point. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=133.4s)]
*  And in a scenario like that, the margins really do matter. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=137.08s)]
*  Charlie, the vice president sat down with a local affiliate, I think outside Philadelphia [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=141.0s)]
*  today or Philadelphia affiliate while she was in the state and gave an interview. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=148.4s)]
*  And she sort of hit this central theme that I think is part there's a sort of substantive [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=152.4s)]
*  appeals to folks in the center who may not be Democrats. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=157.16s)]
*  And then there's a kind of thematic rhetorical one, which I think has been central. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=159.6s)]
*  We saw in the debate. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=164.04s)]
*  I want you to take a listen and tell me what you think. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=165.04s)]
*  This is Kamala Harris speaking to a local reporter in Pennsylvania. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=166.6s)]
*  In my heart, I know in my soul, I know that the vast majority of us as Americans have [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=172.0s)]
*  so much more in common on what separates us. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=177.6s)]
*  And I also believe that I am accurate in knowing that most Americans want a leader who brings [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=181.07999999999998s)]
*  us together as Americans and not someone who professes to be a leader who is trying to [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=188.51999999999998s)]
*  have us point our fingers at each other. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=195.6s)]
*  I think people are exhausted with that approach, to be honest with you. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=199.12s)]
*  What do you think about the exhausted line, the sort of uniter, not divider approach, [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=201.96s)]
*  Charlie? [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=207.64000000000001s)]
*  Well, I think that type of message will resonate. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=208.64000000000001s)]
*  I do think that people do get frustrated with Donald Trump because of his own personal grievances. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=212.36s)]
*  They're exhausted with all of his complaints about January 6th. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=218.08s)]
*  And now he's getting off on tangents on our people eating, immigrants eating pets in [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=222.24s)]
*  Springfield, Ohio. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=227.24s)]
*  They're tired and exhausted with it. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=228.60000000000002s)]
*  So I think that's actually that's a message that resonates. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=230.0s)]
*  And Chris, I do need to point out, and I agree with Governor Davis, that there are 67 counties [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=233.52s)]
*  in Pennsylvania. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  And between 2016 and 2020, Donald Trump did marginally worse in 66 out of 67 counties [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=239.88s)]
*  from 2016 to 2020. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=246.64000000000001s)]
*  He did worse. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=249.28s)]
*  One of the county he did marginally better in was Philadelphia. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=250.32s)]
*  That's right. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=254.0s)]
*  He was beaten badly there, but he did a little bit better there. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=255.0s)]
*  But every other county is where his margin slipped. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=258.36s)]
*  And I think the Harris campaign is trying to maybe take a little bit of a page out of [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=261.12s)]
*  the Biden playbook in Pennsylvania, where you try to shave down the margins in all these [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=264.56s)]
*  other states because the Democrats will lose most of the counties by a considerable margin. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=268.8s)]
*  But they'll win the big counties with the big population centers. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=273.24s)]
*  And that's where the game is. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=276.8s)]
*  But they have to go to Wilkes-Barre and Johnstowns and other places like that where they're going [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=278.2s)]
*  to lose, but maybe by a little less. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=281.84s)]
*  Lieutenant Governor, I wanted to talk to you about something that... [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=283.24s)]
*  Yeah, go ahead. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=286.56s)]
*  No, I was going to say, just to jump in there, I think, you know, we as Democrats have to [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=287.56s)]
*  go to places where it's not comfortable to be Democrats. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=292.48s)]
*  We have to compete in every community. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=295.44s)]
*  We can't leave any community behind. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=297.76s)]
*  And I think particularly as a party, we haven't focused enough on rural communities. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=299.91999999999996s)]
*  And I think that's what Josh Shapiro and I have been doing. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=304.8s)]
*  I think that's what we're seeing Vice President Harris do. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=307.08000000000004s)]
*  Let me ask you this, just to follow up with you. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=311.12s)]
*  On it is so it's a little strange, we have to say. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=312.72s)]
*  I understand that fracking has been a large driver of industry in Pennsylvania. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=316.32s)]
*  It's been central a bunch of people. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  There's a weird way in which like Pennsylvania equals the issue of fracking is this kind [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=324.64000000000004s)]
*  of like conventional political wisdom that I just have a hard time squaring the math on. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=330.56s)]
*  There's twenty six, thirty five thousand people that have jobs in the industry. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=335.16s)]
*  There's 13 million people in the state. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=339.56s)]
*  I understand it's important to some folks. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=341.20000000000005s)]
*  Do you think fracking is central to the minds of voters in Pennsylvania, Lieutenant Governor? [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=343.12s)]
*  And then I'll ask you, Charlie. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=348.68s)]
*  Yeah, look, I think overall, Pennsylvania is a big industrial state. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=350.44000000000005s)]
*  We're an energy producing state. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=354.56s)]
*  And I think folks are concerned about their jobs and their family's economic well-being. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=356.76000000000005s)]
*  They're concerned about the jobs that they have today being there tomorrow. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=361.28s)]
*  And so I think when people talk about fracking, I think it encompasses a lot of that. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=365.24s)]
*  And I think many times Democrats have not necessarily embraced an all the above energy [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=369.28s)]
*  strategy and folks in particularly communities like mine in the Mon Valley region of Allegheny [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=373.84s)]
*  County, those big steel country have seen jobs leave and they know how that devastates [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=379.0s)]
*  a community. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=384.12s)]
*  And so folks want to continue to see a bright economic future and they want a leader who's [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=385.28s)]
*  going to fight for that future. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=389.8s)]
*  I think Kamala Harris has demonstrated that she's that leader. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=390.88s)]
*  What I would add is that the fracking and the natural gas industry really does speak [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=396.88s)]
*  to the industrial heritage of Pennsylvania. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=402.2s)]
*  Steel, coal, cement. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=404.44s)]
*  This is a state that has been known for basic industry and energy. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=406.2s)]
*  And so I think it's absolutely a front of mind issue to a lot of a lot of Pennsylvanians. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  And I think it's something to where Donald Trump is making hay out of it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=415.24s)]
*  But Harris had to get herself adjusted on that issue because it speaks to a lot of working [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=420.28000000000003s)]
*  Americans who can identify with that industry. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=425.48s)]
*  And Pennsylvania, by the way, we're the second largest natural gas producing state in the [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=427.44s)]
*  nation. And we've helped change. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=431.96000000000004s)]
*  We, Pennsylvania, have helped change the dynamics of energy throughout the world. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=434.0s)]
*  And so I think many Pennsylvanians are aware of the impact that is not just in America, [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=437.8s)]
*  but throughout the world. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlKTRFuc-OM&t=442.28000000000003s)]
