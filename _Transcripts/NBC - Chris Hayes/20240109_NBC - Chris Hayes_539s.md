# ‘Ludicrous’: Hear the ‘strangest’ argument from Trump’s immunity hearing
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 09, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU)
*  I think the strangest argument that Donald Trump's lawyer kept making today was this notion that somehow a president who is not [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=0.0s)]
*  Impeached and convicted by the Senate cannot be prosecuted now [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=7.08s)]
*  I gotta say as far as I can tell this is an argument they appeared of basically invented [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=10.44s)]
*  Whole cloth in the last like 24 hours and you can hear the skepticism for the judges [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=15.96s)]
*  I've asked you a series of hypotheticals about [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  Criminal actions that could be taken by a president and could be considered official acts and [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=25.959999999999997s)]
*  Asked you would such a president be subject to criminal prosecution if he's not impeached or convicted [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=33.28s)]
*  And your answer your yes or no answer is no. I believe I said qualified. Yes, if he's impeaching convicted first [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=39.4s)]
*  Okay, so he's not impeached or conviction and convicted. Let's put that aside [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=46.92s)]
*  You're saying a president could [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=50.8s)]
*  Sell pardons could sell military secrets could order SEAL Team six to assessing a political rival [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=52.919999999999995s)]
*  Okay, so the argument just you're trying that the argument that Trump's lawyer came back to time and time again [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  Was that the only way that you could? [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=65.64s)]
*  Under the Constitution prosecute a hypothetical president for doing all those hypothetical crimes would be if first [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=68.44s)]
*  While he was president [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=75.56s)]
*  He was impeached and convicted by a two-thirds vote in the Senate [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=77.67999999999999s)]
*  Now there are a bunch of reasons why the argument is ludicrous [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=80.92s)]
*  Not the least of which is that when the ex-president was being impeached the second time [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=83.04s)]
*  One of the arguments made for acquittal was that impeachment wasn't the right venue [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=88.12s)]
*  Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell argued at length. It wasn't the Senate's job to hold Trump accountable [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=93.92s)]
*  That's what prosecutors and courts are for [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=99.72s)]
*  President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office didn't get away with anything yet [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=103.44s)]
*  We have a criminal justice system in this country [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=109.52000000000001s)]
*  We have civil litigation and former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=113.12s)]
*  Lisa Rubin's a former litigator now an MSNBC legal analyst Charles Coleman prosecuted civil cases on behalf of the US government [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=121.44000000000001s)]
*  He's now a civil rights and criminal defense attorney. They both join me now great to have you here. Okay first just [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=127.60000000000001s)]
*  Give me your first read on the centrality of this [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=133.28s)]
*  Argument the you have to impeach and convict first argument as it appeared today [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  Which I was not anticipating to be as central as it was well [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=142.17999999999998s)]
*  That's because it's not their first line argument right the argument that they're making on presidential immunity starts with the overarching [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=144.85999999999999s)]
*  He's immune from everything because of the structure of the Constitution and separation of powers principles [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=151.89999999999998s)]
*  This was their sort of like second line [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=157.5s)]
*  Correct the impeachment judgment clause of article one of the Constitution [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=160.88s)]
*  Which is really intended to be a limit on the Senate and essentially what it says is if you impeach and convict someone [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=166.0s)]
*  the penalties that you can impose upon them are [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=173.12s)]
*  Disqualification from holding office and removal from office and nothing further [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=176.56s)]
*  But nevertheless nothing should prevent that person from also being liable in a court of law [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=180.64s)]
*  There's nothing in that text that says anything about what avenues of relief are open for example to the Department of Justice [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=185.94s)]
*  Which is not addressed in article one [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=193.38s)]
*  This is meant as a constraint on Congress not a get-out-of-jail free card for a former president and in that way Chris [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=195.42000000000002s)]
*  They sort of back their way. Yes this argument. I could very much happening. It was like [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=202.48000000000002s)]
*  Because as Lisa said this is a clause in the Constitution that is supposed to limit Congress limit this [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=209.66s)]
*  Not give the president more power [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=216.18s)]
*  However, one of the things that I have found so interesting about this entire ordeal was I've been wondering going into today [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=218.78s)]
*  Where are they going to create an actual constitutional question that could potentially make its way to the high court? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=226.42000000000002s)]
*  They didn't do it [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=233.02s)]
*  I was I was looking to see whether in pushing on the separation of powers issue [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=234.14000000000001s)]
*  They would create enough controversy that it might pose a legitimate question for the Supreme Court [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=239.6s)]
*  I don't think that they did that so here's what I think a very smart lawyer [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=244.06s)]
*  I talked to about this today made this point which which was clarifying for me because I was like what's up with all the impeachment [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=247.54s)]
*  Stuff and she said look it's a fallback position, right? [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=252.42000000000002s)]
*  Because what they actually want to argue what they've argued in the briefs is you can't do anything, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=255.5s)]
*  If it's an official act tough tough luck, buddy [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=260.58s)]
*  Which means if he sells seal team six to go assassinate his political rival now, they couldn't argue [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=263.5s)]
*  Because it's so ludicrous so now they've got this this fallback impeachment position, I just want to it's just worth playing [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=271.26s)]
*  Because this is a classic Trump thing like in one venue the argument is like well [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=278.5s)]
*  This is the venue and then the then you go to the other venue like well, that's it's not the it's not the venue now [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=282.29999999999995s)]
*  Right, they'd love to do this. Here's Trump's lawyer during impeachment [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=286.79999999999995s)]
*  Assuring the senators look if this doesn't if this if you go to vote for convict [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=291.78s)]
*  He can of course go get arrested and get convicted take a listen [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=296.62s)]
*  If my colleagues on this side of the chamber [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=300.97999999999996s)]
*  Actually think that president Trump committed a criminal offense and let's understand a high crime is a felony and a misdemeanor is a misdemeanor [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=305.06s)]
*  The words haven't changed that much over the time [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=312.74s)]
*  After he's out of office you go and arrest him there is no such thing as a January exception to impeachment [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=317.21999999999997s)]
*  There is only the text of the Constitution which makes very clear [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=324.78s)]
*  That a former president is subject to criminal sanction after his presidency [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=329.46s)]
*  For any illegal acts he commits [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=335.66s)]
*  That's Donald Trump's lawyer at the impeachment hearing making [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=338.82s)]
*  Literally the opposite argument that his lawyer made today before these judges [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=343.3s)]
*  Yes, and one of the reasons it's also specious is because this impeachment judgment clause [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=347.02s)]
*  It doesn't just apply to presidents [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=352.52s)]
*  It applies to anybody who could be impeached by the House and Senate that means former federal judges for example or cabinet secretaries [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=354.46000000000004s)]
*  Some of those people have been prosecuted and convicted without impeachment [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=362.14000000000004s)]
*  Hello, Henry Cisneros the former HUD secretary and there are litany of federal judges [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=365.98s)]
*  Who have been prosecuted and convicted either without impeachment or before they're impeached? [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=371.6s)]
*  So Trump's lawyers had to have known that during the impeachment debacle that you just showed there [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=376.42s)]
*  They understand full well that the impeachment judgment clause isn't just about the president and those real-life examples show why it can't possibly be victorious here [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=382.66s)]
*  I guess the question for you, right? So I thought you went when when the impeachment thing showed up in the brief, right? [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=391.3s)]
*  So in their brief they had this again [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=396.46s)]
*  I mean, it's a little like taking a shot from 36 feet like, you know, if you hit it great [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=398.3s)]
*  But like you got to try right? [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=402.34s)]
*  So it's like they have this thing about like it's double jeopardy because he was always already impeached and wasn't convicted and so criminal trial [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=404.04s)]
*  That's like that's sort of fallen by the wayside a little bit, but they've refashioned it [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=409.86s)]
*  I guess my feeling was like are they trying to come up with something novel enough that SCOTUS will take it [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=413.46000000000004s)]
*  I think it's so out of nowhere, right this entire [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=418.6s)]
*  Ordeal around impeachment this entire question this entire appeal is the shot from 36 feet. It's actually [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=422.54s)]
*  It's actually the half-court shot really like if it goes in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=428.42s)]
*  Yeah at any point for any reason you take it you take it [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=431.14s)]
*  And I think that the more that you can jam pack into that you may get a line it might be what we refer to [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=435.26000000000005s)]
*  As dicta in an opinion that you try to sort of ride and dick there's something that a judge might say that's not necessarily [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=440.46000000000004s)]
*  Germane to the case but as part of a decision [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=445.58000000000004s)]
*  They're looking for something that they can hang their hat on some door some avenue some crack that they're gonna be able to open [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=448.5s)]
*  That's controversial enough that they feel like it's going to generate a legitimate question for another appeal for more delay [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=455.02000000000004s)]
*  Okay, can I ask you a quick question on timing? Yeah that Harry teased right? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=461.76s)]
*  There's a back-and-forth about the possibility of some sort of remand. What did you make of that? [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=465.8s)]
*  Well, I think it's because in the civil context this same court recently decided an appeal with respect to three cases brought by former [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=470.88s)]
*  police officers members of Congress who have sued Trump civilly and in that case and [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=480.12s)]
*  You know the civil rule is that a president does have immunity within the outer perimeter of his official duties [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  Because of that they sent it back to the lower court to determine well [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=492.04s)]
*  What was he doing here was he acting in his official capacity or some personal capacity? [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=495.24s)]
*  That makes sense where you're talking about the civil rule [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=500.08000000000004s)]
*  But here the court has to fashion a rule in the first place right judge [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=502.98s)]
*  Chuckins lower court decision says there is no criminal immunity of any kind [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=506.04s)]
*  So it's unclear whether they'll need to remand at all and they're supposed to take these facts as true [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=511.24s)]
*  All right, Charles Coleman Lisa Rubin. That was great. Thank you [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AV-d6u6Z8oU&t=516.48s)]
