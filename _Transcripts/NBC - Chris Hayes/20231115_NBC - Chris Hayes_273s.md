# Biden says he’s ‘mildly hopeful’ about hostage release deal, urging 'two-state solution'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 15, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ)
*  Israel's war in Gaza has killed more than 11,000 Palestinians just over a month and [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=0.0s)]
*  created a humanitarian disaster. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=6.28s)]
*  Israeli officials have said this work for months or even years. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=9.0s)]
*  Have you communicated to Prime Minister Netanyahu any sort of deadline or timeframe for how [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=12.72s)]
*  long you are willing to support Israel in this operation? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=17.44s)]
*  Are you comfortable with the operation going on indefinitely? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=20.76s)]
*  And is there any deal underway to free Haas? [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=23.62s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=26.2s)]
*  Yes, no, working backwards, forward. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=28.2s)]
*  Look, I have been deeply involved in moving on the hostage negotiation. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=32.04s)]
*  And I don't want to get ahead of myself here because I don't know what's happened in [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=39.28s)]
*  the last four hours. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=46.04s)]
*  But I have gotten great cooperation from Qataris. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=47.04s)]
*  I've spoken with them as well a number of times. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=53.84s)]
*  I think the pause that Israelis have agreed to is down to, I'm getting too much detail. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=59.6s)]
*  I know, Mr. Secretary, I'm going to stop. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=68.80000000000001s)]
*  But I am mildly hopeful. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=72.16s)]
*  I'm mildly hopeful. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=75.88s)]
*  With regard to when is this going to stop? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=78.7s)]
*  I think it's going to stop when Hamas no longer maintains the capacity to murder and abuse [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=83.3s)]
*  and just do horrific things to the Israelis. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=92.3s)]
*  And they're in, and they still think, at least as of this point, they still thought they [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=100.18s)]
*  could. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=104.86s)]
*  I guess the best way for me to say it is that I take a look. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=106.26s)]
*  The IDF, the Israeli Defense Forces, acknowledges they have an obligation to use as much caution [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=116.94s)]
*  as they can in going after their targets. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=126.98s)]
*  It's not like they're rushing to the hospital knocking down doors and pulling people aside [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=129.38s)]
*  and shooting people indiscriminately. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=135.1s)]
*  But Hamas, as I said, said they plan on attacking Israelis again. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=139.3s)]
*  And this is a terrible dilemma. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=144.82s)]
*  So what do you do? [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=149.74s)]
*  I think that Israel is also taking risks themselves about their folks being killed one to one [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=151.86s)]
*  going through these hospital rooms, hospital halls. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=159.42000000000002s)]
*  But one thing has been established is that Hamas does have headquarters, weapons, materiel [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=163.54s)]
*  below this hospital. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=171.5s)]
*  And I suspect others. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=173.34s)]
*  But how long it's going to last, I don't know. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=175.29999999999998s)]
*  Look, I've made it clear to the Israelis that Dabibi enters war cabinet. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=178.62s)]
*  But I think the only ultimate answer here is a two-state solution that's real. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=189.29999999999998s)]
*  We got to get to the point where there is an ability to be able to even talk without [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=194.54s)]
*  worrying about whether or not we're just dealing with, they're dealing with Hamas that's going [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=200.34s)]
*  to engage in the same activities they did over the past, on the 7th. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=205.22s)]
*  So it's, but I can't tell, I'm not a fortune teller, I can't tell you how long it's going [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=211.14s)]
*  to last. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=215.45999999999998s)]
*  I can tell you, I don't think it only ends until there's a two-state solution. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=216.46s)]
*  I've made it clear to the Israelis, I think it's a big mistake for them to think they're [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=221.1s)]
*  going to occupy Gaza and maintain Gaza. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=224.70000000000002s)]
*  I don't think that works. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=227.74s)]
*  And so we're going to, I think you're going to see efforts to bring along. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=229.66s)]
*  Well, I shouldn't go in anymore because that's been things I've been negotiating with Arab [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=234.82s)]
*  countries and others about what the next steps are. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=239.62s)]
*  But anyway, thank you all very much. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=243.62s)]
*  Appreciate it very much. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=246.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=247.34s)]
*  This ends the press conference. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=83o-1e39BDQ&t=248.34s)]
