# Netanyahu rules out ceasefire until Hamas frees hostages despite U.S. pressure
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today America's top diplomat, Secretary of State [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=0.0s)]
*  Antony Blinken flew to Israel for a second time in two and a half weeks where he met with Israeli [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=4.48s)]
*  war cabinet. That's the new unity government war cabinet. And there he called for a humanitarian [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=9.68s)]
*  pause to the conflict in Gaza. We need to do more to protect Palestinian civilians. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=15.6s)]
*  We've been clear that as Israel conducts its campaign to defeat Hamas, how it does so matters. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=23.68s)]
*  I've seen images too of Palestinian children, young boys and girls pulled from the wreckage [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=29.44s)]
*  of buildings. When I see that, when I look into their eyes through the TV screen, [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=36.64s)]
*  I see my own children. How can we not? Following those remarks from the U.S. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=46.8s)]
*  Secretary of State, two things happened. In a brief address to the nation, Israeli Prime Minister [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=53.040000000000006s)]
*  Benjamin Netanyahu swiftly rejected calls for any kind of humanitarian pause, invoking the more [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=56.64s)]
*  than 200 hostages believed to currently be in Hamas's custody in Gaza. That despite the fact [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=62.480000000000004s)]
*  that last week, Israeli's military pointedly did not seem to consider those hostages a strategic [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=67.52s)]
*  priority before their incursion into Gaza. The other thing that happened was the Israeli military [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=73.28s)]
*  took credit for bombing an ambulance outside Gaza's largest hospital. That's the Al-Shifa [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=78.24000000000001s)]
*  hospital that we've been reporting on throughout the conflict. The Gaza Health Ministry says [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=83.2s)]
*  multiple people were killed and dozens more injured. The Israeli military claims the ambulance was [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=87.92s)]
*  shielding Hamas militants, as it often does when justifying why it believes civilian infrastructure [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=93.04s)]
*  is a legitimate military target. The Health Ministry, which is under the authority of Hamas, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=98.56s)]
*  denies those allegations. According to the Washington Post, quote, the dead and wounded [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=104.08s)]
*  visible in the videos reviewed by the paper included women and children and no weapons or [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=108.56s)]
*  individuals wearing military clothing could be seen. For now, it does not seem that the Israeli [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=113.60000000000001s)]
*  military or government is particularly open to the White House's argument for a pause to protect [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=120.08s)]
*  civilians. And while the Biden administration has fallen short of calling for a full ceasefire, [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=126.16s)]
*  as some Democratic members of Congress have called for, the call for a pause nonetheless [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=130.64000000000001s)]
*  represents a shift, a marked one actually, in tone for the White House. President Joe Biden has [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=136.08s)]
*  always been a stalwart supporter of Israel, dating all the way back to his time on the Senate Foreign [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=142.8s)]
*  Relations Committee. I think it's about time we stop those of us who support, as most of us do, [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=148.0s)]
*  Israel in this body for apologizing for our support for Israel. There's no apology to be made, [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=155.44s)]
*  none. It is the best $3 billion investment we make. Whether or not in Israel, the United States of [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=162.64s)]
*  America would have to invent an Israel to protect her interest in the region. The United States would [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=170.39999999999998s)]
*  have to go out and invent an Israel. Well, Senator Biden back in 1986, following the barbaric attacks [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=177.11999999999998s)]
*  on October 7th, the president's initial instinct was to stand firmly with Israel, both, I believe, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=184.64s)]
*  out of genuine moral principle. It's what he believes, as well as U.S. strategic alliances. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=190.96s)]
*  And the approach that I think President Biden adopted with Benjamin Netanyahu, who he has [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=197.28s)]
*  known for decades and talks about that all the time, is that he would publicly pledge his full [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=201.60000000000002s)]
*  support and solidarity to the people in Israel. And then behind the scenes, whenever possible, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=206.16s)]
*  he would try to affect the trajectory of Israel's response while maintaining that public posture of [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=211.36s)]
*  unwavering support. That was clearly the plan. Now, it is true, as numerous national security [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=217.04s)]
*  officials in the U.S. government had said to me, that there is not a single nation on Earth that [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=222.56s)]
*  would have experienced the atrocity Israel went through last month and not responded with some [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=227.04s)]
*  kind of military action. Israel was always going to do something. And that's particularly true when [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=231.76s)]
*  you consider the ancient foundational trauma of a pogrom, of elicited by the mass slaughter of [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=237.68s)]
*  Jewish men, women and children in a state created to stop such an atrocity. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=245.84s)]
*  But there is the abstract principle of Israel's right to self-defense amid mass atrocity, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=253.20000000000002s)]
*  its right to go after the perpetrators of these attacks, which I believe everyone in the U.S. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=257.76s)]
*  government around the world immediately afterwards, many agreed with. And then there's [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=261.68s)]
*  the actual government of the state of Israel, the actual government, the men and women that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=267.28000000000003s)]
*  will empower the actual politics and mechanisms of that state response. Right now, it's a unity [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=271.76s)]
*  government run by Benjamin Netanyahu, which prior to the attacks last month was a hard right [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=278.15999999999997s)]
*  government run by Benjamin Netanyahu, considered by many Israelis to be one of the worst, if not [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=283.28s)]
*  the worst government in the country's history. A Netanyahu government that, first of all, at the [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=289.76s)]
*  most basic level, had the worst security state failing of any government in the world since [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=294.64s)]
*  maybe 9-11 and maybe further back. A government whose primary military objective prior to these [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=301.04s)]
*  attacks appeared to be pursuing its own ideological goals of settler expansion in the West Bank, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=307.36s)]
*  rather than focusing on national security. It's also a government whose explicit strategy for [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=312.88s)]
*  stopping a Palestinian state was to make sure there was divided regimes between Gaza and the [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=318.96000000000004s)]
*  West Bank, which meant supporting Hamas. Benjamin Netanyahu said that famously at a party meeting [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=323.6s)]
*  of his own Likud party in 2019, according to various reports of people who were there. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=330.24s)]
*  Not to mention the fact that Netanyahu himself is also currently under indictment on corruption [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=335.36s)]
*  charges in Israel, charges he denies, and much like Donald Trump, his current attempts to seize [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=339.84000000000003s)]
*  and retain power seem inextricably linked to his own self-preservation. That includes his recent [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=345.2s)]
*  effort to basically take over the Israeli courts and remove the lone single independent check [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=351.04s)]
*  on the executive authority in the state of Israel. That power grab led to widespread protests across [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=356.8s)]
*  the country for months, the largest in Israel's history, with Netanyahu quickly becoming something [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=362.96000000000004s)]
*  of a pariah among many of his own constituents. Not only this particular law that is being, [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=367.68s)]
*  that might pass now, but the line of legislation is going to turn Israel into a, in the best case, [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=375.04s)]
*  a hollow democracy, in the worst case, a dictatorship. And none of us, [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=383.2s)]
*  Air Force pilots, want to serve in an Air Force of a dictatorship. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=388.88s)]
*  Those concerns of eroding democratic norms were exacerbated by the fact that Netanyahu's [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=395.68s)]
*  current coalition may well be the most right-wing government in the country's history, [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=399.76s)]
*  which has collaborated with some of the most fringe, vile figures in all of Israeli politics, [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=404.24s)]
*  in some cases, even in the highest positions of power. Take, for example, Israel's current [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=409.2s)]
*  minister of internal security, that man, a man by the name of Ibn Gavir. This is a man that even [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=414.8s)]
*  the Israeli military refused to draft as a teenager over concerns about his extreme far-right views, [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=420.71999999999997s)]
*  according to the Times of Israel. Ben Gavir openly admires a terrorist, a guy named Baruch Goldstein, [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=426.8s)]
*  who perpetrated one of the bloodiest acts of anti-Palestinian terror back in 1994. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=433.36s)]
*  It's the bloodiest act of violence ever to occur in the occupied territories. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=439.36s)]
*  A Jewish settler opened fire indiscriminately this morning on Muslim worshipers in a crowded [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=445.2s)]
*  mosque during morning prayers. The settler, identified as an American immigrant, slipped [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=450.08000000000004s)]
*  past armed guards at the tomb of the patriarch in Hebron, a holy site for Jews and Arabs. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=454.48s)]
*  Baruch Goldstein, a Jewish American who went to Israel, murdered worshipers in that mosque. Ben [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=461.36s)]
*  Gavir and his wife reportedly had their first date at the site of that mass murderer's grave. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=468.96s)]
*  And for years, Ben Gavir had a big, laudatory, admiring poster of him, the one you see there, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=474.96s)]
*  in his living room. That picture was considered so offensive, so beyond the pale, that even other [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=480.4s)]
*  far-right politicians in Israel wouldn't stand for it. He was effectively barred from joining [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=489.35999999999996s)]
*  the current government, literally unless he took the picture down. And under enormous pressure, [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=494.0s)]
*  Ben Gavir agreed to take the picture down in a self-pitying social media post. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=498.72s)]
*  That guy, Ben Gavir, he's still in power. In fact, he is ordering at least 10,000 guns to arm Israeli [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=504.0s)]
*  settlers in the West Bank, settlers who have only stepped up markedly their campaign of violence, [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=511.28000000000003s)]
*  intimidation, and terror against Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, who have nothing to do [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=516.8000000000001s)]
*  with Hamas, since the October 7th attacks, as reported by Sky News in this package. [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=521.0400000000001s)]
*  They've lived here for generations, but they've decided enough is enough, and the entire population [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=529.36s)]
*  of the West Bank village of Zanota is moving. They have no choice. Israeli settlers have harassed [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=533.76s)]
*  them and threatened them. Now they are being told by the Israeli defense forces that they have a week [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=539.0400000000001s)]
*  to leave. A whole village of Palestinians forcibly ejected from their homes by Israeli settlers. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=544.88s)]
*  This is what's happening right now in the West Bank as this war happens, and one of Israel's own [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=552.48s)]
*  intelligence services, along with less extreme members of its right-wing government and many [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=556.24s)]
*  Israelis, are very concerned about exacerbating tensions in the West Bank, about opening another [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=560.24s)]
*  front when Israel is in this incredibly perilous situation. But this is a coalition government [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=566.32s)]
*  where some of the far-right members believe fundamentally all of Israel is theirs, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=572.4s)]
*  that the enduring state they look for openly, they say this, is one in which Jews control all of [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=576.5600000000001s)]
*  greater Israel, including the West Bank, and they just keep Palestinians occupied and sedate. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=582.0s)]
*  It's not the abstract principle of the right to self-defense or reacting to atrocity. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=588.08s)]
*  There are real people in a government making real decisions. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=592.88s)]
*  So when Secretary of State Antony Blinken shows up and calls for restraint, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=597.52s)]
*  what does he think Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu or his minister with the mass shooter [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=601.44s)]
*  poster are going to say? In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, Israel's defense [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=605.28s)]
*  minister justified the total and immediate blockade of Gaza of all fuel and water and [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=610.8s)]
*  everything, which has led to the unprecedented humanitarian crisis by saying, quote, [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=615.52s)]
*  we are fighting monsters and we are acting accordingly. Human animals is a translation, [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=619.12s)]
*  but some say monsters is closer in the original Hebrew. At least one member of Israeli parliament [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=624.56s)]
*  has called for a Nakba, or the catastrophic mass displacement of Palestinians from Gaza, [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=630.88s)]
*  of which the world has never seen before. This is a Knesset member. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=635.52s)]
*  The New York Times reports that in private conversations, Israeli military leaders told [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=639.76s)]
*  U.S. officials that civilian deaths are just fair game. They compared their strategy to the [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=643.36s)]
*  Allied bombings of Germany and Japan, the two atomic warheads in World War II, the ones that [[00:10:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=648.32s)]
*  killed hundreds of thousands of people. Whatever the Israeli military says publicly about minimizing [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rnd4DVaIvvU&t=655.28s)]
