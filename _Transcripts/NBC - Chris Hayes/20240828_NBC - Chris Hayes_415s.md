# Rep. Jasmine Crockett on JD Vance ‘The guy is a weirdo—it’s really quite simple’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 28, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY)
*  She became a career prosecutor while he became a career criminal, with 34 felonies, two impeachments [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=0.0s)]
*  and one porn star to prove it. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=11.36s)]
*  Kamala Harris has a resume. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=13.44s)]
*  Donald Trump has a rap sheet. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=15.96s)]
*  She presides over the Senate while he keeps our national secrets next to his thinking [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=23.8s)]
*  chair. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=30.0s)]
*  Texas Congresswoman Jasmine Crockett drew a strong contrast between the two people currently [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=33.480000000000004s)]
*  running for president when she addressed the Democratic National Convention last week. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=37.46s)]
*  Freshman House member has been a prominent voice among congressional Democrats not only [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=41.400000000000006s)]
*  for the Democratic presidential ticket, but also the Oversight and Accountability Committee [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=44.56s)]
*  where she has confronted Republicans over their bullying tactics and the ex-presidents [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=48.56s)]
*  for the retention of classified documents. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=52.52s)]
*  Joining me now is congresswoman Jasmine Crockett, Democrat of Texas, who as of today is a new [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=55.080000000000005s)]
*  national co-chair of the Harris Walls campaign. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=59.760000000000005s)]
*  Congratulations on that, congresswoman. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=62.56s)]
*  It's good to see you. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=64.28s)]
*  Good to see you too. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=65.28s)]
*  I want to first start just to get your response to the sound we played of JD Vance in the [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=68.0s)]
*  previous segment where he basically says he's going after Randy Weingarten and he basically [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=73.56s)]
*  says like, if you don't have your own children, like stay the hell away from ours. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=77.64s)]
*  Basically, you shouldn't be a teacher involved in education if you don't have your own children. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=82.2s)]
*  And this is now a whole body of stuff where he really seems to have it out for folks that [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=85.48s)]
*  don't have kids. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=89.4s)]
*  I'm just curious your reaction to that. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=90.4s)]
*  The guy is a weirdo. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=92.8s)]
*  It's really quite simple, you know, and I thought that it was a really good point that was raised [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=95.92s)]
*  about those sisters that teach kids like me because I actually went to Catholic middle [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=99.48s)]
*  school. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=107.03999999999999s)]
*  So I absolutely know what that's like. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=108.03999999999999s)]
*  I am curious to know what he thinks. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=111.2s)]
*  But we also know that they have been pushing the project 2025 agenda and a lot of that [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=114.14s)]
*  agenda kind of has their own definition of what Christianity looks like and what Christian [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=118.9s)]
*  families look like and what we all should be doing. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=124.3s)]
*  And I don't think that that's inclusive of Catholicism and the Muslim folk as well as [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=127.48s)]
*  atheist folk, everybody else, even though we supposedly have this thing called freedom [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=134.82s)]
*  of religion in this country. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=139.8s)]
*  So the Harris Wall campaign, of which you are now a national campaign co-chair, they [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=142.72s)]
*  are they're in Georgia. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=147.92000000000002s)]
*  Georgia looked Georgia looked in rough shape. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=149.24s)]
*  We've got some new swing state polling out today. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=152.16000000000003s)]
*  Again, no one poll is determinative, but it shows narrowing gaps and in fact, a lead in [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=154.20000000000002s)]
*  some of these swing states. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=160.44s)]
*  Harris up in Arizona, up by two points in Georgia, down one in North Carolina, up in [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=162.32000000000002s)]
*  Nevada again, all within the margin of error era. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=166.84s)]
*  They're doing a swing through what's called the black belt in Georgia, in in in areas [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=169.4s)]
*  that are both rural and predominantly African-American. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=175.56s)]
*  I'm just curious your thoughts about that, which I haven't seen a candidate do in a while, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=178.36s)]
*  I got to say. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=182.4s)]
*  I'm very excited about it. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=184.08s)]
*  That is exactly what we're going to get out of this team. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=185.96s)]
*  We're going to get them doing the things that are out of the box because they understand [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  what the stakes look like. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=193.24s)]
*  But here's the reality. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=194.8s)]
*  We are just not having the conversations with rural America that we should be having because [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=195.92s)]
*  we do have an agenda that is actually about bettering their lives. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=199.92s)]
*  When we look at the broadband access that's been brought to rural America, that was brought [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=203.51999999999998s)]
*  by Democrats in the House and the Senate and a Democratic administration. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=207.88s)]
*  That means better access to health care. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=212.64s)]
*  That means better access to jobs. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=214.84s)]
*  That means better access to education. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=216.96s)]
*  A lot of times as someone who lived in East Texas, I know that we are limited to whichever [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=219.96s)]
*  plant is set up in that community. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=225.52s)]
*  And if that plant closes, then that potentially decimates all of your economic opportunities. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=227.44s)]
*  The general feeling in the race right now is a kind of consolidation, the Democratic [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=235.20000000000002s)]
*  base, a campaign that's been been obviously transformed by the departure of the president [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=239.16000000000003s)]
*  and the vice president accepting the nomination. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=244.64000000000001s)]
*  What what keeps you up at night? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=247.8s)]
*  Where like where is your head as you're looking at the next 68, 69 days? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=249.44s)]
*  Yeah, I think the only regret will be that I didn't give it my all. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=256.0s)]
*  Everyone that I talk to, I tell them we've got to run through the tape. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=259.84000000000003s)]
*  We can't take anything for granted. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=263.04s)]
*  We can't look at these polls and get excited. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=264.84000000000003s)]
*  We can't look at how many people are showing up to the rallies and get excited because [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=266.72s)]
*  ultimately the only poll that matters is the poll on Election Day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=270.6s)]
*  And so I don't want people to get comfortable. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=274.36s)]
*  I don't want them to feel as if we have this in the bag because it's far from over. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=276.56s)]
*  And we know that the forces that are working against us are strong and in full force. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=281.59999999999997s)]
*  We know in states like Texas, they're trying to kick people off of the rolls. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=285.76s)]
*  In fact, they are kicking people off the rolls. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=289.44s)]
*  They're now going in and they are perpetrating raids on elderly women that are simply [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=291.59999999999997s)]
*  just trying to do their part for democracy. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=297.44s)]
*  We are facing some really ugly and negative forces. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=300.28s)]
*  They're doing everything that they can to hold on to power. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=303.76s)]
*  And so for me, if I laid back and as Tim Wall says, goes to sleep, he says we can sleep [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=306.92s)]
*  when we dead. I tell people I'm the walking dead right now because I'm not getting sleep. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=312.88s)]
*  But it's just that important. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=318.0s)]
*  We report on the beginning of the show about the altercation that happened in Arlington [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=321.32s)]
*  National Cemetery, where the ex-president brought a campaign videographer, turned his [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=325.64s)]
*  appearance there into a campaign spot that was uploaded on their social media feeds of [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=331.32s)]
*  a worker there. Apparently, again, this is the best we can sort of get from the reporting [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=336.32s)]
*  from NPR and our own reporting and what we've heard, tried to stop them. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=340.56s)]
*  They plowed through that. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=345.2s)]
*  They're kind of doubling down on it. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=347.24s)]
*  And they're saying that the worker at Arlington National Cemetery was having a mental [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=348.76s)]
*  like a mental health issue and sort of attacking that person. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=354.04s)]
*  I'm curious your reaction. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=357.12s)]
*  I mean, it's the same old games with these guys, you know, like they don't abide by [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=359.48s)]
*  norms, they don't abide by the law. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=363.76s)]
*  And honestly, anyone that tries to enforce any rules upon them, they literally just [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=366.08s)]
*  steamroll them and they act as if they were all right. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=371.4s)]
*  It's really unfortunate, especially when you have someone that is running to be the most [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=375.24s)]
*  powerful person in the world to know that they literally just have no appreciation [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=379.2s)]
*  for basic norms. This is not the party of law and order. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=385.24s)]
*  I think that we know that that may have been who the Republicans used to be. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=388.64s)]
*  But MAGA definitely is not that. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qMOYxue9NAY&t=392.36s)]
