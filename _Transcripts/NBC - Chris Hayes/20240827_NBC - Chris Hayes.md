# Trump voter convinced NOT to back Trump after 'unstable' rally speech
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 27, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg)
*  Donald Trump has never had a reputation for honesty or for command of policy issues or for coherence or for reading cleanly from a teleprompter. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=0.0s)]
*  In the past month, in numerous interviews and appearances since Kamala Harris became his election opponent, Trump has gotten worse. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=12.0s)]
*  Hard to imagine that was possible, but that's the case. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=20.0s)]
*  For example, you heard him slur and ramble through a friendly online chat with Twitter owner Elon Musk. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=24.0s)]
*  Kamala wouldn't have this conversation. She can't because she's not smart. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=32.0s)]
*  You know, she's not a smart person, by the way. She can't have this conversation. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=36.0s)]
*  And Biden, we don't even have to talk about it. I mean, he couldn't have this conversation. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=40.0s)]
*  He would have given up on the first half of a question. He would have walked out. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=44.0s)]
*  You heard him call into Fox News after Harris's acceptance speech at the DNC, where he struggled with the network's time constraints and banging the buttons on his own phone. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=49.0s)]
*  Seventy percent of our people are living in poverty. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=61.0s)]
*  She's going to give a tax increase of four to five times what people and companies are paying right now. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=64.0s)]
*  You know what? In the end, the Democrats did the same thing to Joe Biden. They threw Joe Biden out of the party. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=72.0s)]
*  And that's why we saw a different night tonight. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=79.0s)]
*  Mr. President, thank you so much for the time. We appreciate that live feedback. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=81.0s)]
*  Stay right there. Live edition of Gut Felt is coming up. Thank you so much for joining us from Chicago. It's been a great week. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=86.0s)]
*  Good night. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=91.0s)]
*  And despite constant appeals from his aides to avoid personal attacks and stick to the script in his policy speeches. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=92.0s)]
*  Well, you know, we're going to do a free poll. Here's the two questions. Should I get personal? Should I not get personal? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=106.0s)]
*  Should I get personal? Should I not get personal? I don't know. My advisors are fired. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=116.0s)]
*  But I say that I am much better looking than her. I think I'm much better. I'm a better looking person than Kamala. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=129.0s)]
*  And she mentioned thank you about 50 times. Did you see the beginning? Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=139.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=148.0s)]
*  I say, what the hell is wrong with her? This woman is nuts. Look, people say be nice. Have you heard her laugh? [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=152.0s)]
*  That is the laugh of a crazy person. They'll say he was rambling. I don't ramble. I'm a really smart guy. Really smart. I don't ramble. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=160.0s)]
*  You know, I always look for good words. Highly sophisticated. I'm highly educated. I like sophisticated words. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=168.0s)]
*  Some of that came from a heavily publicized campaign rally in Wilkes-Barre, Pennsylvania last week where Trump was supposed to fire up volunteers in a critical battleground state. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=175.0s)]
*  But many supporters left during his rambling 100-minute speech. One of the attendees telling reporters she was done with Trump. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=188.0s)]
*  Quote, I've been thinking of voting for him again because Biden's been so bad for the economy and Kamala won't be any better. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=198.0s)]
*  But after listening to that, I'm actually afraid of Trump being president again. I don't know what he was talking about half the time. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=205.0s)]
*  Perhaps he was always like that, but he seems worse, more unstable. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=212.0s)]
*  On Monday, in an appearance at Arlington National Cemetery, Trump inexplicably and disrespectfully gave photographers a thumbs up over the graves of fallen Marines. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=218.0s)]
*  On social media, Trump reacted to Harris's speech last week by dropping nearly 60 angry posts in just a few hours. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=229.0s)]
*  And just yesterday, Trump deleted another post that he apparently dashed off too fast. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=237.0s)]
*  A post that read, these are great patriots who work their hearts out and have a strong and powerful, spelled very incorrectly there, border, only to be harassed by border czar Kamala Harris, who wants the, and that was it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=242.0s)]
*  I mean, look, he's always been diluted in coherent, mean-spirited, dishonest and impulsive. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=256.0s)]
*  That's just who Trump is. But as he ages and struggles to find his footing in a transformed race, Trump's getting even, shall I say, trumpier. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=263.0s)]
*  The emperor has never had any clothes and it's showing. But is it enough to sink him? We'll ask a couple of campaign experts. That's coming up next. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=274.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9sX45g0Kwg&t=286.0s)]
