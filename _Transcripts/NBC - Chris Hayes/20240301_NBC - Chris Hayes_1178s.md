# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Feb. 29
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Donald Trump is facing many, many trials in this election year, or at least cases that could potentially go to trial. We're going to see if he faces trials. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=0.0s)]
*  We have news on one of them tonight. In the Mar-a-Lago classified documents case, special counsel Jack Smith is, as of just a few hours ago, proposing to the federal court in Florida that that trial should start on July 8th. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=9.0s)]
*  Trump's attorneys are suggesting a trial should start in 2025 after the election, if at all, according to court filings. The judge appointed by Trump in the lame duck session in 2020 may make a decision on that tomorrow. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=23.0s)]
*  We will watch carefully for that. But whatever she decides, that trial date will then have to go through a legal gauntlet, possibly going up to, you guessed it, the Supreme Court based on, you guessed it again, another immunity assertion that Trump is now making in that case, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=37.0s)]
*  even though the crime he committed was not when he was president. Now, how quickly will that move? Well, you see, here's the thing. What the Supreme Court has going for it as an institution by constitutional design is that it is insulated from electoral politics. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=52.0s)]
*  Intentionally, I mean, we give the justices lifetime tenure in large part to ensure their interpretations of the law are not subject to the whims and the passions of pundits and politicians and parties and even majorities of voters. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=68.0s)]
*  But that independence is a two-sided coin. On the flip side comes a danger deep within the court's design that its independence tips over into a kind of reckless lack of accountability. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=81.0s)]
*  And one way in which the Supreme Court of the United States is just completely unaccountable is on the basic question of what it does and when it does it. With a few exceptions, like disputes between two different states over water rights and stuff like that, the court only takes the cases they want to take. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=94.0s)]
*  They reject the ones they don't want. The court can adhere to normal procedure when they want to, and then they could completely break normal procedure whenever they want to. When they want to act fast, they can act very, very fast. When they want to slow walk something, they can go very slow. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=112.0s)]
*  Yesterday's one page announcement that after two and a half weeks of doing Lord knows what, they were scheduling arguments on Donald Trump's claim of presidential immunity from prosecution for seven weeks from now seems to indicate that a conservative majority of the court does not want to move particularly quickly. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=128.0s)]
*  And I would hazard that part of that reason is that to move quickly would mean Donald Trump would face an imminent trial for the insurrection he fomented, and that would, I think, appreciably hurt his chances of being the next president. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=146.0s)]
*  But if the Supreme Court justices wanted to move quickly, they definitely could. Let me give you a little recent context for this because I think it's important and it can get lost in the procedural weeds. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=158.0s)]
*  So back in December, Donald Trump filed a claim saying he was immune from prosecution for trying to overturn the election because he was being charged for acts he committed while he was president. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=168.0s)]
*  And the district judge in that case, Tonya Chutkin, heard arguments and issued a very well-reasoned ruling saying, no, buddy, it doesn't work that way. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=180.0s)]
*  Quote, whatever immunity a sitting president may enjoy, the United States has only one chief executive at a time, and that position does not confer a lifelong get-out-of-jail-free pass. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=188.0s)]
*  And then the special counsel prosecuting the case, Jack Smith, did something a little novel and even audacious. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=199.0s)]
*  Rather than waiting for Donald Trump to appeal that ruling to the D.C. Circuit, which is the next step up the ladder, Smith said, hey, we all know this is going to end up in the Supreme Court. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=206.0s)]
*  Let's just go to the Supreme Court now. Let's do it. Let's have it out. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=216.0s)]
*  And he applied for this somewhat rare procedural mechanism that's called cert before judgment. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=219.0s)]
*  And what it means is that you basically leapfrog a step. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=225.0s)]
*  You leapfrog the appellate court and you rush straight to the doors of the Supreme Court to save time in this case. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=228.0s)]
*  And also because you know it's going to end up there. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=235.0s)]
*  And when he tried to do that, the Supreme Court responded, no, no, no, clear jets. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=237.0s)]
*  We're going to let the appeals run their course first. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=243.0s)]
*  So now, of course, another two months have gone by. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=246.0s)]
*  The appellate court has ruled unanimously against Trump. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=248.0s)]
*  They issued their own very strong, unanimous opinion and then petitioned back up the Supreme Court. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=251.0s)]
*  And what does the Supreme Court do in response? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=256.0s)]
*  They say, you know what? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=257.0s)]
*  Actually, check that we do want to hear the case seven weeks from now. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=259.0s)]
*  So the court succeeded in burning more than three months off the calendar. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=266.0s)]
*  And it's I want to be clear here. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=271.0s)]
*  It's not just that they could have gone faster. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=272.0s)]
*  It is that on other recent cases, they have shown themselves extremely ready to jump in and snatch issues from the lower courts when it suits them. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=274.0s)]
*  For instance, when President Joe Biden issued an executive order that would have canceled literally hundreds of billions of dollars in student debt for millions of our fellow Americans, a bunch of Republican states sued to stop the plan. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=282.0s)]
*  They lost their lawsuit at the district level and they appealed. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=297.0s)]
*  And then you know what happened? [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=300.0s)]
*  The Supreme Court stepped in and they granted cert before judgment. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=301.0s)]
*  Same thing. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=306.0s)]
*  Jack Smith wanted to leapfrog the appellate court and take up the case on an expedited basis. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=307.0s)]
*  Now, was there something particularly pressing about this case? [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=311.0s)]
*  Other than the notion that millions of American students would have their debt canceled? [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=315.0s)]
*  Not really. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=319.0s)]
*  I mean, it wasn't like a death row appeal, but sure enough, look at that. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=320.0s)]
*  The court just could not wait. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=324.0s)]
*  They couldn't move fast enough. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=326.0s)]
*  They came together with a conservative majority on incredibly novel legal reasoning and they snatched back that debt cancellation to make sure that students would have to pay every cent of their student loans. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=327.0s)]
*  They could not move fast enough to make sure no one got their debt canceled. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=338.0s)]
*  They were in a real hurry on that one. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=343.0s)]
*  Same process played out in August 2021. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=345.0s)]
*  President Biden wanted to extend the Trump administration's pandemic moratorium on evictions. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=348.0s)]
*  So in the midst of a once in a century pandemic, you don't boot people with their stuff out onto the street. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=354.0s)]
*  Landlords and realtors challenged it. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=361.0s)]
*  And while it was before an appellate court, they petitioned the Supreme Court for immediate relief. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=364.0s)]
*  They said, we don't want to wait. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=369.0s)]
*  We want to jump the line. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=370.0s)]
*  We want to go to the straight Supreme Court. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=371.0s)]
*  Just over three weeks after Biden ordered the eviction ban, the six conservative justices of the Supreme Court sprang into action. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=373.0s)]
*  Quickly deciding the moratorium could not stand that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=382.0s)]
*  Yes, you can throw people out of their homes. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=385.0s)]
*  Three weeks. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=389.0s)]
*  They had to do whatever it took. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=392.0s)]
*  Burn the midnight oil, feed the clerks extra helpings of Red Bull to make sure people could start being evicted again. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=394.0s)]
*  Those are just two obvious examples on this court in recent memory. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=403.0s)]
*  But it's also clearly the case for American history. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=408.0s)]
*  The court can and does move very quickly on high profile cases with national political significance. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=411.0s)]
*  We talked about this case a lot yesterday. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=417.0s)]
*  You know what? [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=418.0s)]
*  You love it. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=419.0s)]
*  U.S. v. Nixon, the infamous case in which Richard Nixon refused to hand tape recordings from the Oval Office over to a federal judge in the Watergate scandal. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=420.0s)]
*  Everyone in the country understood this was make or break for Nixon. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=429.0s)]
*  It was the biggest case of the time. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=433.0s)]
*  Those tapes could prove his involvement in crimes. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=436.0s)]
*  And on July 8th, 1974, the Supreme Court heard arguments in the case when they weren't even in a regular session. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=439.0s)]
*  A decision is expected in a week or two. [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=447.0s)]
*  Even before this morning's argument, one justice was writing and circulating his ideas. [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=450.0s)]
*  Another had his clerk prepare a draft opinion. [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=455.0s)]
*  With the fate of the republic on the line, the court issued their decision just 16 days later. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=458.0s)]
*  President Nixon has not yet responded to the sledgehammer decision of the Supreme Court today, which ruled that he must immediately turn over tapes of 64 presidential conversations. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=465.0s)]
*  What about Bush v. Gore? Remember that one? [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=477.0s)]
*  2000 election recount in Florida. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=479.0s)]
*  Barely a month after the votes were cast and a day, one day after Florida's highest court ordered a statewide recount, the Supreme Court stepped in. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=481.0s)]
*  They granted the Bush campaign an emergency stay to stop Florida from counting the votes. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=489.0s)]
*  Do not count any more votes. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=495.0s)]
*  The reason that Bush wanted that was that the Bush campaign was worried that if the recount continued, Al Gore would pull ahead. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=497.0s)]
*  And then one day after granting served in one of the most expedited cases of all time, the conservative court took oral arguments and began deliberating quickly. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=503.0s)]
*  It doesn't get any more tense than this. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=514.0s)]
*  The justices working for a second night on their historic decision. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=517.0s)]
*  All this waiting for a decision in a case that was, after all, argued only yesterday. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=520.0s)]
*  The justices seem determined to rule on this case quickly, well aware of the coming deadlines for choosing presidential electors. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=525.0s)]
*  Just four days after granting their initial stay by a single vote, the high court permanently stopped the recount and gifted to George W. Bush a presidential victory. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=531.0s)]
*  So when it comes to making sure that a presidential Republican candidate for president gets into office, man, the Supreme Court can really move at the speed of light, can't they? [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=541.0s)]
*  The point here is that even though this conservative court seemingly tipped their hand this month by sitting on the Trump case for two weeks and then scheduling it for arguments way down the line on April 22nd, they can still, if they want to, move very quickly. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=550.0s)]
*  It is still in their power. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=565.0s)]
*  And no one should let them off the hook on this massively important and weighty question before the nation. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=567.0s)]
*  Will the man who tried to overthrow the Constitutional Republic face a trial for those alleged crimes or will he not? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=573.0s)]
*  Nine Americans can still decide that Donald Trump deserves to stand trial, to present evidence under our Constitution before a jury of his peers to find out whether he is guilty or he is innocent of what he is charged before hundreds of millions of Americans go into a court of law. [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=581.0s)]
*  Let's go to the voting booth and see Trump's name on their ballot. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=597.0s)]
*  If you have tuned into right wing media at all over the past few months, you might have noticed that after spending years beating the drum on inflation, Fox News does not really want to talk about the economy anymore. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=600.0s)]
*  They sure as heck do not want to talk about abortion. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=610.0s)]
*  So what is their new pet issue heading into the general election? [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=612.0s)]
*  So-called migrant crime. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=615.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=618.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=619.0s)]
*  Honestly, you cannot overstate the deluge of coverage. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=620.0s)]
*  At any given moment all day, Fox is either reporting on crime, finishing a segment of crime, or about to run a segment on migrant crime. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=623.0s)]
*  Migrant crime is beginning to spiral out of control. [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=633.0s)]
*  There's a migrant crime spree killing Americans. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=636.0s)]
*  Migrant crime wave. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=639.0s)]
*  The migrant crime crisis. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=640.0s)]
*  Migrant crime. [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=641.0s)]
*  The growing immigrant crime crisis. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=642.0s)]
*  Every third day there's a story about some sort of migrant crime. [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=645.0s)]
*  The drumbeat of propaganda has been moving not just Republicans, but public opinion overall in a really bad direction. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=649.0s)]
*  A recent Pew poll found that a clear majority of Americans believe a large increase in the migrant population leads to an increase in crime. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=655.0s)]
*  The problem is it's not true. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=662.0s)]
*  It is simply not true. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=664.0s)]
*  It is a right wing invention. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=665.0s)]
*  According to preliminary data from last year published by the New York Times, quote, the country is likely to see one of the largest, if not the largest, yearly declines in homicides. [[00:11:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=668.0s)]
*  That's right. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=678.0s)]
*  We are going to set a record in 2023 for a drop in homicides. [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=679.0s)]
*  So to recap, homicides saw a near record single year spike under Donald Trump. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=683.0s)]
*  And it now appears the largest single year decline in homicides ever in American history happened under Joe Biden. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=689.0s)]
*  And I will further speculate that if 2023 saw the biggest one year increase increase in the homicide rate and record American history, everyone would know about it. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=697.0s)]
*  But what's more, according to a new analysis from NBC News, quote, expert analysis and available data from major city police departments show despite several horrifying high profile incidents, there is no evidence of a migrant driven crime wave in the United States. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=707.0s)]
*  In fact, in many of the cities like New York that have taken in a huge amount of migrants and really have been a lot, crime has gone down quite considerably. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=722.0s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=731.0s)]
*  It's not just, of course, the data that matters because this manufactured crisis is at the heart of Donald Trump's monstrous vision for a second term. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=732.0s)]
*  As president, I will carry out the largest domestic deportation operation in American history to remove Joe Biden's illegals and murderers, because that's what many of them are. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=740.0s)]
*  It's very simple. If they don't go back to their countries, we will never get back our country. [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=751.0s)]
*  It's predicated on lies, but they're effective lies. [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=757.0s)]
*  And we need to combat Trump's promises with an alternate vision for our future. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=761.0s)]
*  Donald Trump and Republicans are not interested in that. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=766.0s)]
*  They're not interested in solutions at all. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=769.0s)]
*  As President Biden noted today during his visit to the border, they won't even consider the very conservative border bill that was struck as a deal between Republicans and Democrats before Donald Trump killed it. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=771.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is wrong about migrants. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=783.0s)]
*  He's proposing what amounts to a system, get this, of national martial law that would deport eight million people with the National Guards of right wing states being brought in to do it. [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=785.0s)]
*  Americans don't actually want that. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=795.0s)]
*  The only way to make the case is to start trying to combat his false framing instead of trying to operate within it. [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=797.0s)]
*  Nancy Pelosi had not yet begun her career in politics when the Supreme Court enshrined the constitutional right to an abortion Roe v. Wade. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=805.0s)]
*  Nearly 50 years later, she was the first female Speaker of the House when the court overturned Roe, throwing out a half century of progress. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=811.0s)]
*  Under her leadership, the House immediately passed legislation to restore abortion rights nationwide. [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=818.0s)]
*  Those efforts went nowhere in the Republican-led Senate. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=823.0s)]
*  Now, as Speaker of America, Nancy Pelosi continues to fight against Republican project to eliminate reproductive rights in America. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=826.0s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=832.0s)]
*  It's great to have you, Congresswoman. [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=834.0s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. Lovely to be with you as we talk about matters that relate to America's families. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=836.0s)]
*  Yeah, I want to I want to ask just about this bill because you it was so wild to me to watch them all rush out with these statements, which I understood because obviously the political crisis. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=842.0s)]
*  I think probably 90 percent of Americans found the Alabama ruling awful. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=853.0s)]
*  And then to just Google the fact that they've got a majority are co-sponsors on this bill that just plainly does what Alabama does with the Alabama ruling does. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=856.0s)]
*  Do you think they know that they're on that bill? [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=866.0s)]
*  Do you like are they pretending to not know what's going on? [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=870.0s)]
*  Well, let's see what the title is. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=874.0s)]
*  Life at Conception Act. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=876.0s)]
*  So they have to know what that means. [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=879.0s)]
*  I've said for years that I think the people on the other side of the aisle need a lesson in the birds and the bees, because sometimes they don't seem to understand. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=881.0s)]
*  But the fact is that one hundred and twenty five majority of the House GOP has our co-sponsors of this legislation. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=890.0s)]
*  That doesn't mean there aren't more who would be supporting it. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=899.0s)]
*  But it comes at an interesting time. [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=902.0s)]
*  And instead, we have in the House a place for them all to go if they disagree with the Alabama decision. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=905.0s)]
*  Congresswoman Susan Wild of Pennsylvania has early on introduced a bill with Senator Duckworth in the Senate, a corresponding bill called the Access to Family Building Act. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=912.0s)]
*  And this would enable families to have a statutory right to have access to the technology and the rest for in vitro fertilization. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=925.0s)]
*  It would also empower the Justice Department to act upon those who would deprive women of those rights and give women a right of private action. [[00:15:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=935.0s)]
*  If someone tried to deprive them of that, it does more. [[00:15:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=945.0s)]
*  But that's the essence of the bill. [[00:15:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=948.0s)]
*  They could easily sign on to this bill to contain their enthusiasm for in vitro fertilization. [[00:15:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=950.0s)]
*  Instead, they have life at contraception, which is a contradiction. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=957.0s)]
*  Well, what's striking here, too, is that I actually think, you know, when you look at Alabama, right, they move very quickly because they understood the political. [[00:16:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=961.0s)]
*  They understood the politics of it, that it was completely upside down. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=967.0s)]
*  It strikes me as honestly just as a pure political play that a Mike Johnson led house teaming up with the Schumer led Senate to pass legislation that federally protected IVF would probably be a political benefit to Republicans. [[00:16:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=971.0s)]
*  But my sense is that there's enough of the caucus that actually doesn't think it's OK that they're not going to move to a vote on that. [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=983.0s)]
*  Well, let's hope that that's not the case. [[00:16:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=991.0s)]
*  As you've heard me say again and again, President Lincoln said public sentiment is everything. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=994.0s)]
*  There's nothing more eloquent to a member of Congress in the voice of his or her own constituents. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1000.0s)]
*  Lincoln didn't say that. I'm saying that. [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1005.0s)]
*  So we want people to weigh in with their members of Congress. [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1007.0s)]
*  I've heard from people of faith about Catholics, even nuns, saying this is a gift of God to enable families to have babies. [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1011.0s)]
*  And they spend their life saying that that's what they want. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1020.0s)]
*  And now when they have that opportunity, they have the life at contraception at Conception Act. [[00:17:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1025.0s)]
*  Let me ask you. [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1031.0s)]
*  Not contraception, mind you. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1032.0s)]
*  Eight of them in the House, eight Republicans in the House voted for women to have a right to contraception. [[00:17:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1033.0s)]
*  That meant 195 of them voted. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1040.0s)]
*  Eight of them. [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1043.0s)]
*  Women shouldn't have a right to contraception. [[00:17:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1044.0s)]
*  There's a lot going on in Congress this week. [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1047.0s)]
*  Mike Johnson is very clearly, I think everyone would agree in over his head. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1049.0s)]
*  I don't even think that's a controversial assessment. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1053.0s)]
*  Meanwhile, Mitch McConnell has announced that he'll be stepping down a Senate majority leader. [[00:17:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1056.0s)]
*  And I thought of you when I saw that announcement because your careers have been both parallel and at times intertwined. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1059.0s)]
*  And I thought, I wonder what Nancy Pelosi thinks about Mitch McConnell's announcement. [[00:17:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1064.0s)]
*  Well, I've worked with Mitch for years. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1070.0s)]
*  We had a similar position in the 90s as we had a corresponding role as the top Democrat and top Republican House and Senate on the Foreign Operations of Appropriation. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1072.0s)]
*  So I've known and worked with him for a long time. [[00:18:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1082.0s)]
*  I've disagreed with him a lot. [[00:18:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1084.0s)]
*  In fact, he's wrecked us with the court in terms of women's right to choose and so much else that this rogue court is going down a path of. [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1086.0s)]
*  But we've worked on other issues together. [[00:18:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1095.0s)]
*  It's interesting to me, though, if I just may say, I for 20 years was in leadership, either this leader of the House or the Speaker of the House, passed landmark legislation, affordable health care. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1097.0s)]
*  The list goes on and on rescue package infrastructure bill, a compact act for our veterans, IRA to save our planet and to reduce the cost of prescription drugs. [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1110.0s)]
*  Chips bill just to bring some things that are new needs. [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1123.0s)]
*  When I stepped aside, they said she stepped aside, but she's still here. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1127.0s)]
*  When he stepped aside, end of an era. [[00:18:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1131.0s)]
*  It's a guy thing. I know. [[00:18:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1134.0s)]
*  But I have to just say for women, we want our proper attention to so in any event, I wish him well in his decision. [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1136.0s)]
*  I worry about his health. [[00:19:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1145.0s)]
*  I'm sad for his family's loss recently. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1147.0s)]
*  Elaine losing her sister and we'll just see how it goes. [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1149.0s)]
*  But a very strategic player in the Congress. [[00:19:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1153.0s)]
*  You [[00:19:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x4xMY3NxxvA&t=1166.0s)]
