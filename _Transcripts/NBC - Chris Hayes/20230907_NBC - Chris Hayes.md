# ‘Wrong’ and ‘excessive’ DeSantis, Ramaswamy criticize Proud Boys sentences
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 07, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk)
*  As of today, all the Proud Boy leaders charged in the wake of the insurrection have been [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=0.0s)]
*  found guilty by a jury of their peers and sentenced. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=4.08s)]
*  The five men will spend the next decade or two in prison, from Enrique Tarrio's record [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=7.04s)]
*  22 years to Dominic Pizola's 10 years. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=12.52s)]
*  And we're learning that the men were offered plea deals by the Justice Department that [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=16.080000000000002s)]
*  would have drastically reduced their prison time. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=19.72s)]
*  According to a filing by an attorney for the two of the men, the offer would have cut their [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=22.16s)]
*  collective time by more than half. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=26.5s)]
*  They all declined and went to trial and will spend a combined 82 years in prison, adding [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=28.84s)]
*  to the cumulative 700 years and January 6 sentences so far. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=33.56s)]
*  So now, the leadership of the Proud Boys behind bars for 10 to 20 years, I guess is worth [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=38.6s)]
*  asking what comes next for a group, what it means for our imperiled democratic order. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=43.04s)]
*  Andy Campbell is a senior editor and reporter at HuffPost, the author of We Are the Proud [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=48.480000000000004s)]
*  Boys, how a right-wing street gang ushered in a new era of American extremism, and he [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=52.08s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=57.76s)]
*  You know, Andy, I've sort of I've read your reporting on the Proud Boys, covered them [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=58.76s)]
*  enough over the years, and they've always sort of straddled this line between like kind [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=63.48s)]
*  of preposterous cosplay and actual kind of menace. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=66.82s)]
*  And the sort of culmination, I think, of their actions was January 6, where they ended up [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=72.62s)]
*  in that latter category. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=76.06s)]
*  How do you understand the group and how do you understand what they did on January 6 [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=78.4s)]
*  in relation to that that history? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=82.56s)]
*  Right. Well, they project themselves to the public as a drinking club who sort of accidentally [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  fell into self-defense on January 6 and during a bunch of events on the parade of violence, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=93.67999999999999s)]
*  they've been going on seven, eight years now. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=99.08s)]
*  But the Proud Boys, while they are very drunk, while they are doing drugs out there, while [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=102.75999999999999s)]
*  they are partying, their directive and the thing that they work toward is committing [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=106.96000000000001s)]
*  acts of political violence for Republican causes. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=112.4s)]
*  And for their inception, Trump was their director. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=116.04s)]
*  Trump was the one pointing out the grievances that they would fight for. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=121.24000000000001s)]
*  And at the end, it was Trump. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=125.28s)]
*  You know, they we were just told that they were about to take plea deals or that they [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=127.84s)]
*  didn't take plea deals. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=132.88s)]
*  It turns out Enrique Tarrio gave an interview today with the Gateway Pundit, in which he [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=134.16s)]
*  said outrageously that he didn't take a plea deal because the federal government wanted him to lie [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=139.12s)]
*  about Trump. And it just shows how much they believe Trump is their guy despite getting [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=144.20000000000002s)]
*  zero love from the guy throughout their entire existence. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  So you've got the you know, these guys are all going to do serious time. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=154.84s)]
*  The Tarrio got 22 years the head of that organization. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=157.56s)]
*  I didn't realize he's giving an interview to Gateway Pundit, which shows that like none of them [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=160.36s)]
*  seem to actually be remorseful or actually filled with regret. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=163.96s)]
*  That seems like they're committed to this. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=166.67999999999998s)]
*  We should also see there's a long context if you read, you know, 20th century European history of like [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=169.32s)]
*  right wing parties having like street fighting thugs that beat people up and commit political [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=174.04s)]
*  violence on behalf of far right parties. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=178.32s)]
*  What does this mean for them now? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=181.16s)]
*  Well, let's get it straight. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=184.56s)]
*  The Proud Boys didn't go away after January 6th. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=186.27999999999997s)]
*  They're not going away now. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=189.67999999999998s)]
*  I mean, despite their leaders sitting behind bars, the Proud Boys have been fighting the [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=191.0s)]
*  GOP's grievances in the street. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=196.32s)]
*  That grievance lately has been LGBTQ issues, trans health care and drag queen story hours among them. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=198.28s)]
*  So they've been out across the country going more local and attacking and harassing people at drag queen [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=204.84s)]
*  story hours, children's hospitals, public libraries, places where these things are discussed. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=211.35999999999999s)]
*  The only change that happened since these sentences and since January 6th is that they aren't amassing [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=216.68s)]
*  for Donald Trump because it's worrisome. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=223.12s)]
*  They're worried about federal infiltration. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=225.32s)]
*  They're worried about consequences. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=227.32s)]
*  But they were directed by Enrique Tario to go local, to run for office, to sidle up next to politicians in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=229.2s)]
*  their locales and do things that way. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=236.8s)]
*  And they've done that very successfully under the public eye since January 6th. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=239.32s)]
*  So their extremism continues. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=244.8s)]
*  And I argue that if the Proud Boys dissolve tomorrow or change their name, which I don't expect to [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=248.24s)]
*  happen, the political violence that they helped normalize for this era of the GOP is still so ingrained that [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=253.32s)]
*  that is sticking around. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=260.6s)]
*  The extremism is still out there. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=261.84s)]
*  It's still being put into policy. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=263.92s)]
*  So we're not seeing the Proud Boys going away anytime soon. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=266.08s)]
*  Yeah, I think that point about, you know, again, in 20th century European politics, particularly in other [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=268.8s)]
*  places in the world, it has been a not uncommon thing for parties, movements and factions, particularly on the [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=274.52s)]
*  extreme right, to have a street fighting force, a violent force, sometimes that are outright armed and murderous. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=280.84000000000003s)]
*  They have introduced a kind of form of those politics which hadn't really been quite there in American politics in a while. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=287.16s)]
*  Obviously, this is what various groups like the KKK were back in the 1920s. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=293.2s)]
*  They were an armed part, a violent part of a political faction. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=297.48s)]
*  You also, about this, about the sort of local leaders, you're writing that the Proud Boys, they've made inroads [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=301.84000000000003s)]
*  with GOPs since January 6. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=306.24s)]
*  Members have been running for minor elected offices across the country. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=308.52s)]
*  Several have secured seats alongside the GOP elite. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=311.40000000000003s)]
*  A Proud Boy in Sarasota County, Florida, for example, was elected last year to the County Republican Executive Committee, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=314.24s)]
*  where he has the power to influence local politics alongside fellow committee member Mike Flynn, Trump's one-time national security advisor. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=319.56s)]
*  We've got news today that both Ron DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy have said that their sentences are too long and asked about considering pardons and definitely not ruling it out. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=326.40000000000003s)]
*  What do you think that does? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=335.24s)]
*  What's the effect of that kind of language from non-Trump Republican leaders? [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=336.6s)]
*  Well, look, I mean, it shows that the Proud Boys and the violence that they've committed is still fully embraced by the GOP. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=342.24s)]
*  This political violence isn't going away until the GOP calls its neo-fascist foot soldiers out of the street, right, and until they believe in elections. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=349.88s)]
*  The next election is going to be under threat until the Republicans pull that out. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=359.76s)]
*  And so to have DeSantis saying that, the Proud Boys certainly believe them and will throw their support behind them for it. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=364.84000000000003s)]
*  Andy Campbell, who wrote a really good book about this. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=370.88s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jY72beTgNdk&t=373.24s)]
