Video Description: Former Rep. Carlos Curbelo, and Eugene Daniels, co-author of Politico's Playbook, talk about the effort by Ron DeSantis to appeal to Republican voters by presenting himself as more extreme than Donald Trump on issues ranging from immigration to LGBTQ rights and whether doing so will poison him in the eyes of general election voters.

# Extremism of GOP base could make Republican candidate too toxic for general election
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ)
*  Donald Trump's challengers for the Republican presidential nomination are struggling to [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=0.0s)]
*  find their footing. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=4.8s)]
*  This weekend, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis' presidential campaign ended Pride Month by [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=6.32s)]
*  sharing a video that was widely panned as homophobic. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=10.48s)]
*  The video is set to club music with rainbow filters. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=14.06s)]
*  It shows Donald Trump at various points in his presidency expressing support for the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  LGBTQ community, despite his long record of curtailing their rights. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=21.56s)]
*  The video then celebrates DeSantis' own crackdown on LGBTQ rights promoting headlines that call [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=26.16s)]
*  DeSantis' policies draconian. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=32.68s)]
*  The DeSantis campaign stunt was met with quick condemnation from both Democrats and Republicans. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=35.519999999999996s)]
*  The Log Cabin Republicans, a conservative pro-LGBTQ group, called the video divisive [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=41.44s)]
*  and desperate, instead adventuring into homophobic territory. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=47.0s)]
*  The most prominent openly gay member of Trump's administration, Richard Grinnell, called the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=51.08s)]
*  video undeniably homophobic. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=55.36s)]
*  And Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg had this to say in an interview on Sunday. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=58.08s)]
*  And I'm going to leave aside the strangeness of trying to prove your manhood by putting [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=64.72s)]
*  up a video that splices images of you in between oiled up shirtless bodybuilders. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=69.8s)]
*  Who are you trying to help? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=75.42s)]
*  Who are you trying to make better off? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=77.4s)]
*  And what public policy problems do you get up in the morning thinking about how to solve? [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=78.8s)]
*  The video is the latest attempt by a Republican presidential contender to try to win over [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=85.56s)]
*  Trump's base of diehard MAGA extremists. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=90.4s)]
*  But Trump's base has proven time and time again that they are not easily courted. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=93.44s)]
*  Consider Senator Lindsey Graham, who has spent the last six years as a loyal Trump foot soldier. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=98.24000000000001s)]
*  Well, this weekend, Graham appeared alongside Trump at a campaign event in his home state [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=102.84s)]
*  of South Carolina. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=107.32000000000001s)]
*  And this was the welcome he got from that Trump-supporting crowd. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=108.8s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome United States Senator Lindsey Graham. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=113.16s)]
*  Thank y'all. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=121.64s)]
*  Welcome to Pickens. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=128.16s)]
*  Thank y'all for coming. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=133.16s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=136.16s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=138.16s)]
*  Every campaign strategist's nightmare. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=140.16s)]
*  Joining us now are former Republican Congressman Carlos Corbello and Politico White House correspondent [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=142.16s)]
*  and Playbook co-author Eugene Daniels. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=147.84s)]
*  Carlos, let me start with you. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=150.44s)]
*  How much do base Republican voters actually want their candidates to go after the LGBTQ community? [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=153.12s)]
*  Look, Simone, there is a segment of the Republican primary electorate that finds this in some [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=160.16s)]
*  way attractive, can get behind this. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=167.16s)]
*  It is a minority of the Republican electorate, but Ronda Santis is clearly trying to do everything [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=170.04s)]
*  possible to catch up with Donald Trump. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=175.2s)]
*  Now, at the end of the day, this is a fool's error. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=177.48s)]
*  Number one, it's wrong. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=180.0s)]
*  It's very divisive. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=181.0s)]
*  And, you know, Donald Trump, for all of his flaws, I could tell you from personal conversations [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=182.0s)]
*  with him, doesn't have anything against the LGBT community, believes in equality. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=187.76s)]
*  And for Ronda Santis to attack him on this when there are so many issues to attack Donald [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=193.76s)]
*  Trump on is just a shame. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=198.72s)]
*  Now, politically, the problem is that in a general election, swing voters in swing states [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=201.16s)]
*  and swing districts outright reject this kind of rhetoric, this kind of divisiveness, this [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=207.04s)]
*  kind of speech. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=213.2s)]
*  So while Governor Santis might be trying to do himself a favor in this primary, trying [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=214.39999999999998s)]
*  to pick up some votes wherever he can, he's really setting himself up for failure if he [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=219.72s)]
*  actually gets past the primary. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=223.6s)]
*  You know, DeSantis is for way, if you will, wading into these divisive waters that he [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=226.8s)]
*  regularly swims in, if we're just going to be honest. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=233.88s)]
*  It's like red meat for the 35%. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=237.12s)]
*  Then you've got folks like former New Jersey Governor Chris Christie. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=238.88s)]
*  And I think that he recently had one of the better Republican answers when it came to [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=243.4s)]
*  discussing the LGBTQ community. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=247.56s)]
*  He framed decisions about trans health care for children as a parent's decision and not [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=250.16s)]
*  the government's. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=255.36s)]
*  And I frankly think that he demonstrated you can give an answer that doesn't contain red [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=257.44s)]
*  meat. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=263.24s)]
*  Can you survive a Republican primary that way, though, Carlos, in this particular climate? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=264.24s)]
*  These days, it really doesn't seem so, Simone. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=270.12s)]
*  It's an experiment. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=272.6s)]
*  Chris Christie's conducting it. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=273.6s)]
*  He's not getting a whole lot of traction right now. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=275.52s)]
*  But again, for all of his flaws, you hear Donald Trump out there talking about abortion, [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=278.88s)]
*  for example, criticizing Ron DeSantis for the six-week ban in the state of Florida. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=284.71999999999997s)]
*  Even someone like Donald Trump, who has obviously adopted many extreme positions, understands [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=289.56s)]
*  what it takes to win and understands that you can't disqualify yourself entirely in [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=295.84s)]
*  a general election by taking these extremist positions, by saying things that swing voters [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=301.36s)]
*  in a lot of those districts that, since the Republican trifecta of 2016 have gone Democrat, [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=307.4s)]
*  well, that's going to continue as long as Republicans keep following this Ron DeSantis [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=313.56s)]
*  playbook. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=319.52s)]
*  It isn't even the Donald Trump playbook anymore because Trump is rejecting some elements of [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=320.52s)]
*  it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=324.8s)]
*  Donald Trump's playbook is so interesting to me because, on one hand, he's saying that [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=325.8s)]
*  about Ron DeSantis, and on the other, he's saying, I overturned Roe. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=330.84000000000003s)]
*  It just makes no sense. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=334.64s)]
*  That's the Republican primary. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=335.64s)]
*  Eugene, there is not a Democratic primary because Joe Biden has decided to run for reelection, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=337.2s)]
*  so he is the Democrats' nominee. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=342.3s)]
*  Now, the White House, the president is running his campaign, and the White House has said [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=344.32s)]
*  that the president is going to continue to govern while he is doing this election situation. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=350.2s)]
*  I'm wondering about that strategy amidst what is a very tense political climate and in a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=356.92s)]
*  time where turnout is going to be the key when it does come to the general election. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=364.88s)]
*  At the center of their message is that he is the person who put his hands on the wheel, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=368.76s)]
*  and if you didn't like Donald Trump, he kind of eased things down a little bit in the country. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=373.6s)]
*  That is at the center, and his governing, him being president, being at the White House, [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  that's at the center of that. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=382.36s)]
*  So that's part one. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=383.36s)]
*  And so you've seen some of these events that they've done a little bit, but they've been [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=384.36s)]
*  mostly like policy events, right? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=388.36s)]
*  They did the event about Roe v. Wade. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=390.34000000000003s)]
*  They did an event around his economic message with a bunch of unions talking about that. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=393.6s)]
*  That is what it's going to look like, I'm told, and that you're not going to see him [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=399.68s)]
*  out in the streets as much as maybe some folks would want him to. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=403.0s)]
*  They often, we were talking right before we came on, they talk about how Barack Obama [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=406.76s)]
*  ran for reelection in 2012. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=410.64s)]
*  And they say it'll look more like the Obama strategy. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=412.72s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=415.0s)]
*  And these are two very different types of politicians. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=416.0s)]
*  It is a very different time period in American politics. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=418.32s)]
*  And Donald Trump was not running in 2012, right? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=421.84000000000003s)]
*  Ron DeSantis was not running in 2012. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=423.8s)]
*  And so you have Democrats a little nervous. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=426.12s)]
*  They've been wanting to see him out there. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=428.96000000000004s)]
*  They've been wanting him especially to see him more fundraising, more seeing Vice President [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=430.84000000000003s)]
*  Kamala Harris, the principals, Joe Biden and Doug Emhoff out there fundraising more. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=434.56s)]
*  They've been doing more of that. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=439.16s)]
*  I wouldn't expect a lot more to kind of satiate those people who are a little nervous until [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=440.24s)]
*  the end of this year going into the beginning of next. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=444.92s)]
*  So we see, especially Donald Trump, you know, Donald Trump is, whether people want to accept [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  it or not, he is right now the front runner. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=454.36s)]
*  Now, I do think things can change the way you run a presidential primary is delegate [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=456.36s)]
*  by delegate, state by state. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=461.64s)]
*  And Chris Christie is kind of gay in New Hampshire. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=463.32s)]
*  So we'll see what happens there. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=465.48s)]
*  But Donald Trump's strategy has still been these huge rallies. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=467.04s)]
*  We don't see him doing a lot of retail politics. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=470.0s)]
*  So do you think that there's room in this primary for a Republican who may be good at [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=473.52s)]
*  retail politics to edge out Donald Trump? [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=478.36s)]
*  What are other Republicans saying out there? [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=481.28s)]
*  Yeah, there could be. [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=483.92s)]
*  But the difference is in the Republican Party, you both have to be good at the hand wringing [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=485.56s)]
*  and that politicking, but also speak like someone like Donald Trump, speak to the base [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=490.1s)]
*  of the Republican Party. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=495.52s)]
*  And there is not a candidate at this point who is good at the hand shaking and kissing [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=496.68s)]
*  babies and also that is charming and voters really like them and can give that red meat [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=501.03999999999996s)]
*  to the base. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=508.44s)]
*  Rhonda Santus isn't it. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=509.44s)]
*  Chris Christie, he is not liked by the base of the Republican Party. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=511.15999999999997s)]
*  And so finding someone who can toe that line at this point in this primary process doesn't [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=514.64s)]
*  exist. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=518.72s)]
*  Carlos, I mean, it's such an important point. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=519.72s)]
*  And I mean, we've got a big test coming up. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=522.68s)]
*  The August debate, right, is the first big test, a question of whether folks will stand [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=524.92s)]
*  on that debate stage again, end of August. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=530.52s)]
*  But then you've also got no labels out there because they are still threatening to mount [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=533.36s)]
*  this third party campaign. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=536.68s)]
*  I understand the notion of giving people who don't like the two party system options, but [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=539.0s)]
*  I personally think what no labels is doing is slightly disingenuous. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=544.12s)]
*  And I mean, their main argument is that they will drop their bid if Joe Biden is polling [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=548.4799999999999s)]
*  ahead of the Republican nominee in the spring. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=553.1800000000001s)]
*  We all here know there will be no Republican nominee in the spring. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=556.5s)]
*  So how do you think no labels just will affect the primary process for the Republican Party [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=559.1s)]
*  going forward? [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=568.02s)]
*  Well, it's hard to predict because this is kind of a new exercise. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=569.02s)]
*  I mean, it's been done a few times in the past. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=573.9s)]
*  But right now, Simone, if you look at the polling, you almost have to forgive a group [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=577.02s)]
*  like no labels for pursuing this because most Americans do not want another head to head [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=581.5s)]
*  between Donald Trump and Joe Biden. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=587.9000000000001s)]
*  The numbers are there. [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=590.38s)]
*  They're clear. [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=591.38s)]
*  Most Americans reject those two choices. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=592.38s)]
*  So no labels believes that this is the election to try this, that this is the time where it [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=594.14s)]
*  might work. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=600.34s)]
*  Now, the concern that many have, it's true. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=601.34s)]
*  This could benefit Donald Trump if it does split Democrats. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=604.1800000000001s)]
*  In the GOP primary, I don't think this effort is going to have much of an impact. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=608.62s)]
*  I don't think voters are going to contemplate this as they go to the polls early next year. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=613.9s)]
*  The big question, Simone, and you mentioned this debate that's coming up in August. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=619.66s)]
*  Can anyone break through? [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=623.38s)]
*  Can anyone distinguish themselves from Donald Trump in a way that does not alienate the [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=625.1s)]
*  Trump base, which people need a portion of that base in order to win? [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=630.3s)]
*  Is there a new dynamic candidate? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=634.42s)]
*  I'm biased. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHyvqrmWoCQ&t=636.3s)]
