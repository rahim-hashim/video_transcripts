Video Description: “He’s got a tragic flaw. Which is, that because of his natural flair for authoritarianism he loves to cover up and apologize for men in power who abuse their power to vicious ends. He did that with the sexual abuser on the wresting team back in Ohio. And of course, he has devoted his career recently to covering up all of the constitutional crimes and offenses and outrages committed by Donald Trump. I don’t quite know what that psychological characteristic is that drives him to do that, but he has a real penchant for defending people who take power and abuse it. And it’s not a good sign,” says Jamie Raskin on his colleague Jim Jordan.

# Rep. Jamie Raskin on Jim Jordan’s ‘tragic flaw’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ)
*  Democratic Congressman Jamie Raskin of Maryland serves with Jim Jordan on the House Oversight Committee, where he's the ranking member, and he joins me now. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=0.0s)]
*  Jim Jordan, right temperament to be Speaker of the House, Congressman? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=7.34s)]
*  Well, Jim Jordan is polemical and pugilistic and combative in committee. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=12.82s)]
*  We shouldn't kid ourselves because he's not without talent and a certain kind of rhetorical flair. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=22.66s)]
*  He's got a tragic flaw, which is that because of his natural authoritarianism, he loves to cover up and apologize for men in power who abuse their power to vicious ends. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=29.66s)]
*  And he did that with the sexual abuser on the wrestling team back in Ohio. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=45.22s)]
*  And of course, he has devoted his career recently to covering up all of the constitutional crimes and offenses and outrages committed by Donald Trump. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=52.26s)]
*  And I don't quite know what that psychological characteristic is that drives him to do that. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=62.620000000000005s)]
*  But he has a real penchant for defending people who take power and abuse it. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=68.3s)]
*  And it's not a good sign. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=73.1s)]
*  He is not any kind of real budget deficit hawk. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=75.66s)]
*  He gladly votes for continuing resolutions. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=80.42s)]
*  And so he he really is a right wing authoritarian culture warrior who mirrors Donald Trump in his basic temperament and political commitments. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=84.58s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, the fact that Trump he's been endorsed by Trump and Gates now and we got some new reporting today that back at the original election of speaker, the one that went through 15 ballots for Kevin McCarthy, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=96.74000000000001s)]
*  that Trump was toying the idea of running for it himself, that he he saw the power of television. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=108.5s)]
*  A close Trump adviser told me he saw how galvanizing it was, how mesmerizing it was. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=115.06s)]
*  Everybody was watching it. Right. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=119.14s)]
*  That's when Trump realizes it's the biggest reality show in America. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=120.66s)]
*  He could sit up there like celebrity apprentice and be the apprentice with him with a big ass gavel. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=123.30000000000001s)]
*  This this to me sort of captures the problem and is not unrelated to Jim Jordan's appearances on Fox and not unrelated to the motion to dismiss by Matt Gates and not unrelated to the [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=127.9s)]
*  entire Democratic crisis we find ourselves in, which is the incentives for these folks seem wildly misaligned. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=138.02s)]
*  Well, yeah, I mean, it's all about ego for the ones who get into office. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=147.9s)]
*  There's no political program. There's no mission for the country. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=152.94s)]
*  Trump, according to one Republican who spoke to me about it off the record, was actually deeply interested in running for speaker. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=155.54000000000002s)]
*  But he was blocked both by Republican Party rules, which say that you can't run if you are currently under indictment for a felony that would land you in jail for two years or more, which is a nice touch for their rules. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=163.14s)]
*  I like that. But he's also barred, of course, by Section three of the 14th Amendment, the Constitution, which says if you've sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution and violated it by engaging in insurrection or rebellion, [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=177.74s)]
*  you shall never be allowed the whole federal or state office again. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=189.62s)]
*  And the speakership, although it's not confined to members of Congress, is nonetheless a federal office. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=192.70000000000002s)]
*  And I think you would be barred from it. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=197.98000000000002s)]
*  But the problem is exactly what you were saying, Chris, which is that, look, what do you have in Congress today? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=200.38000000000002s)]
*  We've got two hundred and twelve Democrats who are unified, focused, and we've got a program for the country. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=206.70000000000002s)]
*  Then you've got an extreme mega wing, which Matt Gaetz exemplifies, which is literally taking orders on the phone from Donald Trump, like shut down the government to shut down my prosecutions. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=212.94s)]
*  Then you've got around one hundred and eighty five or one hundred and ninety right wing Republicans, many of whom call themselves mega. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=226.38s)]
*  But they basically are willing to do whatever the mega terrorist wing, as you put it, is demanding. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=233.38s)]
*  And so they're willing to go with it. But there's still about a dozen moderate, critical thinking Republicans left. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=241.54s)]
*  And those are the people that we're desperately trying to reach out to to say, can you support Hakeem Jeffries, who is a principled, effective, efficient leader for speaker? [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=248.01999999999998s)]
*  And we will put the House and the country back on a firm course. And if they can't do that, I don't know. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=259.21999999999997s)]
*  Maybe we could talk about Liz Cheney. We could talk about some other people who would be Republicans if they can't bring themselves to vote for a Democrat. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=265.06s)]
*  But we know there are around a dozen Republicans who are appalled by the authoritarian direction of their caucus. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=272.29999999999995s)]
*  Yeah. And I mean, again, I think that to me, the sort of disqualifying vote, although Kevin McCarthy took the same vote as to see if Salis, if I'm not mistaken, he did. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=280.53999999999996s)]
*  Is that vote on, you know, on January 6th? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=290.34000000000003s)]
*  I mean, to to be in that chamber, to watch what happened, to watch what the president did. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=293.94s)]
*  And they everyone was there. You guys are all there. Right. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=298.82s)]
*  The cops getting their heads bashed in, the president painting a target on his vice president, not sending the crowd home to be taken to safety and then come back into that building that had been so desecrated and rampaged and vote for the coup. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=301.34000000000003s)]
*  As a majority, those members did mean that to me is that's a disqualifying vote to be speaker of the House. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=315.46s)]
*  Now, we already have Kevin McCarthy, but. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=321.58s)]
*  Well, that's what was so astounding about McCarthy. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  He literally placed a call to Donald Trump from his office, which was being besieged and ransacked, begging him to call off the mob. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=328.06s)]
*  And everybody knows Trump's response was, well, maybe they just care a little bit more about a fair election than you do, Kevin. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=336.58s)]
*  And yet, even though he knew to call Donald Trump, who was the mastermind of the whole thing, to call it off, he could not bring himself to join Liz Cheney, who was the number three person in the Republican hierarchy to vote to impeach Donald Trump, even though he said on the floor that Trump was responsible. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=342.26s)]
*  And then, of course, you know, his caving into Trump only intensified. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=358.58s)]
*  And after that, you know, he went down to Mar-a-Lago and kissed the ring. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=363.58s)]
*  And then after the gavel changed hands, he, of course, turned over the security tapes to Fox News so they could continue to promote whatever their conspiracy theory du jour was. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=367.53999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, everyone, Kevin McCarthy, Jim Jordan should talk to place a call. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=380.09999999999997s)]
*  You talk to Kevin McCarthy, he should place a call to Jeff Sessions tonight. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=386.9s)]
*  See how it went to hit your wagon to the Trump train. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=390.82s)]
*  See how he ended up in the end. [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=395.62s)]
*  Just make a call. [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=396.82s)]
*  Jamie Raskin, Congressman from Maryland. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=398.42s)]
*  Always a pleasure to have you. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=400.34s)]
*  Thank you, sir. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yRUU05BIzRQ&t=401.34s)]
