# ‘Frankly, I’d rather be us right now’: AOC and Shawn Fain on final 2024 stretch
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY)
*  With just four days left to go, Vice President Harris is using the last few days to campaign [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=0.0s)]
*  through the critical swing states. Today, Harris spent the entire day campaigning throughout Wisconsin [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=4.0s)]
*  in an effort to reach out to voters, specifically union workers in that state, to make the case [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=8.8s)]
*  why they should vote for her. While Harris is in Wisconsin, she's got folks in Michigan at the same [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=12.72s)]
*  time making the case for her. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York and Sean [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=17.68s)]
*  Fain, as President of the United Auto Workers Union, which has endorsed the Harris Walls ticket, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=22.96s)]
*  are in Detroit where they are speaking to voters today. They both join me tonight from Michigan in [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=27.36s)]
*  their first joint televised interview. It's great to have you guys on the program. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=32.8s)]
*  Thanks for having us. Hey, it's great to be here. First, just a congresswoman, just like I've been [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=38.56s)]
*  doing this, everyone just a vibe check for people. I've been in the studio, so I don't know what's [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=43.84s)]
*  going on. You tell me how it feels. I know you've been doing a ton of campaigning across the country. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=48.16s)]
*  How are you feeling about things? I mean, we know that this race is going to be very, very tight, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=53.6s)]
*  but as I said and as we talked about tonight at UAW, when it comes down to the margin of effort, [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=59.92s)]
*  I'm going to be on the side of UAW and working people every time. And so our side is working [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=67.52s)]
*  hard. Frankly, I'd rather be us right now because we've got people who are really busting their [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=72.96000000000001s)]
*  behinds and knocking every single door out here in the city of Detroit. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=79.44s)]
*  I was looking at data today, Sean, about fundraising and spending, and I really think it hasn't quite [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=83.36s)]
*  sunk into people that three billionaires have given almost $400 million more than, if I've [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=90.32s)]
*  got this correct, all of the small dollar donations combined for Trump to try to get him into office. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=99.52s)]
*  I want to play for you what one of them, Elon Musk, said about the living within our means and [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=107.75999999999999s)]
*  hardship that might be coming for people if Trump's elected. Take a listen. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=112.88s)]
*  We have to reduce spending to live within our means. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=120.32s)]
*  That necessarily involves some temporary hardship, but it will ensure long-term prosperity. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=127.84s)]
*  Are voters and the workers in your union hearing that from Elon Musk? [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=133.68s)]
*  Well, I think he's got it backwards. We've been enduring long-term [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=140.08s)]
*  going backwards for decades due to the same policies that Trump's a champion for. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=144.0s)]
*  And what you're talking about, the three billionaires that have given hundreds of [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=148.96s)]
*  millions of dollars to Trump's campaign, that's what this election is all about. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=153.36s)]
*  There's two very distinct differences here. You've got people, two people in this race, [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=157.84s)]
*  Kamala Harris is one of us. She knows what work is. She's worked at McDonald's. She didn't play [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=161.92s)]
*  dress up like Trump did. She's actually done it. She's worked her way through the ranks. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=166.72s)]
*  She's spent a lifetime serving people. Donald Trump has had everything handed to him. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=171.83999999999997s)]
*  He's a representative of the billionaire class. He doesn't give a damn about working class people. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=175.83999999999997s)]
*  And that's what this is all about. Congresswoman, sometimes it seems to me policy is [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=179.67999999999998s)]
*  sort of maddeningly remote from the discourse of the election. And there was a sort of amazing [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=185.44s)]
*  moment with a fellow member of the New York congressional caucus today, Brandon Williams, [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=190.08s)]
*  Republican, who's trying in a very contested race. The speaker came to his district and he [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=193.52s)]
*  got asked about the Chips Act, bipartisan bill. It's put a lot of investment, including, I think, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=198.08s)]
*  investment in that district for a big micron new set super center. The speaker says, I think Trump's [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=202.72000000000003s)]
*  probably going to try to repeal it. Yes. Brandon Williams, it has to get up and be like, no, no, [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=208.4s)]
*  no, no, we like we're good Chips Act. Then afterwards they have to put a statement out [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=212.96s)]
*  trying to walk it back. And I just thought it's so rare to see the actual policy here [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=217.20000000000002s)]
*  front and center in the campaign. Yeah, absolutely. Well, you know, it's it's [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=222.32s)]
*  the Chips Act is not a remote and far away thing for workers in Buffalo or workers right here in [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=229.68s)]
*  Michigan that benefit from the manufacturing plants and the jobs and especially the union jobs [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=236.16s)]
*  that result and are created that can that people can actually take and will help them, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=242.32s)]
*  you know, put food on the table without having to work triple or double overtime in order to [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=247.76s)]
*  accomplish that. And so, you know, some people may hear Chips Act or some kind of vague policy, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=253.92s)]
*  but people in Buffalo, people in upstate New York, people in Michigan, they hear about the plant that [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=259.76s)]
*  they work at. And when you have the speaker of the house, the Republican speaker of the house, [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=265.03999999999996s)]
*  roll up to Buffalo, New York and say we are going to shut down the plants that give you all your [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=271.04s)]
*  jobs. You better believe people know what he's talking about and what I love about it. And what [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=276.72s)]
*  I would like to thank Speaker Johnson for is his honesty and his forthrightness about what they [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=281.92s)]
*  plan to do with a Republican majority in the House of Representatives. And I want everyone in Buffalo [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=288.8s)]
*  to know you heard it straight from the horse's mouth. And we'll see exactly what happens if we [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=293.84000000000003s)]
*  allow a Republican majority in the House and a Donald Trump presidency. Let me just in case [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=299.44s)]
*  people think that I'm misstating this because they are like moonwalking away from it right now. Let [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=303.44s)]
*  me just play Mike Johnson answering the question. Sean, take a listen to this. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=307.36s)]
*  The former president has said that he doesn't support the Chips and Science Act. You voted [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=314.08s)]
*  against it. If you have a Republican majority in Congress and Trump in the White House, [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=317.52s)]
*  will you guys try to repeal that law? I expect that we probably will, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=320.72s)]
*  but we haven't developed that part of the agenda yet. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=324.88s)]
*  Brian, I'm going to go from the background. Sean, this really strikes me as an important part. It [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=327.68s)]
*  really does seem like the Biden-Harris administration, if you look at all the policy, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=333.44s)]
*  there really has been a focus on investment, rebuilding the country's manufacturing base, [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=337.2s)]
*  good unionized jobs. And the Trump agenda, as far as I can tell, is like an enormous amount of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  tariffs and tax cuts for billionaires. And again, does that come through? Like, do you feel like [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=348.08s)]
*  when you talk to the people that are members of your union, that they're aware of that, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=353.28s)]
*  or does that seem remote? Look, with our campaign we've been running for the last few months, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=357.11999999999995s)]
*  we've seen numbers drastically increase. A majority of our members already supported Kamala Harris, [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=364.64s)]
*  but it's went up by over 20% just in the last month because we're putting that message out there. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=371.03999999999996s)]
*  And that's what this, again, Trump can't decide which side he's on. I mean, we know which side [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=375.67999999999995s)]
*  he's on, but like he can't make up his mind. You know, at the Republican convention, he talked [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=381.92s)]
*  about, you know, railed against the UAW for allowing electric vehicles. But then all of a sudden, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=386.0s)]
*  Elon Musk gives him $45 million a month, and all of a sudden he's for electric vehicles. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=391.28000000000003s)]
*  You know, these guys can't decide which side they're on or what they believe. It's what people pay [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=396.32s)]
*  them. That's what's going to force what they believe. So, you know, Kamala Harris and with [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=400.24s)]
*  the Biden administration, they've invested in this nation. Donald Trump left workers behind when he [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=404.40000000000003s)]
*  was president. He did nothing to stop manufacturing plants leaving this country. With the Harris and [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=409.2s)]
*  Biden administration, we've seen a bigger investment in this country in manufacturing than I've ever [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=416.08s)]
*  seen in my lifetime. So, you know, they walk the walk. Donald Trump is all talk. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=420.4s)]
*  Mm-hmm. And I think we've seen that too with Elon Musk. I mean, they, Donald Trump and Elon Musk [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=424.24s)]
*  went live together on a stream and joked about how they were going, not even joked, they were very [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=430.08s)]
*  serious about how you need to lay off union workers or any worker the moment you even sense [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=436.08s)]
*  the fact that they may want to organize for better wages and conditions in their workplace. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=441.44s)]
*  Elon Musk is a union buster and Donald Trump is a scab, and the two of them put together cannot be [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=445.84s)]
*  put anywhere near any sort of influence in the White House. And on the note of Elon Musk talking [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=452.24s)]
*  about how we need to live within our means, suddenly I find it very interesting that that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=458.47999999999996s)]
*  does not apply to him with the billions of dollars in government contracts that he seeks [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=462.4s)]
*  to secure for himself and the billions of dollars in tax cuts that he seeks to exempt himself [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=466.56s)]
*  from paying to contribute for everyday people's schools, roads, bridges, and more. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=473.52s)]
*  And you cannot try to influence American politics if you don't want to contribute [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=478.56s)]
*  to the everyday lives of American people. And to Elon Musk, we have one message, which is get your [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=484.15999999999997s)]
*  money out of politics. It's no good here. Yeah, I will say you can try. The question is whether [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=490.16s)]
*  you can succeed. That's what we're going to find out. Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=496.16s)]
*  and Sean Fade, I appreciate you taking the time on a very busy evening. Thank you very much. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X3AZ1YhcmAY&t=501.12s)]
