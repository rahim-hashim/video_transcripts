Video Description: “I prayed that those folks there would see with the wisdom of Solomon what this country needed, which was to disqualify this man,” says impeachment manager Madeleine Dean on Senate Republicans. “Look where we are now because they would not do their duty, because they didn’t have the wisdom. They were instead praying for power.”

# ‘Look where we are now’ Congresswoman rips Senate Republicans who acquitted Trump
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 04, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8)
*  Congresswoman Madeline Dean is a Democrat of Pennsylvania. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=0.0s)]
*  She served as a manager in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=2.64s)]
*  She joins me now. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=5.84s)]
*  Well, have you thought about that impeachment as much as I have been in the last few days? [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=7.84s)]
*  Oh, I've thought about it an awful lot, Chris. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  Thank you for having me on. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=16.56s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=18.6s)]
*  And we as managers, as we prepared the case with the able lead of Jamie Raskin, so faithful [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=19.88s)]
*  to the Constitution, we really believe that this evidence was so overwhelming that, of [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=28.04s)]
*  course, 100 senators should have voted guilty. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=34.92s)]
*  We knew what was going on politically, but what we wanted was for a guilty verdict and [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=40.4s)]
*  then the opportunity, as you say, to disqualify him by way of a separate vote for further [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=45.480000000000004s)]
*  office. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=50.879999999999995s)]
*  You're absolutely right. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=52.0s)]
*  There were other constitutional means, the 14th Amendment within subrection, the 25th [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=53.0s)]
*  Amendment. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=57.199999999999996s)]
*  And we have learned that some secretaries did begin to speak about disqualifying him, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=57.879999999999995s)]
*  showing that he was unfit for office. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=63.919999999999995s)]
*  The founders gave us these levers, the break the glass levers in the case of this level of [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=66.28s)]
*  corruption and criminality. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=72.52s)]
*  And I have to tell you, that last day, when each member of the Senate, you know how they [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=74.75999999999999s)]
*  did it, they stood to cast their votes. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=79.96s)]
*  I went running back in from the little war room where we prepared to see and watch and [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=82.80000000000001s)]
*  listen to their votes. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=88.72s)]
*  And I watched as Mitch McConnell stood in his place, said not guilty, sat down. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=90.72s)]
*  When we went back to the war room, within minutes of the conclusion of that vote, as [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=96.68s)]
*  you say, 57-43, Mitch McConnell stood and gave a prepared speech that said the president [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=102.60000000000001s)]
*  is practically and morally responsible, effectively speaking out of both sides of his mouth. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=110.68s)]
*  I think about it a lot. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=118.84s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very stirring speech after he just voted not guilty. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=119.84s)]
*  And what is important to me is we face ourselves with this remarkable situation, right? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=123.56s)]
*  The multiple indictments and the most important to me, obviously, Jack Smith's indictment [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=130.48000000000002s)]
*  for the crimes as laid out in the impeachment and then in the select committees report. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=133.84s)]
*  That, you know, criminal conviction is not the only means at our disposal. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=139.24s)]
*  The Constitution contemplates precisely the most appropriate sanction here before this [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=144.60000000000002s)]
*  whole thing. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=151.72s)]
*  We got to this point, which is disqualification. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=152.72s)]
*  Like, it is contemplated by the Constitution, the notion that certain people should be barred [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=154.08s)]
*  from office. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=159.44s)]
*  And if ever such a person existed, it seems to me this man is he. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=160.44s)]
*  You know, I was thinking as we were preparing the case and when I would be off and not having [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=166.44s)]
*  a role but just would be observing and preparing, I was thinking, I was praying, frankly, that [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=172.04s)]
*  the members of the Senate would have and call for the wisdom of Solomon. [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=177.88s)]
*  Do you know what Solomon asked for? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=181.20000000000002s)]
*  He asked for an open heart. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=183.70000000000002s)]
*  He asked for wisdom and an open heart. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=185.92000000000002s)]
*  And God said, we're really impressed. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=189.92000000000002s)]
*  I'm very impressed with that. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=193.4s)]
*  You didn't ask for power, for riches, for long life. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=195.02s)]
*  I prayed that those folks there would see with the wisdom of Solomon what this country [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=198.78s)]
*  needed, which was to disqualify this man, to hold him accountable, to hold him guilty [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=203.70000000000002s)]
*  for incitement of insurrection and disqualify him. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=209.58s)]
*  Look where we are now, because they would not do their duty, because they didn't have [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=213.58s)]
*  the wisdom. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=217.70000000000002s)]
*  They were instead praying for power. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=218.70000000000002s)]
*  And I don't know what else. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=221.46s)]
*  How do you think about all this, Unfull? [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=224.82s)]
*  I mean, I guess how seriously do you take the threat? [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=226.42s)]
*  I mean, he's a frontrunner for the nomination. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=229.34s)]
*  We're a polarized country. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=232.78s)]
*  If you win one of the major party nominations, you're, you know, within a coin flip. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=233.78s)]
*  It's extraordinarily. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=239.42s)]
*  You know, you probably start with 40 percent of the vote. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=240.42s)]
*  It's extraordinarily frightening. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=244.38s)]
*  You see the polls that have President Biden and the former guy at a dead heat. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=246.9s)]
*  I believe that will shake out and become very, very different because the economy has moved [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=253.14s)]
*  in the right direction. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=257.65999999999997s)]
*  We have passed incredible resources that are going into American communities, into American [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=258.9s)]
*  homes and businesses. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=265.06s)]
*  So I think that will change. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=266.82s)]
*  But you are right to sound the alarm. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=268.4s)]
*  This is a very scary time. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=271.24s)]
*  If this man is gets the nomination, if somehow delays these trials, I have a feeling this [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=273.56s)]
*  Judge in D.C. is not going to be played with. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=280.14000000000004s)]
*  But if somehow he gets the nomination or somehow would win the election. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=283.22s)]
*  The threat to our democracy is so grave, I don't even want to talk about it. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=291.3s)]
*  You have raised some of those things. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=295.94s)]
*  He says it out loud. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=297.78000000000003s)]
*  You know, I was thinking of his inaugural address. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=299.5s)]
*  Do you remember what he said? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=301.98s)]
*  The stunning line was this American carnage stops now. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=303.02000000000004s)]
*  Do you know what I heard when he said that? [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=308.46000000000004s)]
*  This American carnage starts now. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=311.02000000000004s)]
*  He is in the midst of American carnage. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=314.3s)]
*  People have lost their lives. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=317.02000000000004s)]
*  And we have people like McCarthy and McConnell taking a backseat to all of this. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=319.26s)]
*  McCarthy entertaining the idea of resolutions to erase his impeachments as though they never [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=324.54s)]
*  happened. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=333.02000000000004s)]
*  Tell that to the officers who lost their lives, to their families who lost their lives, the [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=334.42s)]
*  officers who were so severely wounded, to all of us who were in the Capitol terrorized, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=338.94s)]
*  your colleagues who were terrorized, the staffers who cleaned up the mess. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=344.62s)]
*  You can't erase this part of history. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=349.54s)]
*  And we must not let this former president, this criminal former president who cares nothing [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=351.4s)]
*  for democracy, get back into office. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=356.76s)]
*  Thank you, Congresswoman Madeline Dean of Pennsylvania, who was one of the impeachment [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=360.9s)]
*  managers in that very important and I thought well presented second impeachment of the former [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=363.85999999999996s)]
*  guy. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=369.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=370.21999999999997s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=823xAmMBpr8&t=390.9s)]
