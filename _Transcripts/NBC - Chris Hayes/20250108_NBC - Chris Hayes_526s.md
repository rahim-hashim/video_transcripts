# Marjorie Taylor Greene champions bill on 'Gulf of America' name change
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 08, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI)
*  He's got his eye on a country, an island, and a canal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=0.0s)]
*  If you look at Greenland, for example, if the people there are being treated horribly, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=4.92s)]
*  I would bet the people would probably vote for an alliance with the U.S. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=9.24s)]
*  Canada does seem ripe for the picking. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=13.040000000000001s)]
*  His argument about the Panama Canal is long overdue. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=15.08s)]
*  You better bet we are absolutely going to change the Gulf of Mexico to the Gulf of America. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=18.0s)]
*  The fact that they don't want to become part of America makes me want to make them. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=24.4s)]
*  Jesse Waters never took no for an answer. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=30.96s)]
*  With less than two weeks until he is sworn in, Donald Trump isn't talking about balancing [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=33.32s)]
*  the budget or lowering the price of eggs anymore. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=38.339999999999996s)]
*  Remember that? [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=40.76s)]
*  He's going to lower the price of groceries. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=41.76s)]
*  He won because groceries were high. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=42.84s)]
*  Now he's going to make them lower, right? [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=44.08s)]
*  No. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=45.959999999999994s)]
*  He's talking about annexing overseas territories and then MAGA is scurrying to praise Trump's [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=46.959999999999994s)]
*  social media rambles about buying Greenland and taking back the Panama Canal as well [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=52.08s)]
*  as making Canada the 51st state, maybe adding Mexico or renaming the Gulf of Mexico to imply [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=56.44s)]
*  U.S. ownership. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=61.68s)]
*  The latest installment of this genuinely weird drama came yesterday as Donald Trump Jr. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=63.44s)]
*  flew to Greenland as a PR stunt. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=69.32s)]
*  The Republican-run House Foreign Affairs Committee tweeted and deleted a post celebrating Trump's [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=74.92s)]
*  territorial ambitions with a headline from Rupert Murdoch's paper, quote, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=79.8s)]
*  President Trump has the biggest dreams for America and it's un-American to be afraid [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=83.72s)]
*  of big dreams. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=87.96s)]
*  And I'm going to be honest with you, I don't quite sure know what to make of this. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=90.16s)]
*  At one level, it's an obvious troll. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=96.08s)]
*  At another level, it's like another weird loyalty test for his faithful. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=99.08s)]
*  Like he says a thing and then they all are like, yes, Sean Hannity, I'm the expert on [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=102.48s)]
*  political public opinion in Greenland. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=106.24s)]
*  So they have to sort of adopt his rantings. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=108.80000000000001s)]
*  I also think there's something serious here. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=111.32000000000001s)]
*  In his first term, Trump floated the Greenland balloon repeatedly. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=114.24000000000001s)]
*  Like it was a real thing. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=117.44s)]
*  It wasn't like a thing he publicized. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=118.76s)]
*  It clearly gnawed at him. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  Second of all, if he finishes out this upcoming term, he'll be 82 years old. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=122.32000000000001s)]
*  The guy's the oldest man ever elected to be president. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=126.04s)]
*  I think he's thinking about his legacy in whatever strange way he thinks of that. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=129.28s)]
*  He's a property speculator. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=132.92000000000002s)]
*  And then there's also the third aspect. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=135.20000000000002s)]
*  This doesn't come out of nowhere. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=136.72s)]
*  Ronald Reagan rose to prominence in national right-wing politics on like demagoguing about [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=138.12s)]
*  the Panama Canal. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=142.35999999999999s)]
*  And right-wing authoritarian, authoritarian movements and leaders are all, as a rule, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=144.0s)]
*  obsessed with conquest and territorial expansion everywhere. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=149.76s)]
*  You could, for instance, read a single book about the long centuries of constant bloodshed [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=153.36s)]
*  and mayhem between European powers over their territories. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=159.48s)]
*  Or about World War I or read a single book about World War II. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=163.2s)]
*  This is what autocratic leaders and demagogues do. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=167.88s)]
*  They need external enemies. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=169.95999999999998s)]
*  They need conquest. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=171.28s)]
*  It was out of all that bloodshed, tens of millions of people, that an international [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=172.95999999999998s)]
*  norm evolved, a norm still too often violated, yet important nonetheless. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=178.64s)]
*  That says you don't just take over other people's land. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=183.72s)]
*  Lydia Polagrine is an opinion columnist in the New York Times and the co-host of the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=188.32s)]
*  Matter of Opinion podcast. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=191.44s)]
*  She recently participated in a conversation with some of her more conservative colleagues [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=193.84s)]
*  on Trump in crisis mode on the world stage. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=196.76s)]
*  And she joins me now. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=199.48s)]
*  And you've also served as a journalist in a bunch of places around the world. [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=200.48s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=203.44s)]
*  Well, first of all, what do you make of all this? [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=204.44s)]
*  I mean, I think that on one level, it is a lot of trolling, right? [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=206.76s)]
*  And it's also some sort of prime distraction. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=211.52s)]
*  It's a way to, I think, essentially act on the world stage in the way his apparent hero [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=214.2s)]
*  Xi Jinping and Vladimir Putin, these autocratic rulers that he has admired and talked about. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=222.28s)]
*  He sees them going after bits of territory, trying to reshape the map of the world. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=228.36s)]
*  But I think when you talk about making America great again, it's really a backward-looking [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=233.56s)]
*  exercise. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=238.20000000000002s)]
*  It's this idea of going back to some legendary time when things were so wonderful and great. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=239.20000000000002s)]
*  And in this case, we talk about tariffs. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=247.20000000000002s)]
*  We talk about other things. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=249.5s)]
*  And we're really talking about the 19th century. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=250.64s)]
*  And we're talking about going back to a period where— [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=254.64s)]
*  Peake McKinley, basically. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=256.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=257.76s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=258.76s)]
*  And so we're talking about going back to a period where it was a kind of smash and grab. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=259.76s)]
*  And everybody was trying to kind of find as much territory as they could in the world. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=263.1s)]
*  And that was the way that you got to security. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=267.8s)]
*  How did all of that end? [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=270.2s)]
*  It ended in World War II and the Holocaust. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=271.3s)]
*  It ended in just astonishing human suffering. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=274.18s)]
*  And that gave birth to an international system that allowed us to find ways to resolve these [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=279.38s)]
*  kinds of disputes and talk to one another. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=284.24s)]
*  We don't need Greenland. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=285.9s)]
*  I mean, we are in a NATO alliance with Denmark. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=286.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=290.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=291.9s)]
*  All of it—everything makes sense if you're like, let me put on my 1893 cap about how I [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=292.9s)]
*  would think about this issue. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=299.78s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=301.3s)]
*  You actually—there's a very clarifying like tariffs and imperial conquest. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=302.3s)]
*  I mean, this thing about the UN—I'm going to just read part of the UN Charter. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=306.76000000000005s)]
*  And one of my unified theories for why everything is so messed up in the world is literally [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  losing the like actual generation that remembered the horrors of World War II. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  And some of the lessons that that gave about fascism and great power conflict. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  The United Nations Charter preamble, [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=325.52000000000004s)]
*  We the peoples of the United Nations, [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=327.04s)]
*  Determined to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=328.48s)]
*  Which twice in our lifetime have brought untold sorrow to mankind, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=331.64000000000004s)]
*  And to practice tolerance and live together in peace with one another's good neighbors, [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=334.88s)]
*  Have resolved to combine our efforts to accomplish these aims. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=338.02s)]
*  You know, grabbing other people's land. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=342.02s)]
*  And the way—that's the other thing about this troll. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=345.5s)]
*  The Greenland thing is he talks about it a little the way that Putin talked about Crimea. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=348.46s)]
*  Totally. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=352.9s)]
*  Like, oh, well, if you ask them, you know, they really kind of want to join us. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=353.9s)]
*  And I'm sure maybe you've had a little plebiscite over there. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=356.42s)]
*  Maybe they'd vote for us. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=359.46s)]
*  It's the same thing. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=360.46s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=361.46s)]
*  And I think, like, we don't actually have to go that far back, right? [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=362.76s)]
*  I mean, my mother's from Ethiopia, right? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=366.15999999999997s)]
*  And Ethiopia and Eritrea have had this kind of ongoing border conflict. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=368.4s)]
*  Ethiopia wants to have access to the sea on the Red Sea and so on and so forth. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=373.28s)]
*  You know, two of my uncles died fighting in those wars between, you know, Ethiopia and Eritrea. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=377.59999999999997s)]
*  And for what? [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=383.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, this is why we have these— [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=384.79999999999995s)]
*  Conquest and territory. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=385.79999999999995s)]
*  Well, but this is why we have these international agreements, these ways to work out these problems. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=386.79999999999995s)]
*  You know, I mean, look, you know, if we put tariffs on Denmark over this Greenland fantasy, [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=391.7s)]
*  the only thing that's going to happen is that Ozempic is going to become more expensive. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=398.86s)]
*  I mean, this is absolutely sad. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=401.42s)]
*  Which is an actual thing, yes. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=402.42s)]
*  No, absolutely. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=403.90000000000003s)]
*  They're the ones who make it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=404.90000000000003s)]
*  You know, the idea of if you give a sort of genuinely psychologically damaged and broken [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=405.90000000000003s)]
*  person the biggest bully stick in the world, that's sort of what you get. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=414.18s)]
*  And I think a lot of people are like, ah, he's bullying. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=419.24s)]
*  But again, that point you made about Xi and Putin, the kind of liberal internationalism [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=421.8s)]
*  that is so often honored in the breach and is so hypocritical and leads to horrible atrocities [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=429.88s)]
*  and you know, the people look the other way, it's still better than what came before. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=434.16s)]
*  And I think what Trump wants is what came before, where like no one's pretending and [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=439.56s)]
*  maybe we take our piece of the pie, Russia takes it, China does it, and we'll see what happens. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=443.72s)]
*  Well, and that's the thing, right? [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=448.3s)]
*  I mean, that's a whole way of viewing the world. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=449.3s)]
*  And it's a very old way, but it's also a way that I think there are a lot of players who [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=451.78000000000003s)]
*  would prefer to be operating in that world, right? [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=456.70000000000005s)]
*  I mean, you're talking about a world that is purely transactional, where there's no [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=458.78000000000003s)]
*  sort of agreed upon standards about how anybody is going to act. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=463.38000000000005s)]
*  And you know, I spent a lot of time focused on the developing world and the global south [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=467.18s)]
*  because that's my passion and where I've spent most of my time as a reporter. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=470.54s)]
*  And you know, you talk to officials from these countries and they're like, you know what, [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=474.3s)]
*  we're tired of lectures about human rights for the Americans. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=477.36s)]
*  And you know, you talk about, you know, you talk about your principles, but then you ignore [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=480.24s)]
*  them in Gaza and things like that. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=484.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=485.59999999999997s)]
*  So, so, you know, I do think that there is an audience for what Trump is selling. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=486.59999999999997s)]
*  And you know, absolutely. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=490.28s)]
*  China is in those parts of the world. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=491.28s)]
*  Russia is in those parts of the world. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=492.88s)]
*  And they're doing these, you know, these these deals. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=494.28s)]
*  And you've got other players, whether it's, you know, the charter and the poetics and [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=497.2s)]
*  just get what's yours. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=501.2s)]
*  Let's let's just do deals. [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=502.2s)]
*  Lydia Polgrain, thank you very much. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=504.2s)]
*  It's a pleasure. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=505.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kR_80w0iwuI&t=507.26s)]
