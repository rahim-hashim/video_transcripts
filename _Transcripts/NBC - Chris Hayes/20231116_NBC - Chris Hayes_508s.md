Video Description: National Security Council spokesman John Kirby: “It is true that a command and control node was underneath that hospital and that Hamas has used that hospital not only for storage of weapons, but also to house some of their fighters—we have no doubt in our mind, just from our own intelligence analysis, that Hamas is using that hospital.”

# Kirby ‘No doubt’ that Hamas is using hospital to house fighters
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM)
*  Today, President Biden addressed the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit in California, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=0.0s)]
*  following his meeting yesterday with Chinese President Xi Jinping. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=5.84s)]
*  The White House is touting a number of concrete deliverables from that meeting, including [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=9.040000000000001s)]
*  a new deal on restricting the flow of fentanyl and its precursor chemicals, the resumption [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  of military-to-military communications between Washington and Beijing, which had been suspended, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=18.76s)]
*  and even, perhaps most crucially, progress on a deal to bring new pandas to America's [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=24.64s)]
*  zoos. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=29.560000000000002s)]
*  But, of course, the summit takes place against the backdrop of the ongoing war and humanitarian [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  crisis in Gaza, which the president was once again faced questions over during a press [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=35.4s)]
*  conference last night. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=40.72s)]
*  John Kirby serves as deputy assistant to the president as well as coordinator for strategic [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=43.0s)]
*  communications at the National Security Council, and he joins me now. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=47.42s)]
*  It's great to have you in the program. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=51.28s)]
*  Thanks for joining us. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=52.28s)]
*  Thank you, Chris. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=54.92s)]
*  Good to be with you. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=55.42s)]
*  I want to start with a claim the president made last night during that press conference. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=57.32s)]
*  We played it earlier in which he said that Hamas had hidden a headquarters underneath [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=63.120000000000005s)]
*  the hospital. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=67.64s)]
*  Obviously, that's a contested claim, an intensely contested claim, and a high-stakes one because [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=68.64s)]
*  it gets to whether that's a legitimate military target. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=74.88s)]
*  And I wonder, since it is such an important and contested claim, if we can expect some [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=78.56s)]
*  proof will be furnished by American or Israeli officials. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=83.12s)]
*  Well, the Israelis have already, as you've seen, and I think you just went through before [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=89.16s)]
*  the commercial break talking about how they have made public their findings in the hospital. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=93.36s)]
*  I can't speak to specific intelligence other than to say that based on our own intelligence [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=98.16s)]
*  assessment, on our own collection and analysis of what we've seen, we believe that it isn't [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=103.88s)]
*  true. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=110.08s)]
*  We believe that a command and control node was underneath that hospital and that Hamas [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=111.08s)]
*  has used that hospital not only for storage of weapons but also to house some of their [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=115.52s)]
*  fighters. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=120.96s)]
*  So we have no doubt in our mind, just from our own intelligence analysis, that Hamas [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=121.96s)]
*  was using that hospital. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=126.88s)]
*  And look, that's out of their playbook. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=127.88s)]
*  This is what they do. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=130.12s)]
*  They find ways to headquarter themselves in civilian infrastructure, digging tunnels under [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=131.48s)]
*  placing innocent civilians in the crossfire between them and the IDF. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=136.44s)]
*  Just to follow up on that, obviously, sometimes intelligence can be wrong. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=142.96s)]
*  I mean, notably, I remember covering, of course, the strike after the brutal suicide bombing [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=146.16s)]
*  outside the Bagram, outside the Kabul air base, in which someone who the US intelligence [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=152.12s)]
*  believed was an ISIS fighter was actually just an innocent civilian happened. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=158.44s)]
*  It does seem important, I think, just for global public opinion, particularly, that [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=164.20000000000002s)]
*  people do get furnished some sort of tangible proof. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=169.4s)]
*  I mean, independent of whether the US government believes it, the Israeli government, there [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=172.24s)]
*  is quite a bit of global public attention being paid to this conflict and particularly [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=177.08s)]
*  the plight of the folks that were in that hospital. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=182.76000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, there is indeed. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=185.28s)]
*  You're absolutely right about that. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=188.16000000000003s)]
*  And as I said, the Israeli Defense Forces, this is their operation. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=189.16000000000003s)]
*  And while they're on the ground, they have been releasing imagery. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=193.76s)]
*  They have been taking camera crews in there and showing the things that they've been finding. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=195.51999999999998s)]
*  Again, it perfectly corroborates our own intelligence. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=199.51999999999998s)]
*  I don't have anything to announce tonight in terms of the release of any particular [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=202.2s)]
*  US intelligence. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=206.2s)]
*  I can just, again, assert that our own analysis corroborates the claim that Hamas was using [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=207.2s)]
*  this as a command and control note. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=212.04s)]
*  And again, I would remind, this is a common tactic for them. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=213.39999999999998s)]
*  This is a page out of their playbook. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=216.16s)]
*  They're deliberately placing patients and hospital staff at greater risk. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=217.76s)]
*  And I want to ask one more question on this, in particular in hospitals, but it applies [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=222.88s)]
*  to the broader contours of the conflict. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=226.96s)]
*  As you said, as Israeli officials have said, there are tunnels underneath Gaza, that there [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=230.12s)]
*  are civilian infrastructure that's been utilized for Hamas fighters. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=233.84s)]
*  There's videos the IDF has released from schools where they say they found rocket launch sites. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=238.04000000000002s)]
*  I want to play this clip because it's gotten a lot of attention about the targeting of [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=245.24s)]
*  civilian structures. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=248.56s)]
*  And it's by Anthony Blinken, and he's talking about the Russians in Ukraine. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=249.96s)]
*  And you've probably seen this. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=253.68s)]
*  It's been circulating a lot on social media where he's condemning the targeting of that [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=254.96s)]
*  civilian infrastructure. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=259.24s)]
*  Please take a look. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=260.44s)]
*  Bombing schools and hospitals and apartment buildings to rubble is not normal. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=263.6s)]
*  Stealing Ukrainian children from their families and giving them to people in Russia is not [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=268.4s)]
*  normal. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=272.68s)]
*  We must not let President Putin's callous a difference to human life become our own. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=275.32s)]
*  I guess the question becomes if there is Hamas military infrastructure embedded in civilian [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=280.76s)]
*  infrastructure, whether the U.S. has communicated to Israel what lengths they have to go to [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=288.0s)]
*  or what the lines are for what would make a piece of civilian infrastructure a legitimate [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=293.15999999999997s)]
*  military target. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=298.28s)]
*  I don't think there's a single conversation that we're having with our Israeli counterparts [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=301.4s)]
*  where we don't talk about and urge them to be as cautious and deliberate and careful [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=305.64s)]
*  as they can with respect to civilian infrastructure and, of course, civilian lives. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=309.88s)]
*  Urban warfare is difficult. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=315.03999999999996s)]
*  And we have experience at this of our own in Iraq and Afghanistan. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=316.03999999999996s)]
*  And we have shared our perspectives and our lessons learned. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=320.08s)]
*  And we urge them again to be as deliberate and careful as they can. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  I want to make two points here, though. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=326.32s)]
*  Every civilian killed, every civilian wounded, that's a tragedy. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=328.76s)]
*  We know there's a whole family that's grieving as a result. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=332.47999999999996s)]
*  And now there are many, many thousands of families that are grieving and hurting right [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=335.35999999999996s)]
*  now. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=339.0s)]
*  And we want all that suffering to stop. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=340.0s)]
*  That's why we're going to continue to talk to our Israeli counterparts about being careful [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=342.28s)]
*  and being deliberate in their targeting. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=346.0s)]
*  The second point I want to make is unlike the fight in Ukraine where the destruction [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=348.15999999999997s)]
*  of civilian infrastructure and the taking of civilian lives is actually a war aim of [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=353.98s)]
*  President Putin. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=359.34000000000003s)]
*  He wants to wipe out Ukraine's culture, history, and not just to mention their country. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=360.58000000000004s)]
*  That is also a war aim of Hamas. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=365.3s)]
*  That is what they did on October 7th, paragliding into a music festival and slaughtering innocent [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=367.94s)]
*  people in front of their family members. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=372.58000000000004s)]
*  They want to wipe Israel off the map. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=374.42s)]
*  It is not a war aim of the Israeli Defense Forces to kill innocent civilians and to destroy [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=376.78000000000003s)]
*  civilian infrastructure. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=381.82s)]
*  They are going about this in a very aggressive way. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=383.14s)]
*  And we are talking to them again about the way they do it. [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=385.97999999999996s)]
*  But it's important to remember the distinction here. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=388.8s)]
*  Hamas is actually committing war crimes by headquartering in hospitals. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=390.41999999999996s)]
*  The Israeli Defense Forces are not making it a war aim to kill innocent people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=393.94s)]
*  Let me ask you a question on China since that was the subject. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=398.38s)]
*  That was a huge news yesterday. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=402.82s)]
*  And just about for folks, we talked to John Brennan yesterday that don't understand what [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=404.62s)]
*  military to military communications mean and particularly what normalizing them means [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=408.53999999999996s)]
*  and what their significance is. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=413.0s)]
*  Why is that significant that those have been restored after being suspended? [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=415.12s)]
*  Man, it's a big deal. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=419.32s)]
*  I mean, to not have two of the most powerful militaries on the face of the planet in the [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=421.84s)]
*  most consequential bilateral relationship in the world, having aircraft operating in [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=426.88s)]
*  proximity, ships operating in proximity and not have an ability to pick up the phone and [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=431.84s)]
*  call somebody on the other side and explain what you're doing and why you're doing it [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=436.96s)]
*  and try to de-conflict. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=440.36s)]
*  That's a real dangerous precedent. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=441.88s)]
*  The president said that very clearly yesterday. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=444.2s)]
*  I mean, it could get into big trouble very, very quickly. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=446.56s)]
*  And so those communications have been shut down since Speaker Pelosi's visit to Taiwan. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=449.88s)]
*  And we're obviously glad now that that process is ongoing. [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=456.48s)]
*  And the thing about this, Chris, is it goes from the commander-in-chief down to a lower [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=459.6s)]
*  level. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JLpFUP5MKnM&t=463.48s)]
