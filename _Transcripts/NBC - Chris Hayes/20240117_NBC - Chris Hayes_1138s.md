# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 16
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. The very first votes of the 2024 election have now been cast. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=0.0s)]
*  There were no big surprises in Iowa last night as Donald Trump did cruise to victory. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=6.0s)]
*  51% of the total vote. Florida Governor Ron DeSantis came in a distant second, earning the support of 21% of Republican caucus goers, followed closely by Nikki Haley with 19%. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=10.0s)]
*  In fact, the ex-president won 98 out of 99 counties in Iowa, all without spending anywhere near as much time in the state as his rivals or even as much time as he spent in New York courtrooms. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=22.0s)]
*  Now, of course, the ex-president and his allies are selling this as an enormous victory. They want the story coming out of Iowa to be that Donald Trump has once again imposed his will over the Republican Party. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=33.0s)]
*  He's now cruising to the nomination. He will soon reclaim his throne in Washington. He's inevitable. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=44.0s)]
*  And it all may feel like a frightening inevitability. And there is, I will say, a lot to be scared about. I don't think I hold back on that score. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=50.0s)]
*  But I also think last night's results demonstrated that Donald Trump has some huge fundamental weaknesses that are just there staring us in the face. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=58.0s)]
*  Now, these were the coldest caucuses in Iowa history, which is saying something. People had to brave wind chills as low as negative 30 degrees. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=67.0s)]
*  They had to trudge through piles of snow and icy roads to get to their precincts. And it is fair to assume that only the most passionate amped up voters would venture out in that kind of weather. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=74.0s)]
*  And in the end, of that small group of people willing to do this, go out on a Monday night, barely a majority supported Donald Trump, the man who is supposed to be their unanimous beloved leader. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=85.0s)]
*  Just about half of all the Iowa caucus goers actually came out through the wind and the snow and the ice to support someone else. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=96.0s)]
*  And that lack of enthusiasm is also reflected in the turnout numbers. There were about 115,000 people that turned out last night compared to 186,000 back in 2016. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=106.0s)]
*  Now, some of that dip was likely due to the weather. But remember, caucuses always take place in the dead of winter. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=118.0s)]
*  Compare Trump's winning vote total to that of Senator Ted Cruz back in 2016. Trump won with just over 56,000 votes. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=125.0s)]
*  That's only about 4,500 more than Cruz eight years ago. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=133.0s)]
*  So this is the first snapshot we have of the 2024 election and doesn't fit with the narrative that we hear all the time that Republicans are just crazy for their cult leader Donald Trump across the board, right? [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=138.0s)]
*  I mean, think about this. There are more than 750,000 registered Republicans in the state of Iowa. 115,000 of them showed up to caucus last night. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=150.0s)]
*  Just 56,250 voted for the ex president. That's like less than 2% of the population by. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=159.0s)]
*  There were more people in the stands for the last Hawkeyes home game than the number that voted for Trump. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=167.0s)]
*  Then there's the entrance polling out of Iowa last night. A third of the people that showed up in that cold and wind, a third of caucus goers said that they would not consider Donald Trump to be fit for president if he is convicted of a crime. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=174.0s)]
*  I got to say that was probably the most interesting result from our entrance polling last night. That number is higher than I would have guessed by quite a bit. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=188.0s)]
*  And that's a big chunk of voters, and it really emphasizes the enormous risk to the Republican Party if they go ahead and nominate this guy who's been indicted 91 times. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=197.0s)]
*  He very well may be convicted of more than one crime before the election November. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=209.0s)]
*  And if that happens, I think it's fair to say even if all those people that said they would consider him unfit aren't going to vote against him, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=214.0s)]
*  It's going to be some smaller sliver, but there's going to be huge political consequences to a conviction. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=222.0s)]
*  The polling also reminds us that amid the repeated claims that the prosecutions of Trump are political, right? [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=227.0s)]
*  There is a very real difference between being indicted and being found guilty by a jury of your peers. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=234.0s)]
*  And then finally, I think we need to look at all this information from Iowa in the context of one more detail about the national electorate. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=242.0s)]
*  So according to the Biden campaign's internal research, this is fascinating. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=251.0s)]
*  The majority of undecided voters, those are people who don't know who they're going to vote for in the general, nearly three quarters of them do not believe that Donald Trump is going to be the Republican nominee. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=255.0s)]
*  Campaign officials say that is due in large part to the fact that these voters are just not paying attention. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=265.0s)]
*  Quote, you can't conceive of how tuned out these folks are. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=270.0s)]
*  Now, that might be hard to imagine if you are a regular viewer of this network. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=273.0s)]
*  MSNBC viewers hear a lot about the ex-president because we spend a lot of time discussing how he is a singular threat to American democracy. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=277.0s)]
*  But out in the broader world, Donald Trump is simply not front of mind. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=286.0s)]
*  He has not been in everyone's face all the time, as he was back in 2016 when he first ran for president. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=291.0s)]
*  He's not the number one story in every news outlet every day, commanding attention as he was during his years in the White House when he was the president. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=298.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is an exhausting and unpleasant person to think about. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=306.0s)]
*  So it's totally understandable and rational. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=310.0s)]
*  A whole lot of people have been trying not to think about him much over the past few years. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=313.0s)]
*  But very soon, that's going to become a lot more difficult. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=318.0s)]
*  Trump is about to once again become the center of mainstream public attention in a way that has not been the case since he tried to overthrow the government three years ago. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=322.0s)]
*  As McKay Coppens explains in a new piece for The Atlantic, for many Americans, the former president has become an abstraction. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=331.0s)]
*  But watching him speak, as Coppens did at a rally in Mason City, Iowa, early this month, is, quote, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=338.0s)]
*  Both instantly familiar and still somehow shocking, like rewatching an old movie you saw a hundred times as a kid, but whose most offensive jokes you'd forgotten. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=343.0s)]
*  To be re-exposed to Donald Trump is to be shocked anew at his sheer depravity and unfitness for any office. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=353.0s)]
*  And that is exactly what is about to happen to a lot of Americans who have not been reading the absolutely deranged things he says day in, day out, on True Social. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=360.0s)]
*  Or hearing the disgusting rhetoric he spews on stage at those very rallies. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=371.0s)]
*  And I can almost hear you groaning for your couch right now at the idea of having to see and hear him again like that day in, day out. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=375.0s)]
*  And I think there's a lot of people who think the more attention Donald Trump gets, the stronger he gets. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=382.0s)]
*  I don't think that's true. I think history shows that's not true. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=387.0s)]
*  The more attention he gets, the more people see him and hear him behaving abominably, the less they like him. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=390.0s)]
*  Just look at this today. What does he do after Iowa? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=398.0s)]
*  He shows up at the second defamation trial brought by the woman he had been found liable for sexually abusing, a woman who says he raped her in a dressing room. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=402.0s)]
*  The day after his win in Iowa, Trump could not help himself from going there to glower and attempt to intimidate this woman, who a jury found was telling the truth. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=412.0s)]
*  While a second jury now decides how much more money he must pay her for defaming her for calling her a liar when she says that he raped her. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=422.0s)]
*  So for all the braggadocio about Trump's victory last night, how we should all be very afraid, he has profound weaknesses and they are not going away. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=431.0s)]
*  The Iowa caucuses have this hold on the imagination of the nation's political reporting class because it's an open, frequently messy experiment democracy. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=441.0s)]
*  Not to mention for TV networks, you can actually point a camera at what's going on. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=449.0s)]
*  After the Democratic Party's debacle of 2020 where there were delays in the count, the top vote getter won fewer delegates, Democrats have just gotten rid of the whole thing. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=454.0s)]
*  They're just going to have normal mail-in voting, which honestly seems smart. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=462.0s)]
*  Not many people are up for joining the gaggle in this specific hour of the night, even when it isn't snowy and below freezing. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=466.0s)]
*  But the Republicans have kept their caucuses and there's a cheery civic informality to it all. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=474.0s)]
*  Even though it's not an official election run by the state, it's a party function. It's being run by the local Republican Party. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=480.0s)]
*  There's something downright Rockwellian about the scene. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=486.0s)]
*  You've got people trudging out in the snow and they all get in the room together and they talk and they argue and they consider the issues and the candidates. [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=490.0s)]
*  And then they caucus like this. [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=497.0s)]
*  This is the voting method. They are putting votes into a brown paper bag, passing it around, just stuff it in there, keep it moving. [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=499.0s)]
*  Don't like grocery bags? Maybe prefer popcorn buckets. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=508.0s)]
*  DeSantis. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=512.0s)]
*  Haley. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=515.0s)]
*  Trump. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=519.0s)]
*  That's it. [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=523.0s)]
*  If that's not enough transparency for you, try this gathering where they walk the aisles to grab ballots and stuff fistfuls of votes into clear ziplock bags. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=524.0s)]
*  Can't get more transparent than plastic bags. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=534.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, I don't personally have an issue with any of this. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=537.0s)]
*  I do not think people are going to abuse the grocery bags and the popcorn buckets in the system. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=539.0s)]
*  But our friend, Elie Mestal, makes an interesting observation. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=545.0s)]
*  He posts, this is what voting looks like when white people know only white people will be allowed to cast ballots. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=548.0s)]
*  Just grab them and count them. Just stuff them in. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=555.0s)]
*  There you go. Pass it on. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=558.0s)]
*  Watching this as the means of counting the votes and ballot security in the internal world of Republican politics is really mind blowing when you think for a second about the context here, right? [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=560.0s)]
*  I mean, two thirds of caucus goers believe that Joe Biden is not the legitimately elected president. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=572.0s)]
*  Four years of the big lie and the constant disgustingly racist drumbeat about Democrats stealing the election. [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=579.0s)]
*  Remember after the 2020 vote in Detroit when pro-Trump influencers passed around viral video of a wagon supposedly containing extra ballots being brought into the tabulation room? [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=586.0s)]
*  Who is actually a news photographer carting his equipment in? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=597.0s)]
*  But that didn't stop a white MAGA mob from pounding the glass and trying to force their way in and chanting, stop the count. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=601.0s)]
*  A scene like that was replicated in places like Milwaukee and Philadelphia and Atlanta, where Trump supporters launched personal attacks and threats against two black poll workers doing their civic duty. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=611.0s)]
*  Ruby Freeman and Shea Freeman-Morris and one other gentleman quite obviously surreptitiously passing around USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or cocaine. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=622.0s)]
*  What was your mom actually handing you on that video? [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=634.0s)]
*  A ginger mint. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=637.0s)]
*  Remember how Democrats and volunteers of color could not be trusted to collect and count votes, that they were stealing, that they were part of a conspiracy? [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=639.0s)]
*  Just keep that in mind as you watch this alternative universe in Iowa in which Republicans gather an incredibly homogenous population of folks and in this context, yeah, Beverly Fine passing a paper bag around to stuff it with votes. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=647.0s)]
*  Can you imagine what they would have done with that video if the bag were in the hands of Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss or poll workers in Detroit? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=662.0s)]
*  The point isn't about ballot security. It's not about the process that votes are counted. It's not about mail-in balloting. [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=672.0s)]
*  No. For Republicans, for Trump, to cry voting integrity is virtue signaling. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=678.0s)]
*  It signals who they think should control elections and which people they think are really worthy of representation. [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=683.0s)]
*  Donald Trump has made history in lots of ways, probably too many to count, but they include racking up an all-time record of impeachments and indictments for a president or ex-president. [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=692.0s)]
*  He has also, as far as I know, and at least in the modern era, come the closest of any president to being found guilty of sexual assault. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=701.0s)]
*  Last year, Trump was found liable for sexually abusing and defaming magazine writer E. Jean Carroll. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=709.0s)]
*  Now, it was litigated in a civil trial. She sued him, which is a lower standard of proof than a criminal proceeding, but still the jury deliberated on this. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=715.0s)]
*  They got evidence. They found him liable. And the details are horrific. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=723.0s)]
*  I think it has largely escaped penetrating the American consciousness because there's so much terrible stuff about him. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=727.0s)]
*  Carroll accused Trump of raping her in a dressing room in the Bergdorf-Gridman department store in Manhattan in the 1990s. [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=733.0s)]
*  He called her a liar. She sued him for defamation, and she won, with the jury awarding her $5 million in damages last May. [[00:12:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=741.0s)]
*  Today, the day after his win in the Iowa caucus, the frontrunner for the Republican nomination was in court for the start of a second defamation trial over other instances of his dismissing Carroll's accusations as false. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=749.0s)]
*  The jury will be asked only to determine damages because, as the judge said in court today, quote, [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=761.0s)]
*  it has been determined already that Mr. Trump did sexually assault Ms. Carroll, that he knew when he made the statements about Ms. Carroll, the statements are false, that he made them with reckless disregard. [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=766.0s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Ruhmann was inside that courtroom today, and she joins me now. It's so good to have you here. [[00:12:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=777.0s)]
*  Just thank you for having me. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=783.0s)]
*  So, first of all, do you have any sense of why he went to the trial today? I was a little surprised. [[00:13:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=784.0s)]
*  So I think there are two reasons that he went. One is a convergence of a legal and political strategy because Donald Trump seems to understand full well that his popularity rises in proportion to his playing the victim. [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=791.0s)]
*  And here, rather than allow E. Jean Carroll to rope herself in the victimhood that she has, in fact, earned, he instead decided he would play the victim so that when he goes back to New Hampshire, he can say, [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=802.0s)]
*  Oh, I was trapped in that courtroom all day. I had to be there when I would so much rather be here with you. [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=812.0s)]
*  But I think the other reason that he went was to make eye contact with as many of the people who are either decision makers or accusers here as possible. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=817.0s)]
*  And just like at his arraignment in Florida last year when he turned around, faced the gallery and stared down a gallery full of press, including me, today, those stairs were reserved for the prospective jurors. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=826.0s)]
*  And it included not only looking at them as they answered the judges questions, but also a lot of gesticulating. [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=838.0s)]
*  For example, when Judge Kaplan asked, Does anyone here believe President Trump has been treated unfairly by the justice system? [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=845.0s)]
*  Two prospective jurors stood up. But former President Trump also answered the question, even though it wasn't directed at him by going like this. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=852.0s)]
*  And he's trying to sort of manipulate the jury as much as he can. Now, the legal posture of this case, I had to go back and remind myself of it today. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=861.0s)]
*  So remind us, obviously, there was a trial. We covered that trial. You cover that trial. He was found liable in order to pay damages. [[00:14:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=869.0s)]
*  This is another trial. What is the origin of this? [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=877.0s)]
*  So the trial last spring was about statements that Trump had made in October of 2022 on the verge of a deposition in the case that's being tried right now. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=881.0s)]
*  After he was president. Correct. And because he was no longer president, there was less legal wrangling about his liability. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=890.0s)]
*  That case went to trial first. Consider this trial about the book ends of defamation. [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=896.0s)]
*  This is principally about two statements he made in June of 2019 when E. Jean Carroll first came forward and published an excerpt of her memoir in New York magazine. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=901.0s)]
*  But it's also from a punitive damages perspective about all the different times Trump has repeated those defamatory statements since, including as her lawyer Sean Crowley pointed out today, as many as 22 times just today in a truth storm as he was sitting in court. [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=909.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, he has been again. This is this sort of connects to what I was saying in the first. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=927.0s)]
*  I mean, the way that he has talked about her on truth social is so despicable, so disgusting, so beyond the pale. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=931.0s)]
*  I mean, just unrepentant. Right? Yes, right. Exactly. I mean, it's really yes. [[00:15:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=938.0s)]
*  And one of the things I think Sean did really effectively today in her opening was asked the jury not to consider a specific monetary number and punitive damages, but to think about how to make that award significant, very significant. [[00:15:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=942.0s)]
*  And she said, I want you to think about this. How much will it cost to make him stop and then paused and said, after all, this is a man who's a self professed billionaire. [[00:15:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=956.0s)]
*  So when we talk about the quantum of damages here, even though E. Jean's team is not talking about specific monetary amounts, I think what they are aiming for is something that really feels like a punch in the gut to former President Trump and causes him to think twice about continuing to do what he has done in the past. [[00:16:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=969.0s)]
*  Even as recently as this morning. Right. And what he has been found civilly liable for doing and is causing damage damage. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=986.0s)]
*  We should mention again over and above the sexual assault that he was found liable for by a civil jury. And this trial isn't about the sexual assault. [[00:16:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=993.0s)]
*  In fact, the jurors have to presume that that sexual assault happened, that it is true, that it was proven. [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1002.0s)]
*  There was so Trump's lawyer also made her case today or opening arguments. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1008.0s)]
*  What I read of it again, gross. I mean, I don't know. Anyway, it was gross. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1013.0s)]
*  There was an interesting exchange between her and Judge Kaplan that I thought of you because the last time you were sitting this table, we were talking about lessons from the civil trial in New York of judging Goran and how to deal with Trump lawyers and how to deal with Trump. [[00:17:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1020.0s)]
*  And one of the things you and I discussed was knows got to mean no. You can't let them to keep litigating thing. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1034.0s)]
*  And Kaplan said something in court today almost literally like it was. He had watched her segment when she tried to push on something. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1040.0s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, I'd like to take credit for Kaplan watching our segment where we talked about sort of the vending machine theory of parenting and how it applies to judging. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1048.0s)]
*  Right. You put a quarter in and you get something out. You're going to keep doing it. Right. Kaplan has always been that person. [[00:17:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1055.0s)]
*  And I think you could have a dozen former federal prosecutors from New York come on your show and tell you he has always been very tough on litigants. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1060.0s)]
*  And when he says no, he's always meant to know. The question was, was that the Lou Kaplan that was going to show up at this court, particularly with Donald Trump in front of him? [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1069.0s)]
*  And indeed today it was. And I hope it remains so. Yeah. He said, Ms. Saba, that when I say when I issue a ruling, it is the end of discussion, not the beginning of an argument, which I thought was a very clear rule. [[00:17:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1077.0s)]
*  And I think that's a very clear message about how he wants us to go. There's going to be another another day in court tomorrow, and we're expecting the former president to be there as well. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1090.0s)]
*  And E.G. Carol will be in that courtroom. That's right. And instead of staring at the back of her head, which was the only glimpse he got of her today, he's really hoping to stare down the barrel of the courtroom right into her eyes. [[00:18:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1099.0s)]
*  Something no person who's been victimized by Donald Trump should have to face truly despicable all around all of it. [[00:18:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1109.0s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:18:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fThwOsA3iqk&t=1117.0s)]
