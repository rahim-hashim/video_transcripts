# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: March 28
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA)
*  I'm directing my team to move heaven and earth to reopen the port and rebuild the bridge [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=0.0s)]
*  as soon as humanly possible. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=4.8s)]
*  We're going to work with our partners in Congress to make sure the state gets the support it [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=6.88s)]
*  needs. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=10.72s)]
*  It's my intention that federal government will pay for the entire cost of reconstructing [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=11.72s)]
*  that bridge, and I expect the Congress to support my effort. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=15.6s)]
*  Within hours of the Francis Scott Key Bridge collapsing after the cargo ship crash, President [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=21.26s)]
*  Joe Biden pledged the federal government would take the lead on rebuilding it. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=25.400000000000002s)]
*  The bridge is crucial not just for the state of Maryland or the port of Baltimore, but [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=29.6s)]
*  for the entire economy of the eastern seaboard. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=32.92s)]
*  The bridge collapse was a disaster, and one core role of the federal government is to [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=36.52s)]
*  backstop after disasters. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=40.760000000000005s)]
*  At least one Republican is already balking at the idea of using federal funds to rebuild [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=42.96s)]
*  this important piece of infrastructure. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=48.36s)]
*  Is Congress going to need to pony up more money, or is there enough money in the infrastructure [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=51.58s)]
*  package? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=55.88s)]
*  Great to be with you, Maria. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=57.440000000000005s)]
*  Yeah, it was kind of outrageous immediately for Biden to express in this tragedy the idea [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=59.24s)]
*  that he's going to use federal funds to pay for the entirety. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=66.16s)]
*  It's become standard for a certain type of Republican, unfortunately, like podcaster [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=69.64s)]
*  Ted Cruz, voting against emergency relief after Superstorm Sandy, only to come hat in [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=73.74000000000001s)]
*  hand to claim federal money for Texas after Hurricane Harvey even ran an ad about how [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=79.68s)]
*  much money he got. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=84.36s)]
*  And again, for the power grid disaster. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=85.96000000000001s)]
*  And in 2020, during the height of the COVID emergency, Donald Trump boasted about not [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=88.96000000000001s)]
*  providing the support to governors who didn't support him. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=93.24000000000001s)]
*  Now with this enormous disaster in Baltimore, we once again seeing the MAGA vision of governance [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=96.56s)]
*  in action, which is you only get government services if you support Donald Trump, and [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=101.04s)]
*  screw you if you don't. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=104.92s)]
*  Joining me now, Secretary of Transportation Pete Buttigieg. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=106.2s)]
*  Mr. Secretary, it's great to have you on the program. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=109.84s)]
*  First, just I wanted to get a kind of brief from you on where things stand in the aftermath [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=112.52s)]
*  of this disaster in terms of knowing what caused it and what the first next few steps [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=118.24s)]
*  look like. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=123.96s)]
*  Thanks. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=126.96s)]
*  Well, the NTSB is leading the investigation in partnership with the Coast Guard and a [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=127.96s)]
*  number of agencies that are involved. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=132.24s)]
*  They're going through the black box, looking at everything that could be relevant to understanding [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=134.2s)]
*  the causes. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=138.35999999999999s)]
*  They work independently from us by design, but we're doing everything we can to help [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=140.20000000000002s)]
*  in their effort. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=142.68s)]
*  In the meantime, our focus really is, as a department, is making sure we prepare for [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=143.84s)]
*  what's next. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=148.60000000000002s)]
*  That means getting that bridge rebuilt and dealing with all of the traffic disruptions [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=149.60000000000002s)]
*  until it is, getting the port reopened, and dealing with all of the supply chain disruptions [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=153.60000000000002s)]
*  until that happens. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=158.70000000000002s)]
*  Right now, there are three heavy lift vessels on their way to the site that should begin [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=160.72000000000003s)]
*  arriving tomorrow, and the last of them should be in place a couple of days after that. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=166.52s)]
*  To begin with that process of getting the wreckage cleared, you've got to understand [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=171.64s)]
*  that that passage that is blocked by the ship and the bridge there, that is the only channel [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=176.32s)]
*  in to most of the port of Baltimore, which is, of course, a very important port for the [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=182.32s)]
*  East Coast. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=186.72s)]
*  So that's why we've got to make sure that we get that cleared in a safe and responsible [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=187.72s)]
*  way so that the port can get back up and running. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=193.12s)]
*  And then there's the longer-term effort of making sure the bridge can get back up. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=195.92000000000002s)]
*  Just hours ago, we released the first $60 million of federal funding to help with that [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=198.92000000000002s)]
*  through our emergency relief program. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=204.12s)]
*  There's, I'm sure, going to be much more where that came from. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=205.84s)]
*  Everything it takes, as the president said, to help everyone in Baltimore get back to [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=209.32s)]
*  normal. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=212.8s)]
*  So clearing that ship, which is still in that channel, that's the channel that creates passage [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=213.8s)]
*  in and out of the port to get the port active again. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=218.32s)]
*  That's sort of priority number one right now. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=222.08s)]
*  The $60 million in quick-release emergency relief funds that got announced, I guess there's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=225.24s)]
*  a sort of pot of money for the immediate aftermath of disasters. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=231.04000000000002s)]
*  And then in terms of the actual transportation logistics here, I mean, it strikes me as an [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=235.28s)]
*  enormous problem to not have that bridge in terms of hazardous materials, in terms of [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=240.84s)]
*  flow from the port as well. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=245.52s)]
*  Do you have a game plan for how to deal with that? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=247.8s)]
*  Yeah, we've been working side by side with the Maryland DOT under the leadership of Governor [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=251.08s)]
*  Westmore as they have been putting together their plans to do the design and the procurement [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=257.48s)]
*  for the new bridge and everything it takes to get that port back up and running. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=262.48s)]
*  As you noted, this is an important thoroughfare. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=266.8s)]
*  About 30,000 vehicles a day counted on that bridge. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=268.52s)]
*  There are alternatives, 95 and 895, but those are both tunnels, which are not suitable for [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=271.54s)]
*  hazardous material transportation, at least most of the time, part of what makes this [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=277.62s)]
*  complicated in the meantime. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=282.54s)]
*  But these are some of the things that the funds can help with, and certainly in terms [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=283.94s)]
*  of clearing that channel. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=287.74s)]
*  These funds can go to demolition, debris removal. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=289.26s)]
*  They can go to supporting some of the costs associated with detours, as well as the early [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=292.98s)]
*  spending on that design and procurement of a new bridge. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=297.86s)]
*  And believe it or not, even though the original bridge took five years to construct, they [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=300.66s)]
*  have already had meetings and sessions beginning yesterday to launch the procurement and design [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=306.22s)]
*  process to get it back up. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=311.3s)]
*  Okay, so that was my next question. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=312.82000000000005s)]
*  I mean, just looking at that bridge, that looks like an expensive, difficult to build [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=314.22s)]
*  bridge. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=318.54s)]
*  I know nothing about bridges, but just my amateur eye, it's a long expanse. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=319.54s)]
*  It also has to be built so that ships can pass in and out underneath it. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=324.22s)]
*  This is a nontrivial undertaking. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=328.74s)]
*  What's the timeline and the cost like? [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=333.14000000000004s)]
*  And are you worried at all from the words we heard from the Republican congressman today [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=335.3s)]
*  that this House Republican majority is not going to be interested in providing the funding? [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=341.14s)]
*  This really needs to be a bipartisan priority, and anybody who views it as otherwise, I'm [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=349.09999999999997s)]
*  hoping they will reconsider because it could be your district that is the next one to be [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=354.3s)]
*  struck by tragedy. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=358.78s)]
*  And we always do better when America comes together. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=360.02s)]
*  Let me give you one example of a situation that happened in the past. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=362.9s)]
*  In 2007, many were killed and injured when I-35 bridge collapsed in Minnesota. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=366.65999999999997s)]
*  That was not because of a ship strike or a truck strike. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=374.21999999999997s)]
*  In that case, it wasn't going over the bay the way the bridge in Baltimore is. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=377.94s)]
*  But what it had in common was a sudden and catastrophic collapse. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=383.09999999999997s)]
*  In the end, about $260 million of federal funds were brought together, and that is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=387.26000000000005s)]
*  something that really passed very quickly and rather easily in that congress. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=393.42s)]
*  I would like to believe we can get that done now, too. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=397.5s)]
*  To be clear, things like the $60 million we put forward today, we've already got that [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=401.78000000000003s)]
*  funding because it was authorized in President Biden's bipartisan infrastructure plan that [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=405.5s)]
*  passed back in 2021. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=410.22s)]
*  But it's certainly the case that more funding might be needed. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=411.86s)]
*  Again, this really shouldn't be partisan in the least. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=414.86s)]
*  Just like the original bipartisan infrastructure law was bipartisan, we didn't have all Republicans [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=419.06s)]
*  with us, of course, but a number of Republicans crossed the aisle to work with President Biden, [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=424.7s)]
*  work with Democrats, and get that done because there's nothing partisan about a road or a bridge. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=428.9s)]
*  Secretary Pete Buttigieg, thank you so much for your time tonight. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=433.3s)]
*  Appreciate it, sir. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=436.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm joined now by Rachel Maddow, host of the Rachel Maddow Show, airing Mondays right here [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=438.06s)]
*  on MSNBC. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=442.1s)]
*  Rachel, I, of course, thought of you when I saw the Segretti shout out in the Eastman [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=443.34000000000003s)]
*  decision as a huge Watergate nerd and obsessive. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=448.3s)]
*  But the other thing that always makes me chuckle morbidly when I go back there is those people, [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=454.02000000000004s)]
*  a bunch of them went to prison. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=459.74s)]
*  They didn't just get disbarred. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=461.3s)]
*  There were also criminal consequences for a number of them. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=464.22s)]
*  Yeah, and I mean, and thank you for pointing that out and putting it right next to the [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=468.85999999999996s)]
*  way in which the Segretti case was name checked in the John Eastman disbarment recommendation. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=473.74s)]
*  As you pointed out, the way Segretti was brought up was, oh, and by the way, what John Eastman [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=479.97999999999996s)]
*  did is way worse than what Donald Segretti did. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=484.86s)]
*  And Donald Segretti, of course, went to prison. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=488.5s)]
*  I mean, John Eastman may yet go to prison. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=491.21999999999997s)]
*  I mean, it is to see Trump lawyers here. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=493.26000000000005s)]
*  We've got Giuliani with his license suspended. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=495.86s)]
*  I still don't really understand what happened to the criminal or the federal investigation [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=498.86s)]
*  of Rudy Giuliani and how that exactly went away. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=503.5s)]
*  There's still unanswered questions there. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=506.90000000000003s)]
*  He's not currently a defendant anywhere. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=509.1s)]
*  He is facing a ruinous defamation judgment and his law license is suspended. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=510.78000000000003s)]
*  We've got Eastman now with the recommendation that he be disbarred. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=515.94s)]
*  He's barred from practicing life suspended right now. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=518.86s)]
*  Ken Chesbrough, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis have all pled guilty. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=522.82s)]
*  We've got, you know, I mean, all of them, right? [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=528.7s)]
*  Stephanie Lambert in Michigan just got arrested last week. [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=531.6600000000001s)]
*  The there's one of the takeaways from this is that the bar associations are holding up [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  as an American institution. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=543.3000000000001s)]
*  And who would have picked them as the institution that was going to be really important here? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=545.1400000000001s)]
*  But they tried to construct a sort of legal tissue around this coup effort, this violent [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=549.0999999999999s)]
*  coup effort to take over the government. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=554.9799999999999s)]
*  And the lawyers thus far have really been the only ones that have paid. [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=556.8599999999999s)]
*  It's been the rioters and the lawyers. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=560.6199999999999s)]
*  And the reason the lawyers have paid is because the bar associations have stood up as an [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=562.0999999999999s)]
*  institution and said, we're going to do our part here. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=565.8599999999999s)]
*  That's such an important point, because part of what was so insidious about the coup attempt, [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=568.6999999999999s)]
*  particularly as channeled through Chesbrough and Eastman and sort of less so Powell, honestly, [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=572.54s)]
*  who is sort of doing PR more than actual law, was that it was it was there were what they [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=578.14s)]
*  said were colorable legal claims. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=586.02s)]
*  Jeffrey Clark as well, right? [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=587.86s)]
*  That like they were trying to cloak all of this in the language, not of open insurrection [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=589.02s)]
*  against the United States of America, not an attempt to topple democracy, which is what [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=593.78s)]
*  they were trying to do, but in a bunch of sort of procedural mechanics about how the [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=598.34s)]
*  electoral count act works and all this. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=601.8199999999999s)]
*  And so in that respect, it does strike me as very important. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=603.54s)]
*  The bar association, the Guild of Lawyers, is actually saying these arguments aren't [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=605.5s)]
*  just like arguments of the margin that are sort of interesting. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=609.94s)]
*  They're actually not doing law. [[00:10:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=612.86s)]
*  They're doing something else that violates the kind of ethical duty you have as a lawyer. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=614.26s)]
*  Yes. And I mean, people who study the way that democracies turn into authoritarian systems [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=621.38s)]
*  of government talk about civil society and talk about professional associations and talk [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=630.54s)]
*  about the different types of institutions that we have as a country that you don't [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=636.5s)]
*  necessarily think of as being close to like the electoral process and the other things [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=640.38s)]
*  that we think of as politics. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=644.22s)]
*  But they end up having a really important role in policing essentially what you're [[00:10:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=645.9s)]
*  allowed to do and stay in good standing. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=651.46s)]
*  So like when we've talked about or when I've been obsessed with the American fascists [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=654.46s)]
*  and would be fascist leaders in the 1930s, the Catholic Church ended up being really, [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=660.62s)]
*  really important. [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=665.74s)]
*  You know, they did a lot of bad things in the lead up to World War Two and during World [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=666.86s)]
*  War Two. But they also took Charles Coughlin off the air when Coughlin was organizing his [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=669.8199999999999s)]
*  listeners in America into paramilitary cells and telling them to prepare for violent [[00:11:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=674.9399999999999s)]
*  revolution against the U.S. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=680.26s)]
*  government. It was the church that came in and took him off took him off the air with [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=681.3s)]
*  George Van Horn mostly who was born storming the country saying he was going to be the [[00:11:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=685.06s)]
*  American Führer. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=688.74s)]
*  He'd been deputy chief of staff of the U.S. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=689.9s)]
*  Army. The U.S. [[00:11:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=691.86s)]
*  Army came in and said, we're going to take your pension if you keep talking about if [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=693.14s)]
*  you keep talking about being America's Führer. [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=697.26s)]
*  And he decided he'd keep the money and and and ditch the ditch the dictatorship. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=699.38s)]
*  Institutions of all different kinds are called upon in different ways to do this. [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=705.9s)]
*  And the Bar Association, there's been a concerted effort within the legal profession to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=710.82s)]
*  say not in our name and not with our skills and not with our profession. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=714.62s)]
*  We self-regulate as a profession and we're not going to do this. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=719.2600000000001s)]
*  So there's another aspect to this, too. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=722.38s)]
*  There's the institutional aspect and civil society sort of holding up in the Bar [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=723.7800000000001s)]
*  Association, which is really important to me. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=727.3000000000001s)]
*  But but last night we talked about Carrie Lake and the fact that she's basically waived [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=729.0600000000001s)]
*  the white flag on the definition suit filed against her for the lie she told about her [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=732.6600000000001s)]
*  own loss in twenty twenty two, a kind of like, you know, big lie to like her own sort [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=736.9s)]
*  of knockoff sequel that was as ridiculous and luckily not as violent. [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=744.66s)]
*  What strikes me is important. [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=748.8199999999999s)]
*  I want to say this because I think people think like, oh, the libs want Donald Trump to be [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=750.14s)]
*  tried for this sort of retribution. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=753.5799999999999s)]
*  Or I honestly the thing that most important to me is like the epistemic aspect, which is [[00:12:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=755.66s)]
*  we don't in this country have a lot of mechanisms to focus people on establishing consensus [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=761.78s)]
*  facts. And I think the January 6th committee did that to some point, but it was it was [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=768.62s)]
*  tarnished in lots of ways. And what's striking is whether it's in the defamation cases, the [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=773.1800000000001s)]
*  many we've seen or in these other adjudicative processes like bar, you know, bar state bars, [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=776.9s)]
*  when you get into that realm, there is nothing there. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=783.62s)]
*  The facts are plain as day. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=787.78s)]
*  The intentions are plain as day. [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=789.66s)]
*  And to fix that for the American people, that's why I feel it's so important, not even about [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=791.38s)]
*  retribution or justice or accountability. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=795.6999999999999s)]
*  It's actually just establishing what happened. [[00:13:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=798.02s)]
*  Yes. And and part of it, I mean, because, you know, part of me is forever eight years old [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=801.18s)]
*  and constantly needs to be entertained. [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=807.62s)]
*  Part of it is just the hilarity of it. [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=809.9399999999999s)]
*  Right. In the Jeff Clark disbarment trial, one of the things that we learned from a senior [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=811.74s)]
*  Justice Department official just testified in that trial is that Jeff Clark's belief [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=817.1s)]
*  about what was going on with the election was tied to his fantasy that smart thermostats [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=821.82s)]
*  had stolen the election. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=826.58s)]
*  Like, OK, I want to I want to know more about that. [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=827.78s)]
*  Like, please give me all of that. [[00:13:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=830.9s)]
*  I want to hear. But the more the more serious point is that you're exactly right, Chris. [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=832.5400000000001s)]
*  I mean, the the the criminal justice system for all its faults, it makes evidence public. [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=836.74s)]
*  Right. It tests evidence. [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=842.0200000000001s)]
*  It tests facts. [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=844.0600000000001s)]
*  It's an adversarial, fair process. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=845.6600000000001s)]
*  And when you lie, your lie is exposed and then that is inadmissible or it is punished. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=848.62s)]
*  And pouting doesn't count and yelling doesn't count and threats are illegal. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=853.94s)]
*  And it's a compulsory process. [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=858.0600000000001s)]
*  And the truth gets proven. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=859.86s)]
*  And it's done in a fair way that everybody can see. [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=862.0600000000001s)]
*  You get to put your best foot forward. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=864.94s)]
*  You get to make your best case with joke lawyers or with real lawyers if you can afford them. [[00:14:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=867.3s)]
*  And that process is something that can prove reality. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=872.38s)]
*  It can bring Earth one and Earth two crashing together in a way that really makes all the myth [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=878.18s)]
*  lose its power. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=884.02s)]
*  And it doesn't make it disappear, but it exposes it in a way that is unimpeachable. [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=885.0999999999999s)]
*  And we've seen we've seen small versions of that time and time and time again in all these [[00:14:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=889.4599999999999s)]
*  different areas. But but not the big one yet. [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6DoyEJLZdGA&t=894.26s)]
