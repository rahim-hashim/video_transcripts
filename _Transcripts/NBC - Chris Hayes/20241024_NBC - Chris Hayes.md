# Stacey Abrams on who will win her home state of Georgia
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 24, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk)
*  The crucial state of Georgia, of course, which Joe Biden won in 2020 in a sort of shocking turn [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=0.0s)]
*  of events, the site of some of the most contested, hard-fought and fascinating elections of our time, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=5.92s)]
*  Stacey Abrams. She knows. She knows all about it. She's been working to get out the vote all [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=11.200000000000001s)]
*  across Georgia, not just in the election for a while. She's, of course, the founder of the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=17.2s)]
*  new Georgia product project and the founder of the voter mobilization initiative, Fair Fight Action. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=21.04s)]
*  She's the host of Crooked Media's Assembly Required podcast, and she joins me now. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=26.24s)]
*  Good to have you on, Stacey. Thank you for having me. How are things looking in Georgia to you, [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=31.599999999999998s)]
*  someone who, I don't know if there's a person in America who knows the politics of that state any [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=37.68s)]
*  better? Well, we're very excited about where we are. As of today, a third of Georgia's voters [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=42.879999999999995s)]
*  have cast their ballots, and we know that right now it's neck and neck, which means we have to [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=49.84s)]
*  keep showing up. We've got to keep voting. But we also have to remember to reach out to our friends [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=55.76s)]
*  and our families who aren't sure if, not between voting for Vice President Harris and former [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=60.239999999999995s)]
*  President Trump, but whether they should vote or not. And this speech, this moment, is the reminder [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=67.36s)]
*  of why the affirmative of voting is so important, because it's not simply about who you like. It's [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=72.32s)]
*  about what they will do for you. And what Kamala Harris laid out means so much in the state of [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=77.68s)]
*  Georgia, a state where we have the sandwich generation taking care of kids and of parents, [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=82.56s)]
*  where we do not have Medicaid expansion, and so health care costs are so high, a state where we [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=87.60000000000001s)]
*  lost Amber Thurman and Candy Miller because of the arcane, horrific, and mean-spirited abortion ban [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=94.16s)]
*  that is killing women across this country, including right here in Georgia. And so this [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=101.76s)]
*  is no longer a hypothetical. This is not a contrast between two narrowly divided issues. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=105.84s)]
*  This is a stark decision between someone who wants us to move forward and someone who only [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=111.36s)]
*  wants to exact revenge. Donald Trump does not care about Georgia. Kamala Harris does. And we [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=116.16s)]
*  need to get out and vote. And we believe we can get it done. As Vice President speaking, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=120.8s)]
*  Amber Thurman's name today on stage, paying tribute to her, a woman who passed away after [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=124.8s)]
*  seeking reproductive care denied to her by the state's legal apparatus. In terms of the [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=131.04s)]
*  early vote, let's just take a look here. And I don't want to get too into, like, the weeds here. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=136.8s)]
*  But in 2020, you know, a huge percentage of voters voted early. You know, the vast bulk [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=140.16s)]
*  of Georgia voters voted early. Of course, that was in the midst of the pandemic. And this is what we [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=148.24s)]
*  have as of now in terms of, I guess, is this today's data? So enormous levels of voting happening. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=152.8s)]
*  Those numbers, right? Those numbers be right. Walk us through what's happening and the difference [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=166.64000000000001s)]
*  between now and 2020. So in Georgia, we have roughly seven and a half million registered voters, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=171.68s)]
*  depending on the numbers you look at. In 2020, we had roughly five and a half, five, five and a, [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=178.24s)]
*  you know, five point two million people who actually voted. And so what you're looking at [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=184.8s)]
*  is one of the highest levels of early voting. And it's for two reasons. One is that despite [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=189.68s)]
*  SB 202 and Brian Kemp and Brad Ratzensberger attempt to limit access to voting by making it [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=195.12s)]
*  harder to vote by mail, those voters who were told it's harder now to vote by mail did not give up [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=201.76s)]
*  as they were hoping. They instead have shifted to show up in person. And luckily in Georgia, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=207.20000000000002s)]
*  we have both in-person early voting and vote by mail. But let's not get confused. This is not [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=211.92000000000002s)]
*  because they've made it easier. It's because people refuse to let them take away the right to vote. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=216.48000000000002s)]
*  In addition, what we are seeing though, are Republicans who used to vote on election day [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=221.20000000000002s)]
*  because Republicans finally realized that if you tell everyone to wait, they may believe you. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=225.04s)]
*  And so Republicans have made a concerted effort to shift voters into early voting. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=229.28s)]
*  Our mission then is to make certain that we outnumber them at the polls, that we not succumb to [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=234.24s)]
*  their attempts to block us. Luckily, the Georgia Supreme Court has said that they will not suborn [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=239.84s)]
*  the new terrible chaos-laden rules that the state election board that Republicans try to put in [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=245.44000000000003s)]
*  place. And we have to think about this every day, that we have the chance to once again [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=252.08s)]
*  be the state that delivers 16 electoral college votes to Kamala Harris and to a future that we [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=256.96000000000004s)]
*  all deserve. Yeah, that was a useful explanation of what's going on with the early voting. One [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=262.48s)]
*  of the things is making any kind of analysis of these early votes, apples to apples, impossible, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=268.24s)]
*  those two things. You had the pandemic in 2020, which totally changed the landscape. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=273.76s)]
*  And now you had this weird polarization happening around voting method driven by Donald Trump's [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=278.0s)]
*  delusional fantasies and lies. And now you have more and more people voting early, not in some [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=283.6s)]
*  ideologically sorted way, which of course never made any sense to begin with. I want to end on [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=289.44s)]
*  that question you were saying before. There's been so much attention, I would say, the last two or [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=296.24s)]
*  weeks of the last undecided voters. People were still making up their mind. And I think you're [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=300.56s)]
*  probably right that that category has diminished to a point where it's not that statistically [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=305.92s)]
*  significant. And probably a larger bucket of voters are voters that would vote, but maybe [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=310.88s)]
*  something else is going to come up. What do you think is the most important thing [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=316.15999999999997s)]
*  for turning folks that might vote, but may not, into absolute sure vote? [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=319.68s)]
*  So on our podcast this week on assembly required, we had Kavitha Sarana, who wrote the story of Amber [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=324.16s)]
*  Thurman for ProPublica. And she pointed out that this election is not just about, it is absolutely [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=332.48s)]
*  about Kamala Harris, but it's also about the judges. It's about the DAs. It's about who is [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=338.8s)]
*  interpreting these horrific laws and who can change the rules. The title that we've given this [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=343.92s)]
*  episode is Voting Can Save Women's Lives. And that, I think, is one of the most salient moments [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=350.16s)]
*  in her speech and in the decision-making of voters across Georgia and across the country. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=356.08000000000004s)]
*  Do you want to save the lives of half of our population? Do you want women to be first-class [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=360.96000000000004s)]
*  citizens again in Georgia and around the country? Do you want to be able to take care of your family? [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=366.8s)]
*  And do you want the ability to choose what that family looks like? Those are the questions on [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=372.08000000000004s)]
*  people's minds. And that's the question that we're asking every Georgian to take into consideration [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=377.2s)]
*  and show up at the polls. The last day of early voting is November 1st. Election day is November [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=381.68s)]
*  5th. And between now and then go to iwillvote.com to find out where you can vote, how you can vote, [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=386.32s)]
*  and please, by God, go vote. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1zQUzZcf1nk&t=391.52s)]
