Video Description: LaDoris Cordell, retired California Superior Court judge: “When you’re a female judge—and also a judge of color, this combination is such that we have to make sure we are in control of the proceedings. I encourage the judge if she has to do so, and maybe she’s already done it, to have ‘The Talk’ early on.”

# Ex-judge: Trump election trial judge should have ‘The Talk’ with lawyers
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w)
*  The Doris Cordell served 19 years as a judge, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=0.0s)]
*  including over a dozen on the Superior Court of California, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=2.8000000000000003s)]
*  author of Her Honor, My Life on the Bench, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=5.44s)]
*  What Works, What's Broken, How to Change It. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=7.5s)]
*  Harry Littman served as [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=9.44s)]
*  Deputy Assistant Attorney General at [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=10.88s)]
*  the US Department of Justice, is now a Legal Affairs [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=12.4s)]
*  columnist, Los Angeles Times, and both join me now. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=14.5s)]
*  Judge Cordell, let me start with you because I'm [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=17.56s)]
*  particularly interested in how you think of this as a judge. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=19.16s)]
*  I mean, there is a lot of [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=21.96s)]
*  discretion given to judges over the timing of these things. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=23.580000000000002s)]
*  You have a very unusual case here for a number of reasons, [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=27.08s)]
*  not just the ex-president who's been indicted, [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=30.799999999999997s)]
*  but the campaign calendar. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=33.32s)]
*  How do you think is a fair way to evaluate a schedule, [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=35.599999999999994s)]
*  and how would you be approaching it were you this judge? [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=39.2s)]
*  No trial judge with any experience who has assigned a case [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=43.44s)]
*  this gathering this much attention, [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=49.28s)]
*  such a high profile trial, [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=52.26s)]
*  would ever do anything in a haphazard manner. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=54.559999999999995s)]
*  So when Judge Chutkin came forward and said the trial date is March the 4th, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=57.76s)]
*  you better believe that she gave it a lot of thought. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=63.04s)]
*  She has experience as a public defender, [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=66.92s)]
*  so she understands what defense attorneys have to deal with [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=69.64s)]
*  in terms of going through documents. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=72.56s)]
*  But be sure, she gave a lot of deliberation to this, [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=74.56s)]
*  and I bet you she consulted, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=79.52s)]
*  she may have consulted with other judges on the bench [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=81.28s)]
*  to kind of put together what is the fairest way for both sides, [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=84.04s)]
*  understanding full well that the defense is entitled to do process, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=88.32s)]
*  the time to put the case together. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=92.28s)]
*  So when she came out with this, it wasn't like, [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=94.28s)]
*  oh, come out on the bench, and oh, I'll just have a compromise date [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=96.56s)]
*  between what each side wants. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=99.76s)]
*  That did not happen. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=101.48s)]
*  Trust me, she put in a lot of thought in coming up with this trial date, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=103.0s)]
*  and it's a date that's firm. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=107.4s)]
*  Now, will it change? It could. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=108.72s)]
*  Someone could get sick, the judge, things can happen. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=110.4s)]
*  But if the date is changed, it isn't going to be changed to two years out. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=113.28s)]
*  Yeah, she said this during those arguments. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=117.16s)]
*  She said this to John Loro, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=121.67999999999999s)]
*  I will say you and I have a very, very different estimate [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=122.56s)]
*  of the time that's needed to prepare for this case, [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=125.0s)]
*  when Mr. Trump will be treated exactly with no more or less deference [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=127.19999999999999s)]
*  than any other defendant would be. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=130.04s)]
*  Loro, at one point, and, Harry, I'd love to get your response to this, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=132.48s)]
*  seems to be sort of flagging an issue for appeal, right, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=135.84s)]
*  already in this hearing. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=138.84s)]
*  He says, we will not be able to provide adequate representation [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=140.72s)]
*  to a client who has been charged with serious offences [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=143.48000000000002s)]
*  as a result of that trial date. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=145.48000000000002s)]
*  The trial date will deny President Trump the opportunity [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=146.76000000000002s)]
*  to have effective assistance of counsel in light of the enormous case. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=149.88s)]
*  Of course, effective assistance of counsel is something that you can use [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=153.32s)]
*  for a post-conviction appeal. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=156.08s)]
*  What do you think about him using that language in that context, Harry? [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=158.16s)]
*  Yeah, there's no doubt about it, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=163.8s)]
*  and he was already in a bit of a hole with her in this hearing. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=164.96s)]
*  She said twice, turned down the temperature, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=168.92s)]
*  and he had proffered that outlandish proposal to go two years out. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=171.6s)]
*  So he is, without doubt, saying, [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=176.51999999999998s)]
*  you are violating the Constitution, Your Honor. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=178.76s)]
*  And, of course, we will comply, but you're violating the Constitution, [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=181.44s)]
*  and we're going to bring this to the Court of Appeals. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=185.16s)]
*  All of those things. I really want to second one thing [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=187.88s)]
*  that Judge Cordell just said. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=190.28s)]
*  Remember the very first day, how there were several judges of that court [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=192.28s)]
*  who showed up, including the chief judge. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=196.84s)]
*  I think it's quite clear that the whole court here, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=199.04000000000002s)]
*  each of which has dealt with hundreds of cases under, [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=202.0s)]
*  and has been including appeals, is really cohesive [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=204.96s)]
*  and thinking together of this as a kind of test of the court, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=209.96s)]
*  and she absolutely can rely on her colleagues [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=213.56s)]
*  to reach a considered decision of what will hold up [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=216.56s)]
*  against a Court of Appeals. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=220.52s)]
*  The final thing is to say that while she did note the Speedy Trial interest, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=222.08s)]
*  it's clear she led, again, as the judge has just indicated, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=226.72s)]
*  with the due process rights of the defendant. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=230.52s)]
*  She's not going to get in the trap of suggesting that they are pushed back [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=233.76000000000002s)]
*  and be behind, below the due process line because of the need for speed. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=239.0s)]
*  That comes first, and that's just what she said. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=243.92000000000002s)]
*  So, Judge, you said, you know, so I've been talking to lawyers, right, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=246.36s)]
*  and one of the things that is notable, right, is things get delayed all the time. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=250.28s)]
*  I mean, this stuff can move very slowly, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=254.0s)]
*  And it can be any number of reasons, right? [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=256.6s)]
*  One of the lawyers had heart surgery, or, you know, I mean, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=258.52s)]
*  there's a whole bunch of things that can happen, right? [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=261.12s)]
*  What's clear here, what's evident to everyone, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=264.04s)]
*  and I think Judge Chutkin has been very clear about this, [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=267.08s)]
*  is there's a strong public interest in a swift trial. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=269.2s)]
*  Donald Trump and his lawyers don't want a swift trial, right? [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=274.44s)]
*  So the question now is, like, what can they do to throw sand in the gears? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=277.2s)]
*  What would you be anticipating if you were that judge? [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=281.08s)]
*  Sure. When a judge presides over pretrial motions, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=285.56s)]
*  it's the opportunity for the trial judge to size up who the parties are. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=289.56s)]
*  How are they going to behave? Who's going to engage in theatrics? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=293.35999999999996s)]
*  Who's going to be rude or maybe not want to follow the orders? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=296.24s)]
*  And what I did on the bench when I had a high-profile case [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=299.52s)]
*  and I knew that there were some issues, I, and I, this is what I do. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=304.03999999999996s)]
*  You have the talk. It's the judicial talk. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=308.4s)]
*  And the talk is very simple. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=312.47999999999996s)]
*  You look the litigants and the lawyers, all of them dead in the eye, [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=314.12s)]
*  and you say to them, and this is what I did when I presided over cases, [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=318.12s)]
*  I am going to give you the fairest trial you have ever had. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=322.24s)]
*  And you are going to give me your respect [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=327.03999999999996s)]
*  and you're going to follow my orders. Are we clear? [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=330.47999999999996s)]
*  And generally, I would hear from both sides, [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=333.68s)]
*  yes, Your Honor, then we would move on. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=335.44s)]
*  So it may be soon that Judge Chutkin, when these attorneys start again [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=338.16s)]
*  about maybe the trial date, to have the talk, the judicial talk. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=344.36s)]
*  It certainly worked for me and I'm not the only person, [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=349.24s)]
*  the only judge who has done this, especially when you're a female judge, [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=352.32s)]
*  because sometimes we don't get the respect we should be getting [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=356.48s)]
*  as opposed to a male judge and also being a judge of color. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=359.88s)]
*  So this combination is such that we have to make sure [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=363.72s)]
*  we are in control of the proceedings. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=367.40000000000003s)]
*  So I encourage the judge, if she has to do so, [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=368.84000000000003s)]
*  and maybe she's already done it, to have the talk early on. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=371.68s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, that seems, I mean, she has, by all accounts, [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=376.68s)]
*  and I have not been in that courtroom, seemed to really control the space [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=380.56s)]
*  authoritatively, obviously, as a judge who is both respected [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=384.24s)]
*  and has some real experience. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=386.8s)]
*  This is, you know, Judge Eileen Cannon down in Florida [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=388.56s)]
*  is going to be providing over her third criminal trial or something like that. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=391.12s)]
*  So this is a totally different universe. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=394.04s)]
*  I guess when I keep coming back to Harry and you said this and, [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=396.12s)]
*  you know, other folks have said this, I've been, you know, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=400.96s)]
*  watching coverage about this, like, this is pretty hard. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=403.12s)]
*  It's pretty set in stone. It might slip for small logistical reasons. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  What are they going to try to do to make that not be the case? [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=409.56s)]
*  There are two kinds of delays, Chris. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=415.24s)]
*  One would be the week at a time someone's, you know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=416.92s)]
*  I just had an emergency surgery or this very motion, [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=421.28000000000003s)]
*  or we want an evidentiary hearing. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=424.8s)]
*  And I think this March date builds in some of that a month, two months. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=426.76s)]
*  And still the nation's very strong interest in having a verdict [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=431.6s)]
*  before election is served. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=436.08s)]
*  The big way of eating up time is an appeal. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=437.48s)]
*  And that, for example, I think will be happening in Fulton County, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=441.72s)]
*  where removal motions and you and you can bet that Trump will bring it [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=445.88s)]
*  at the last minute are appealable. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=449.64s)]
*  But the different actions to challenge the whole case here [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=452.04s)]
*  that Loro has telegraphed, that it's pretextual, [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=456.12s)]
*  that it's reprisal for Hunter Biden, that Trump has immunity, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=460.04s)]
*  none of them at least has automatic right of appeal. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=464.24s)]
*  It will be up to Chutkin. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=468.88s)]
*  So assuming she's a strong gatekeeper here, [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=470.52000000000004s)]
*  then I think they have to go in little bite size chunks [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=473.88s)]
*  and that can't get them far enough. [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=476.92s)]
*  So the big issue is, can they get an interlocutory appeal [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=479.08000000000004s)]
*  to the Court of Appeals even then, by the way, the Court of Appeals, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=482.28000000000003s)]
*  I think, is prime for Trump's delaying tactics. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=485.28000000000003s)]
*  But absent that, there just is no I don't think they're going to be able [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=488.76000000000005s)]
*  to really eat up a lot of time. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=492.24s)]
*  Yeah, get an interlocutory appeal with an appeal by right. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=494.04s)]
*  Free, free trial, right? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=498.08000000000004s)]
*  Like, can they find something that gets them there? [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=499.76s)]
*  Scressionary interlocutory appeals, if Chutkin agrees. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=503.36s)]
*  Interesting. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=507.48s)]
*  And yeah. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=508.28s)]
*  All right, Ladoris, Cordell and Harry Lippman, thank you both. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=509.4s)]
*  Appreciate it. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qyisrm9JY8w&t=512.28s)]
