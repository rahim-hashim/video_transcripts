# Hayes: Supreme Court has ruled against the right’s ‘slow-motion insurrection’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 27, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It is not often the case these days, but today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=0.0s)]
*  the Supreme Court issued a long anticipated monumental ruling that actually bolsters [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=5.04s)]
*  America's democratic strength. Now, the case before the court today contained at its core [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=10.64s)]
*  an idea that was central to the Donald Trump scheme to overturn the 2020 elections. The [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=16.32s)]
*  question of whether state legislatures can do whatever they want in elections up to and include [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=22.400000000000002s)]
*  a simply appointing electors to their preferred candidate, even when the citizens of their state [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=27.68s)]
*  vote the other way. Trump's lawyers pushed the idea that Republican legislators in all kinds of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  states could simply ignore the will of the people in states that voted for Joe Biden and opt instead [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=39.44s)]
*  to send their own fake electors, Trump electors, to Congress. It was fake electors in seven swing [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=45.92s)]
*  states, Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, New Mexico, and Nevada, that in coordination with [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=52.32s)]
*  the Trump campaign sought to overthrow the election results. Trump and his lawyer, John Eastman, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=57.52s)]
*  along with others, actively lobbied for and pushed this idea across multiple states, [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=63.36s)]
*  trying in fact to get state legislatures to abandon their core democratic duty and choose [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=68.08s)]
*  instead a path to essentially crown Trump king. Here's the former speaker of the Arizona House, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=73.92s)]
*  Republican conservative Rusty Bowers, describing a 2020 call he got from Trump coup lawyer, John [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=81.04s)]
*  Eastman. And what did Dr. Eastman want you to do? That we would in fact vote, take a vote to [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=88.0s)]
*  overthrow, or I shouldn't say overthrow, that we would decertify the electors and that that because [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  we had plenary authority to do so. I said, what would you have me do? And he said, just do it and [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=108.96s)]
*  let the court sort it out. Plenary authority, absolute, total authority. The state legislators [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=117.67999999999999s)]
*  have total authority over who wins an election. We now have new reporting from the Washington [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=123.67999999999999s)]
*  Post that special counsel Jack Smith has taken a keen interest in the fake electors plot, focusing [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=129.28s)]
*  specifically on potential fraud. New York Times recently reported that one of the Trump campaign's [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=135.12s)]
*  key players in the scheme may actually be cooperating with federal prosecutors. And [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=141.12s)]
*  tomorrow, Republican Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who Trump infamously called [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=146.32s)]
*  and told to find roughly 11,000 votes to overturn the Georgia results, will meet with federal [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=151.6s)]
*  prosecutors for, as far as we know, the first time on the special counsel's team in Atlanta. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=157.44s)]
*  We're gonna have more on the special counsel's investigation and the rapid developments coming [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=162.72s)]
*  up. But again, at the core of Trump's attempted coup, and there's a bunch of things going on, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=166.48s)]
*  but at its core, as articulated by John Eastman as he told Rusty Bowers, is this bizarre, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=172.0s)]
*  to my mind, facially ludicrous fringe idea that conservatives ran with after their scheme failed [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=178.56s)]
*  to return Trump to the White House. It's called the independent state legislature theory, although [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=184.56s)]
*  calling it a theory gives it a little too much credit. And it would give state legislatures [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=189.36s)]
*  plenarily, virtually unchecked power over federal elections. It was an idea infamously pushed by [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=194.48000000000002s)]
*  coup memo author John Eastman and his allies in Congress. Basically says state legislatures [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=201.52s)]
*  are the ultimate arbiters of how elections are run in a state, no matter what state law or state [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=206.56s)]
*  officials or crucially state courts say. All we are demanding of Vice President Pence is this [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=212.0s)]
*  afternoon at one o'clock. He let the legislatures of the state look into this so we get to the [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=221.44s)]
*  bottom of it and the American people know whether we have control of the direction of our government [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=228.08s)]
*  or not. This is bigger than President Trump. It is the very essence of our Republican form of [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=233.04s)]
*  government and it has to be done. And anybody that is not willing to stand up to do it does [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=241.6s)]
*  not deserve to be in the office. It is that simple. That was the speech at the ellipse right before [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=246.79999999999998s)]
*  an angry mob went to the Capitol and bashed a bunch of cops' brains in. The insurrection on January [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=253.28s)]
*  6th failed in its goal to subvert democracy. It failed to keep Donald Trump in office for a second [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=260.32s)]
*  term. But in many ways the spirit of the coup of Donald Trump's multi-pronged plan to overturn [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=265.6s)]
*  the election results continued and continues. We have seen in state after state like Arizona, [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=271.52000000000004s)]
*  Georgia and Texas, Republicans stripping power from state elections officials and candidates [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=276.32000000000005s)]
*  vowing to abolish bipartisan election commissions in states like Wisconsin. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=282.88s)]
*  This time it was not a violent mob but politicians, locally elected officials at the state level, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=288.40000000000003s)]
*  trying to carry out a version of Eastman's vision, right, to take power back from any [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=293.12s)]
*  official that has it delegated and give it all to the state legislatures so that they can run [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=299.6s)]
*  elections entirely. Not coincidentally, those are also the places where Republicans have a lot of [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=304.88s)]
*  control. And they've been doing it right in front of all of us. I mean we were covering it back in [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=309.84000000000003s)]
*  May of 2021. In Arizona, Republican state legislators stripped Secretary of State Katie [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=314.48s)]
*  Hobs a Democrat of her ability to defend election lawsuits. And it gave the power to who? Well, [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=320.96s)]
*  exclusively to the Attorney General, a Republican. We are watching essentially a slow-motion [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=326.23999999999995s)]
*  insurrection being carried out by Republicans in suits and ties in states all across the country. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=331.44s)]
*  They are putting the pieces in place to do in the next elections what the mob failed to do [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=337.12s)]
*  on January 6th. And that slow-motion insurrection, this idea from the right wing that the power of [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=342.15999999999997s)]
*  self-governance does not sit in the hands of the people, the idea that the power and oversight of [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=348.48s)]
*  elections belongs to basically Republican self-gerrymandered majorities in the state level, [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=353.68s)]
*  that idea, that core idea is the subject of today's monumental Supreme Court ruling. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=360.16s)]
*  The case is out of the state of North Carolina. It's called Moore v. Harper. And in it, North [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=365.04s)]
*  Carolina Republicans argued that this independent state legislature theory gave them virtually [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=369.04s)]
*  unchecked power over elections. The lawmakers argument hinges on a political concept called [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=375.2s)]
*  the independent state legislature theory based on the Constitution's election clause saying, [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=381.03999999999996s)]
*  the time, place and manner of holding elections for senators and representatives [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=386.08s)]
*  shall be prescribed in each state by the legislature thereof. So if the court lands on the side of North [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=390.32s)]
*  Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore and his Republican colleagues, Fredrickson explains it could mean [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=395.59999999999997s)]
*  state legislatures can act independently and governors and state courts would have no ability [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=400.64s)]
*  to check laws related to federal election. Well, today in a 63 ruling, the Supreme Court rejected [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=406.08s)]
*  that extreme, extreme and dangerous legal theory, not to say one completely unfounded in the text [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=411.68s)]
*  of the Constitution. The case centers around an extremely aggressive partisan North Carolina [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=418.0s)]
*  congressional math drawn by Republican in the Republican, the state legislature, very [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=422.64s)]
*  gerrymandered using 2020 census data. And it's a map that would give Republicans up to 10 seats in [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=428.48s)]
*  the House. In early 2022, the North Carolina Supreme Court threw out that gerrymandered map and [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=434.32s)]
*  rejected Republicans arguments that state courts had no role to play in drawing congressional maps. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=440.88s)]
*  And then conservatives tried to go over the state court's head, challenge the ruling on the cart and [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=446.64000000000004s)]
*  went to the Supreme Court to argue that the Constitution gives them and only them, us in the [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=451.44s)]
*  state legislature, the only and total power over how we draw congressional maps. State courts don't [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=457.36s)]
*  matter. Well, today, the conservative Supreme Court that Donald Trump is responsible for shaping [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=463.76s)]
*  plainly rejected this radical and dare I say it, kooky notion. Chief Justice John Roberts authored [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=468.56s)]
*  the 6 to 3 opinion with both Trump appointed justices Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=475.84000000000003s)]
*  siding with the liberals. Justice Clarence Thomas, Samuel Leto, Neil Gorsuch dissented. [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=480.32s)]
*  In his opinion for the majority, Chief Justice wrote that quote, legislatures, the framers [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=485.68s)]
*  recognized are the mere creatures of the state constitutions and cannot be greater than their [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=490.32000000000005s)]
*  creators. Meaning the state government as a whole functions to oversee elections. If there's a state [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=495.68s)]
*  constitution that's interpreted by state courts, they get a say. State legislatures aren't some like [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=504.24s)]
*  special magical power that overrules everything in a state that's ludicrous. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=509.76s)]
*  This is the second pro-democracy ruling from this very right-wing court this term alone. Remember, [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=515.6800000000001s)]
*  a few weeks ago, they also upheld crucially section two of the Voting Rights Act and struck [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=521.52s)]
*  down a flagrantly biased Alabama congressional map. And I can't read the minds of the justices, [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=525.6s)]
*  particularly Roberts and Kavanaugh, who are the majority in both opinions, but I have to think [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=532.0s)]
*  the sustained focus amongst the press and civil society and politicians on the very real, [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=536.64s)]
*  indeed existential threats to the American experiment as posed by [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=543.28s)]
*  John Eastman, Donald Trump and his movement. The focus on that has shaped the court's thinking. [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=547.36s)]
*  And thank goodness for that. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=553.5999999999999s)]
*  Okay. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0dOkqLF4NDs&t=565.92s)]
