Video Description: New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu on GOP 2024 candidates: “Every one of them has to call him out. If you’re not calling out Donald Trump for the non-Republican that he really is, for the mistakes he made in the past, then you don’t deserve to be on the stage.”

# Sununu to GOP hopefuls: If you don’t call out Trump, you don’t deserve to run
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w)
*  The Republican primary field for 2024 is getting more crowded by the day. You may have noticed [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=0.0s)]
*  that with Chris Christie, Mike Pence and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum all expected to [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=6.16s)]
*  enter the race this week. But today, one other Republican who was considered a possible candidate [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=11.08s)]
*  announced that he's not running. New Hampshire Governor Kristen Nunu, a moderate self-described [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=16.96s)]
*  pro-choice Republican who handily won reelection to a fourth term last year, writes in a Washington [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=21.92s)]
*  Post op-ed that quote, our party is on a collision course toward electoral irrelevance without [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=27.4s)]
*  significant, significant corrective action. And that quote, the stakes are too high for [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=33.36s)]
*  a crowded field to hand the nomination to a candidate who earns just 35% of the vote. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=39.32s)]
*  And I will help ensure this does not happen. Strong words there. We all know which Republican [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=44.64s)]
*  primary candidate he means. I think we know. And Governor Sununu joins me now. So let's [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=49.2s)]
*  start with an announcement that we're going to see in New Hampshire tomorrow. Former [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=55.24s)]
*  New Jersey Governor Chris Christie is going to make his run official in your home state. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=62.0s)]
*  You neither of you hold back in criticizing Donald Trump. You have that in common. Do [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=65.96000000000001s)]
*  you think he has a path to beat Donald Trump in the primary? Oh, sure. Look, I think almost [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=70.88s)]
*  all the candidates have a very viable path to beating Donald Trump. And you know, you [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=77.08s)]
*  just said it right there. Chris isn't shy about casting criticism where it is well deserved [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=80.76s)]
*  with the former president. But this is the problem. All 12 of the other candidates need [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=86.04s)]
*  to cast the same type of criticism because it's not that we're out there to beat Donald [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=90.80000000000001s)]
*  Trump. Donald Trump doesn't represent the Republican Party, right? He's the outsider. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=97.08000000000001s)]
*  And we've kind of let him get away with kind of co-opting, I think, what are better traditional [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=101.2s)]
*  He wants to relitigate the past. And if we're going to be successful in the Republican Party, [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=107.4s)]
*  we got to move forward in the future. So I think Chris is a very good candidate. I think [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=113.84s)]
*  they're all really good candidates. They're all my friends. I think there's a lot to play [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=116.76s)]
*  out. We haven't even had a debate yet. So we're going to see who can take a punch, who [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  can give a punch, who can really stand on that stage and make the case of America's [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=123.72s)]
*  future, not just worrying about litigating the past. Well, we know Governor Christie [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=127.56s)]
*  can give a punch. We don't know what his path is yet. We'll see. But I do want to give you [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=131.62s)]
*  an opportunity to make a little news. So are you going to endorse Governor Christie tomorrow [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=136.42000000000002s)]
*  when he's in your home state? No, look, I love Chris. He's one of my better friends, [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=139.98000000000002s)]
*  really. But no, I may endorse somebody at some point, but that'll be down the road. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=145.18s)]
*  They got to earn it, right? They got to be in the living rooms of New Hampshire. They [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=149.58s)]
*  got to go to the 99 counties in Iowa. They got to go to the fairs. They got to do the [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=152.34s)]
*  retail politics because that proves a sense of good retail management. And that's exactly [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=155.78s)]
*  what this country is looking for. Good retail managers that don't just talk about their [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=161.14s)]
*  issues, but that can listen and talk to the issues that are actually resonating with the [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=165.38s)]
*  constituents. And that's the real difference. It's not about money or headlines or any of [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=169.89999999999998s)]
*  that. It's about really connecting with people. So as you're watching this, you said very [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=174.66s)]
*  clearly that if a candidate isn't breaking through, they need to drop out by Christmas. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=178.17999999999998s)]
*  I've been in politics a while. Candidates don't usually like to be told when to drop [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=182.82s)]
*  out. But are you going to be calling out specific candidates in public when you think it's time [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=186.14s)]
*  for them to go? If not publicly, are you going to be having these conversations privately? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=190.54s)]
*  What can we expect? No, look, it's not just me. I think there'll be a lot of voices calling [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=194.9s)]
*  out candidates. They got plenty of time, though. We have all fallen to prove themselves and [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=200.66s)]
*  anyone who wants to get in can get in. But it's not just the Chris Sununas of the world. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=204.38s)]
*  It's, I think, going to be a lot of voices. They're going to be telling folks, hey, you [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=208.89999999999998s)]
*  gave it a shot. It's not there. The donor base, the donor base that has given money [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=211.45999999999998s)]
*  to these candidates have to be actually the first ones to say, I know I gave you a lot [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=215.66s)]
*  of money. It's not happening. Pull out. Let's narrow this field down. So it really has to [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=219.02s)]
*  be a resonating message. So we don't have a repeat of 16. It looks like according to [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=223.3s)]
*  a lot of legal eagles, we could see another indictment for Donald Trump soon. Now we know [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=227.98000000000002s)]
*  the hush money indictment didn't seem to change the dynamic of anything. It seemed to help [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=232.66000000000003s)]
*  him in the polls. Do you think any indictment, an indictment on issues around other indictments [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=236.26000000000002s)]
*  could help other candidates or would hurt Trump? No, you don't think the indictments [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=242.02s)]
*  matter? No, no. I don't want to put words in your mouth. Obviously they don't. They don't. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=245.38s)]
*  They absolutely don't matter. No, these indictments, and if I may, a combination of the media, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=249.7s)]
*  you're creating the boy who cried wolf syndrome, right? What happened in New York was wrong. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=254.66s)]
*  I mean, it really was. They are beating up on Trump for political reasons. Everybody sees that. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=261.21999999999997s)]
*  What happened with the Russian collusion that never existed effectively exonerated the guy. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=265.62s)]
*  So he can play a victim card. You've all created a situation where God, what kind of planet are we [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=270.5s)]
*  on where Donald Trump has become the victim? Well, that's really what it is. I think we very, [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=275.62s)]
*  now nobody believes it. Nobody believes it. We know I have to stop you on there because we know [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=279.38s)]
*  very clearly that Putin and the Kremlin did intervene in our election in order to try to [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=282.98s)]
*  help Donald Trump back in 2016. So we know that it's true, but you may think that they shouldn't [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=287.86s)]
*  engage in this as a messaging tool because it's not helpful to them. Is that what you're saying? [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=292.74s)]
*  Yeah. Yeah. I'm not going to re-litigate the Russian collusion nonsense that went on for two [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=297.86s)]
*  years where everyone said that it was real. You don't need to re-litigate it. It's been litigated [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=303.22s)]
*  by lawyers and investigations. Yeah, yeah. It's nonsense. But now nobody buys that any attack on [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=305.78000000000003s)]
*  Trump isn't anything but political. Everyone has kind of created this scenario, and he is playing [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=314.42s)]
*  it to the fullest. He is playing the violin strings better than anyone imagined, which is [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=319.62s)]
*  why his poll numbers miraculously are actually going up. So these candidates are going to have [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=323.46s)]
*  to get on the stage, talk about what they're going to do going forward. Every one of them has to call [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=327.78s)]
*  them out. If you're not calling out Donald Trump for the non-Republican that he really is, for the [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=331.78s)]
*  mistakes he made in the past, then you don't deserve to be on the stage. We're not here to [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=336.97999999999996s)]
*  run for vice president. We're not here to sell books. If you want to be president, then you [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=341.14s)]
*  better stand up and give it everything you got. And those candidates that don't do that aren't [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=344.34s)]
*  going to go very far. They're going to be driven out of the race. And we're going to get down to [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=348.26s)]
*  one or two candidates because one on one, Trump and somebody else, he loses. He loses the nomination. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=351.22s)]
*  And then the Republicans actually have a shot to win in 24. I think almost anybody would beat Joe [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=356.74s)]
*  Biden right now in 24, except Donald Trump. So I want to ask you about abortion. We've talked [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=361.46000000000004s)]
*  about this a little bit before. The range of candidates in the field have a lot of different [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=367.3s)]
*  positions. You're a pro-choice governor. What do you think the position of the party should be, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=371.54s)]
*  and how should these candidates be talking about it on the trail? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=377.46s)]
*  Look, I think it's really simple. Dobbs now says that the states can make their decisions and they [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=381.62s)]
*  will. And everyone has to understand that California and Mississippi are going to have very [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=386.5s)]
*  different paths on abortion. And that's now up to the voters to decide whether they want those [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=390.34s)]
*  legislatures and those governors to make those decisions. And so there's more voter connection [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=394.97999999999996s)]
*  there. That's the new reality. So anything that the Republicans are talking about in terms of [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=398.82s)]
*  national abortion bans and all that, it becomes a very scary message that can't be explained. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=403.3s)]
*  And you drive independence and young voters away. And that's exactly the opposite of what we should [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=407.94s)]
*  be doing. We've got to bring them back onto the team. We've got to make them feel empowered, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=412.18s)]
*  get them excited about something, not confuse them with national abortion ban message. It just, [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=415.3s)]
*  it isn't what carries the day. We need to talk about inflation and energy independence and [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=419.86s)]
*  healthcare reform, border security. These are the things that really matter at a national level [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=423.54s)]
*  and can be fixed. And if we're talking about abortion, we're getting distracted and probably [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=428.90000000000003s)]
*  losing voters in the process. New Hampshire governor, Kristen Nunu. Thank you so much [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=432.66s)]
*  for joining me this evening at a big day. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxKp2kf1V3w&t=436.5s)]
