Video Description: Yusef Salaam talks about his campaign for a New York City council seat, which he is now well positioned to win, and how it was shaped by his experience being wrongly convicted in a high profile crime that even had Donald Trump calling for his execution, only to be exonorated years later and have to put his life back together.

# Candidate turns lessons of public, personal struggle into winning platform
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 03, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng)
*  I am here because Harlem, you believed in me. Harlem has spoken. I've often said on [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=0.0s)]
*  the campaign trail, I am not a seasoned politician. So therefore this was not politics as usual. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=10.38s)]
*  I got the opportunity to include in my campaign the voice of the people. The fact that people [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=22.28s)]
*  had hope in a person whose experience has lasted 34 years because that's how long I [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=29.82s)]
*  was fighting for freedom, justice and equality. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=39.78s)]
*  That was Youssef Salam, who you might remember as a member of the Central Park Five, the [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=43.9s)]
*  black and Latino teens who were wrongfully arrested, convicted and incarcerated for the [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=48.58s)]
*  rape and assault of a woman in Central Park in 1989. Donald Trump famously took out newspaper [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=53.22s)]
*  ads at the time and called for the death penalty for the Five. Well today they are known as [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=59.82s)]
*  the exonerated Five after DNA evidence proves someone else committed the crime. And Youssef [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=64.7s)]
*  Salam is now the front runner in the Democratic primary race for Harlem's 9th City Council [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=70.22s)]
*  District. Now a winner has not been officially declared, but Salam won twice the number of [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=75.9s)]
*  votes as his nearest competitor, a sitting assemblywoman who's been a fixture in local [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=81.42s)]
*  New York City politics and previously held that very council seat. So there is a strong [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=85.54s)]
*  likelihood that he will not only win the primary, but also win the heavily Democratic 9th District [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=90.10000000000001s)]
*  seat in November. As Youssef Salam points out, he might be a political outsider, but [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=95.66000000000001s)]
*  he's no stranger to being in the public eye. Salam was, he's poised to win an election [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=100.62s)]
*  for a public office as part of a new generation of politicians once operating adjacent to [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=106.46000000000001s)]
*  the political party apparatus. And now they've decided to get involved. That is a power shift [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=112.7s)]
*  and it's getting the attention of leaders in the community he hopes to serve. Here's [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=117.78s)]
*  what Michael A. Walrond Jr., a pastor at First Corinthian Baptist Church in Harlem, told [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=122.22s)]
*  the New York Times about Salam's nearest competitor. He said, quote, endorsed by the institutions, [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=128.3s)]
*  the names and it didn't help. It is definitely a signal that in Harlem, at least right now, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=135.38s)]
*  the politics is a little bit more open than it may have been 10 or 15 years ago. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=141.22s)]
*  Well, joining us now is Youssef Salam, the candidate for New York City's 9th District [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=147.06s)]
*  seat. He's also, as I said, one of the exonerated five. It is good to see you, sir. Thank you [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=153.14s)]
*  for making some time this evening for us. Let's start with talking about this election [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=158.38s)]
*  in this primary because you won twice as many votes as your closest competitor. Inez Dickens [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=164.18s)]
*  really held that seat for at least 10 years. Why do you think that voters resonated with [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=170.74s)]
*  you in this way, that they came out to support you so much? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=176.9s)]
*  You know, the thing about our beloved Harlem is that people have been pushed to the back. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=180.3s)]
*  They've been left out. They've been divested of. And I think the pain is so apparent. There's [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=186.74s)]
*  been so many people that have been looking for hope. They've been wanting hope. They've [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=192.06s)]
*  been needing hope. And the fact of the matter is that, you know, we have to occupy all spaces [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=195.18s)]
*  if we're not at the table, we're the ones that are on the menu and they are deciding [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=200.7s)]
*  for us what our lives are going to look like. And, you know, when I think about my story, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=204.98s)]
*  my struggles, here I was marching for 12 years after we were found innocent. Me and my brothers [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=210.54s)]
*  were out there in the streets marching for justice. There was no one in the halls of [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=216.28s)]
*  power to hear our voices. And the fact that I now had the opportunity, I would say, to [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=220.29999999999998s)]
*  lead our people. Leadership is service. And how best to serve them by being one of those [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=227.46s)]
*  who understands exactly where the pain is at, understands the voices of our people, [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=233.94s)]
*  and says, you know what, I'm going to do something about it. I am going to carry your voices [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=238.82s)]
*  into the halls of power. I'm going to speak truth to power. My word is going to be my [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=243.74s)]
*  bond. And this will not be politics as usual. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=248.58s)]
*  You know, a recent Fox News poll found that trust in our institutions are actually reaching [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=253.66000000000003s)]
*  record lows with faith in Congress down to 34 percent among registered voters. We don't [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=258.96000000000004s)]
*  even need to talk about the Supreme Court. Do you think that your outsider status really [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=264.86s)]
*  worked in your favor given that growing sentiment? Because people didn't view you as a part of [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=270.2s)]
*  the institution, they maybe trusted you more? [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=275.7s)]
*  I think that really, really played a great part in the fact that here it is 34 years [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=279.86s)]
*  later. This case was a case that really trampled upon Black and brown bodies in our [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=284.5s)]
*  communities. You know, the names Raymond Santana, Kevin Richardson, Corey Wise, [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=289.38s)]
*  Antron McCray and Youssef Salam are part of the fabric of what was considered wrong [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=294.12s)]
*  with America and now considered, wow, this is this is now case study. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=300.58s)]
*  We need to figure out how we can ensure, in fact, that people don't go to prison for [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=305.42s)]
*  crimes that they didn't commit. And here it is. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=310.34000000000003s)]
*  I could have been a private citizen, but I think the beauty of my story is that I've [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=312.90000000000003s)]
*  come to use the same platform that I've had. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=317.1s)]
*  And I said, you know what, I'm going to help. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=320.86s)]
*  I am going to use it to effectuate the greatest change in my community, because I know we [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=323.34000000000003s)]
*  can't change things in two years. I know we can't change things in four years, but we [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=329.02000000000004s)]
*  can start a movement. And that movement includes all of us, because just like my mother told [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=333.34s)]
*  me when I was 15, she said they need you to participate in whatever it is they're trying [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=337.85999999999996s)]
*  to do. Do not participate, she said, refuse. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=343.06s)]
*  And so when I think about all of the ills that are invading our community, the fact [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=346.21999999999997s)]
*  that there's an effort trying to capture our minds, because this is a mental war that we [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=353.34s)]
*  are fighting against. If they can get me to accept that I am inferior and that they are [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=359.12s)]
*  superior, then I lost. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=366.24s)]
*  Every single one of us was born on purpose. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=370.16s)]
*  And the beauty of coexisting is allowing for the greatest greatness that is inside of us [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=372.16s)]
*  to to ooze out, because psychosocially, if I am re-embraced by society, guess what I do? [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=377.68s)]
*  I give the very best of myself. And society in turn gives the very best of themselves. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=384.8s)]
*  And so this is a movement into our future that will literally span the next 50 to 100 years or more. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=390.72s)]
*  And I'm telling us we have to begin to plan in 100 year cycles, because that's what matters. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=398.56s)]
*  We got to be at the table. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=404.8s)]
*  I'm sorry to interrupt you, sir, but this point you're making about a movement, I find it very interesting, [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=407.04s)]
*  because I used to advise a lot of candidates back in the day. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=411.56s)]
*  And I always found it that it was easier, if you will, to campaign than it was to govern. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=417.32s)]
*  And while the votes are still being counted, I think it's safe to say that your win in November [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=423.56s)]
*  is nearly a foregone conclusion. And at that point, you will no longer be an outsider. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=427.64s)]
*  You will be a politician. You will be a person on the inside. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=433.88s)]
*  And as you were talking about these issues, you've listed affordable housing in a number of the interviews [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=437.56s)]
*  and on the campaign trail, education funding, policing as some of the biggest issues affecting District 9 [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=442.76s)]
*  that you want to tackle. And it seems to me you are laying the groundwork that that is something [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=449.16s)]
*  that you won't get done in one year or two years. Is it that you're building a coalition here? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=455.88s)]
*  You're trying to bring people along in the political process to understand how change actually takes place? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=461.72s)]
*  Absolutely. You know, on my platform, Harlem4Usep.com, I've laid it all out. [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=467.8s)]
*  And what I'm really trying to get people to see is that people want a miracle. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=472.6s)]
*  And a miracle is happening right in front of our faces. That's what resonates with people. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=478.36s)]
*  When they see me, they don't see just an individual who's saying, you know what, I want to run for office. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=484.36s)]
*  I think I'm going to make it. They see a person who was damaged by society, who was counted out, [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=489.56s)]
*  who then said, I'm going to bet on myself. But more than that, what I represent for our people [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=496.92s)]
*  is the very hope that we all need, that it's possible. Because if I could resuscitate my life [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=504.04s)]
*  through the grace of God, we most certainly can resuscitate our lives. The problem is that [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=510.2s)]
*  we are the secret ingredient and we have a huge mountain to lift. But we lift as we climb, [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=516.52s)]
*  as the young people told me so brilliantly. We have to be about that. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=524.1999999999999s)]
*  Before I let you go, sir, I want to get your reaction to someone I think you're quite familiar with. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=529.72s)]
*  We're learning that special counsel Jack Smith is speaking to more people in Donald Trump's circle [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=534.52s)]
*  as he investigates his role in January 6th. That is, of course, just one of several investigations [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=539.8s)]
*  into Trump. Can I just get your reaction to the legal issues that Donald Trump is facing? [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=545.0s)]
*  You know, I've said it very succinctly, karma, because, you know, unfortunately, [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=551.88s)]
*  what has been played out in our communities, we've got this idea that we are in a United [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=558.52s)]
*  States of America, but we as black people know that we are in the divided States of America. [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=564.92s)]
*  It's always been separate and unequal. And the truth of the matter is that even when I hold [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=570.28s)]
*  out hope, stating that I hope that he gets the opportunity to get the justice that eluded us, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=574.92s)]
*  I know that you're supposed to be innocent until proven guilty. But when they look at the color of [[00:09:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=581.0799999999999s)]
*  our skin, they see guilty, guilty, guilty. But when you have the complexion for so-called protection, [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=585.56s)]
*  you get every opportunity under the law to get the proper, the law to work for you. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=592.5999999999999s)]
*  And that's the challenge, us to be able to see it, us to see the juxtaposition, [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=600.28s)]
*  us to be able to understand what's really going on. It is technology. But at the same time, [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=604.28s)]
*  we have to know as good as the good people we are. And I'm going to call us that we have never [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=610.76s)]
*  wanted revenge. We have only wanted equality, and we definitely need equity. And so when I think [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=616.4399999999999s)]
*  about here we are on the cusp of seeing some miracle happen again and again and again, [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=623.72s)]
*  we are living in prophecy and we have to all take heed. It's about what we do with our hands, [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=631.0s)]
*  what we do with our feet, because all of that stuff is going to come back to us. And we have [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=638.04s)]
*  to be righteous actors in everything that we do. Youssef Salam, thank you very much for joining us [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=643.24s)]
*  tonight. Appreciate it. My absolute pleasure. And thank you as well. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=650.44s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:11:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tguTios7Nng&t=660.36s)]
