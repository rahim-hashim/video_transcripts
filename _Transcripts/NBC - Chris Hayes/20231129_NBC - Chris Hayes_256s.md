# Hunter Biden calls bluff of House Republicans in ‘absolutely humiliating' blow
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec)
*  If you have not been watching Fox News, you may not be aware of the drama and intrigue they and their Republican allies have jimmed up around the president's son, Hunter Biden. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=0.0s)]
*  But you should know that while you have been following news on all sorts of other topics, the Fox cinematic universe has been attacking President Biden and his son day in, day out, all day long. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=9.0s)]
*  Now, this line of attack could, in theory, at least, be rather effective. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=19.0s)]
*  The problem is they're working with very bad material. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=24.0s)]
*  And they keep running into absolutely humiliating dead ends. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=27.0s)]
*  Now they have hit perhaps the most humiliating one yet. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=31.0s)]
*  The right-wing campaign against Hunter Biden has been going on for years. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=34.0s)]
*  Even before Joe Biden took office, Biden's political opponents seized on his son's well-known and widely acknowledged personal problems, including his struggle with addiction, as well as his, like, you know, foreign business dealings that a lot of people thought were not great in an attempt to disparage the president. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=37.0s)]
*  They built up a whole narrative about the Biden crime family and promised that Hunter was the key to bringing them down. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=54.0s)]
*  Amidst this scrutiny, Hunter disclosed in December of 2020 that he was under investigation by the Justice Department related to his tax affairs. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=61.0s)]
*  Republicans then complained the DOJ was not charging Biden until they, well, did indict him this year on gun charges related to his drug use. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=69.0s)]
*  Now to be clear, these are charges that many prosecutors and many defense lawyers who practice in the federal bar say would never be brought against someone without that last name. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=78.0s)]
*  This is a special case. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=87.0s)]
*  Republicans were also incensed by the lack of a special counsel on the case. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=89.0s)]
*  That is until Attorney General Merrick Garland appointed a special counsel in August. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=93.0s)]
*  This year, House Republicans also launched their own probe into the Biden family, helped by Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer of Kentucky. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=98.0s)]
*  They expanded that into an impeachment inquiry. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=106.0s)]
*  They didn't take a vote on it, along with two other committees in September. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=109.0s)]
*  Comer and his teams have now spent months putting out a steady stream of anti-Biden content, doing everything they can to promote an impeachment story and impeachment news segments on Fox, short of actually voting on impeachment for the president because, well, they don't have enough support to pass that. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=113.0s)]
*  Of course, a large part of what is driving all this is an instinct for revenge for the two impeachments of Donald Trump. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=131.0s)]
*  Trump has ordered them to impeach Joe Biden, and, well, we know what they do when he orders them to do something. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=136.0s)]
*  So they want to even the score. Trump wants to even the score. Facts be damned. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=142.0s)]
*  Now, this is the key point. They have uncovered no actual evidence to support an impeachment of Joe Biden. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=146.0s)]
*  The inquiry has provided the House Republicans with a great opportunity to subpoena Hunter. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=151.0s)]
*  Chairman Comer issued that subpoena earlier this month, summoning Hunter Biden for a closed door transcribed interview. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=157.0s)]
*  And now Hunter Biden has called their bluff. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=163.0s)]
*  Yesterday, through his lawyer, Hunter Biden told Republicans, sure, I'll come in and talk to you. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=166.0s)]
*  And not just that, I will come in and testify live in public before the whole committee. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=170.0s)]
*  You know, you would think that would be precisely the sort of dramatic confrontational moment Republicans have been waiting for. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=176.0s)]
*  They're trying to produce cable news for their friends over at Fox after all. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=183.0s)]
*  But instead of declaring victory and putting the date in ink, James Comer just folded, claiming a public hearing would not suffice. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=188.0s)]
*  We need to ask him hundreds of questions. If he comes in for one hearing with 24 members having five minutes each to ask questions with the Democrat yelling and screaming like they do every hearing, [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=198.0s)]
*  we would probably get about 30 to 35 questions in. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=210.0s)]
*  After years building up this climactic moment, the opportunity to grill Hunter Biden under oath in front of the country, Republicans retreated from their own battle. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=213.0s)]
*  This has to be the most humiliating loss for James Comer yet. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=223.0s)]
*  And there have been a lot. I'll talk to his Democratic counterpart on the Oversight Committee ranking member Jamie Raskin all about it next. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=226.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBOpr98g5ec&t=240.0s)]
