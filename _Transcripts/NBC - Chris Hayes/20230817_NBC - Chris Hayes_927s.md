*  Tonight the DA requests a start date as all the networks prepare for the trial. Oh my goodness all the networks [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=30.900000000000002s)]
*  Wow [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=39.78s)]
*  Then why a federal judge [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=42.06s)]
*  Suggested Elon Musk was protecting Donald Trump from the production of his Twitter DMs [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=44.18000000000001s)]
*  Plus real evidence that 91 criminal charges across four indictments is actually having an effect on Trump voters and [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=49.18s)]
*  One year after it was signed the simple math and wild success of the inflation reduction act but all in starts right now [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=57.699999999999996s)]
*  Good evening from New York [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=69.58s)]
*  I'm Chris Hayes Donald Trump and his 18 co-defendants in that Rico indictment must turn themselves in at the Fulton County jail in [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=70.97999999999999s)]
*  Atlanta, Georgia within nine days and there they will be booked processed and have mugshots taken ahead of their arraignments [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=78.62s)]
*  Which district attorney Fonny Willis wants to take place the first week of September [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=86.5s)]
*  Today Willis also proposed a trial date for this case about the efforts to overturn the 2020 election in Georgia and elsewhere [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=92.02s)]
*  She requests it begin on March 4th of next year. That is the day before Super Tuesday [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=99.94s)]
*  Now, of course, there's one name that stands out above all the others in this sweeping indictment [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=106.98s)]
*  It's listed first Donald Trump [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=111.5s)]
*  But the second most well-known name here is of course Rudolph William Louis Giuliani [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=112.78s)]
*  And we've been expecting this for quite some time [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=118.58s)]
*  We've been expecting to see Rudy Giuliani his name on this indictment ever since prosecutors in Willis's office [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=120.82000000000001s)]
*  Informed Giuliani. He was a target of the investigation about a year ago [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=128.14s)]
*  But it is still a remarkable fall from grace for a man who was once a pretty widely renowned public figure [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=133.5s)]
*  Giuliani rose to national prominence as the star United States attorney for the Southern District of New York a job [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=141.61999999999998s)]
*  He held from 1983 to 1989 [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=148.39999999999998s)]
*  There he oversaw the prosecutions of members of the mob drug dealers corrupt government officials earned a tough-on-crime [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=151.14s)]
*  reputation which he used to launch his political career [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=158.38s)]
*  After Giuliani became mayor of New York in 1993, he astutely cultivated the image as the man [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=162.0s)]
*  Single-handedly responsible just him for cleaning up the city and bringing law and order [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=168.84s)]
*  Then in the wake of September 11th, he was America's mayor [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=173.96s)]
*  Rudy was even an early front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 though. That didn't go that well and [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=178.48s)]
*  Now here in the year 2023 at 79 years old Rudy Giuliani has been indicted for his role in what prosecutors call a criminal [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  enterprise [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  He's an alleged racketeer [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=194.44s)]
*  the one-time future president a disgraced laughingstock I [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=197.88s)]
*  Mean in recent years he's been best known for a series of half comical half villainous [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=202.08s)]
*  Excavades like presenting ludicrous claims of voter fraud in front of the four seasons total landscaping [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=207.56s)]
*  And in another press conference a few weeks later with hair dye trickling down his sweat streaked face [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=213.84s)]
*  His awful and almost unreadable conversations with the subordinate are all over the internet. I'm at a really unsettling sexual harassment [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=220.16s)]
*  lawsuit [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=228.28s)]
*  He's even a punchline in a Borat movie in the final chapter of his life [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=229.36s)]
*  Rudy Giuliani is the object of ridicule and scorn. He is reputationally and financially [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=234.12s)]
*  your bankruptcy [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=241.16s)]
*  He is looking at the possibility of living out the rest of his days on this earth in prison [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=242.79999999999998s)]
*  How did it happen? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=249.88s)]
*  How did the once clean as a whistle crime fighter the law and order man? [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=251.48s)]
*  America's mayor who led us through one of our darkest hours. How did he end up like this? What happened to Rudy? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=255.23999999999998s)]
*  You hear that a lot. I [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=262.12s)]
*  Would submit if you take a closer look there's a case to be made [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=264.48s)]
*  Rudy has actually been this version of Rudy the whole time or at least had it in him. I [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=269.04s)]
*  Mean, in fact Rudy himself made a pretty revealing statement to that effect last night when he emerged from his shame bunker to address the indictment [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=275.76000000000005s)]
*  This is a ridiculous application of the racketeering statute. There's probably no one that knows it [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=284.8s)]
*  Better than I do probably some that know it as well as the first one to use it in white colloquy [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=291.0s)]
*  But in major cases like the Boesky case and the Milken case this is not meant for [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=296.24s)]
*  Election disputes. I mean, this is ridiculous what she's doing [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=303.8s)]
*  Now credit would do Rudy is correct [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=308.68s)]
*  He really did pioneer the use of racketeering laws often shorthanded as Rico to go after white-collar criminals [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=310.71999999999997s)]
*  It was it was a sort of innovation of his like Michael Milken as he mentioned in that interview [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=316.56s)]
*  He brought Rico charges against the mob the five families in New York helping to bring down, you know organized crime in New York [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=321.84s)]
*  According to new reporting from the messenger wise guys are rejoicing in the wake of Giuliani's own Rico indictment [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=329.4s)]
*  A veteran mob lawyer says his clients are quote effing thrilled [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=335.53999999999996s)]
*  Giuliani also used the Rico laws to go after corruption in politics and one of the ways that he kick-started his own [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=340.59999999999997s)]
*  Electoral career in the city of New York was turning his office the US Attorney's office [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=347.23999999999995s)]
*  Attention to the Democratic political machine of the city, which he was of course going to run against in the race for mayor in [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=353.91999999999996s)]
*  1986 he took down Stanley Friedman on racketeering charges [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=362.23999999999995s)]
*  That was a Democrat from the Bronx one of New York's most powerful political figures as the New York Times put it at the time [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=365.2s)]
*  And by his own admission Rudy used Rico laws against his political enemies including the man whose job he wanted [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=372.12s)]
*  Democratic Mayor Ed Koch [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=379.0s)]
*  The Rico statute I was the first one to use the racketeering statute for public corruption [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=381.52s)]
*  I did it against most of Ed Koch's administration [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=388.64s)]
*  Well, it wasn't paying attention well, they were stealing millions [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=396.2s)]
*  Now think about this the US Attorney who clearly wants political office in the city [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=400.52000000000004s)]
*  prosecuting the opposing party right using the power to do that you might [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=405.24s)]
*  Uncharitably call that weaponizing the Justice Department for partisan political lands [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=410.28000000000003s)]
*  Now Giuliani lost his first race for mayor in New York, but he succeeded the second time around [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=414.96000000000004s)]
*  After embracing some of the ugliest most demagogic racist politics that Donald Trump would later mine to great effect [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=420.20000000000005s)]
*  In September of 1992 he rather infamously appeared at a police rally that turned into an all-out riot [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=427.9s)]
*  And he refused to ever to cry or denounce it [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=434.3s)]
*  As mayor Giuliani oversaw an incredible increase in the surveillance and policing of black and brown New Yorkers in one notorious incident [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=437.86s)]
*  He demonized an unarmed black man who was shot and killed by the police [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=445.18s)]
*  Clearly even his recent turn as a public face of frankly racist accusations of voter fraud is not really new [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=449.53999999999996s)]
*  tape earlier in the day of Ruby Freeman and Shea Freeman Mars and one other gentleman [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=457.14s)]
*  Quite obviously surreptitiously passing around [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=464.46s)]
*  USB ports as if they are vials of heroin or cocaine. I [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=468.3s)]
*  Mean, it's our state. It's obvious to anyone who's a criminal investigator or prosecutor [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=472.94s)]
*  They are engaged in surreptitiously illegal activity again that day [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=478.06s)]
*  Now that was false and and Ruby Freeman and Shea Moss have actually sued Rudy Giuliani for defamation [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=482.41999999999996s)]
*  But that kind of rhetoric talking about these two black women as being [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=488.9s)]
*  drug dealers [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=493.5s)]
*  Stealing an election that goes way back from the 1989 race for rare the 1989 race for mayor [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=494.94s)]
*  which Julie lost to the first black man elected mayor in New York David Dinkins as [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=500.7s)]
*  As Giuliani himself told journalist Jack Newfield in an interview he quotes in his [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=505.58s)]
*  2002 book the full Rudy this is 21 years ago and I'm quoting him here [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=511.41999999999996s)]
*  They stole that election from me. They stole that votes in the black parts of Brooklyn and in Washington Heights [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=516.46s)]
*  illegal Dominican immigrants were allowed to vote in Washington Heights [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=523.66s)]
*  That sounds familiar doesn't it [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=528.9399999999999s)]
*  Has a certain ring to it [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=531.74s)]
*  Let me tell you as a lifelong New Yorker [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=533.74s)]
*  Reporters in New York City and critics will tell you Rudy Giuliani has always been an absolute Machiavellian [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=536.54s)]
*  operator [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=543.34s)]
*  So yeah, you might say what happened to Rudy or you could say [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=544.38s)]
*  This has always been Rudy all the way to the end [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=548.94s)]
*  Over the last several days we've learned that there was a long drawn-out legal battle in secret [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=554.7s)]
*  Between the special counsel's office and twitter over a warrant for twitter to turn over access to donald trump's account [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=560.46s)]
*  Including his direct messages or dm's [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=567.34s)]
*  Today, we've got a much fuller picture of that legal battle and of what was ultimately released to the special counsel [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=570.54s)]
*  And the the two sort of top-line takeaways are that trump did have lots of dm's what his lawyers called confidential communications [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=576.3000000000001s)]
*  Which the special counsel's office ultimately did get access to [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=583.58s)]
*  Which the special counsel's office ultimately did get access to [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=586.7s)]
*  And that elon musk's company did basically everything in its power to fight on trump's behalf including [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=590.5400000000001s)]
*  Resisting prosecutors demands that they not tell trump about the search warrant [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=596.6800000000001s)]
*  twitter's delay in complying with the warrant led the judge to hold it in contempt and hit it with a [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=601.74s)]
*  350,000 dollar fine Lisa Rubin is an MSNBC legal analyst who's been closely following this story and she joins me now [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=607.32s)]
*  So lisa, what are the new we we we sort of thought something was going on behind the curtains [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=613.82s)]
*  Then we got our first documents indicating some of the contours of this now today [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=618.62s)]
*  We got a bunch more that that really sort of show what went down. What did we get access to today? [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=622.86s)]
*  And what does it show? [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=628.0600000000001s)]
*  We got access to a number of transcripts [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=630.46s)]
*  Chris where the government and twitter's outside counsel are squaring off in front of one of maybe the toughest judges [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=633.02s)]
*  In the district of columbia's federal court judge barrel howell who I should note had intimate familiarity with what the special counsel's [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=639.9s)]
*  Offices have done in the past [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=647.98s)]
*  Why because she was the chief judge of the district and presided over all grand jury and stored communication disputes during the muller investigation [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=649.8199999999999s)]
*  And in fact uses that knowledge to really interrogate twitter's counsel saying [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=657.74s)]
*  Are you not aware of the fact that the muller team for example? [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=662.6999999999999s)]
*  Got over 230 orders just like this to access stored communication [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=666.46s)]
*  And do you think in any of those instances the special counsel's team went to the white house and said hey [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=671.5s)]
*  We're going to give you a heads up. We're looking for confidential communications. No, that's not how it went down [[00:11:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=676.94s)]
*  So she was in a particularly good position to really put the screws to twitter's counsel about their resistance to complying with her order [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=681.74s)]
*  Yeah, and and you know, I should say as a sort of general matter [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=689.66s)]
*  A social media company that is going to fight [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=693.4200000000001s)]
*  government attempts to [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=696.46s)]
*  Grab users accounts or data is is a good thing [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=698.62s)]
*  I think in most instances you want them to be sort of resistant to that idea [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=701.5s)]
*  I mean one of the things that howell points out if i'm not mistaken is that [[00:11:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=705.98s)]
*  twitter's been handing over stuff left and right and in fact, you know reporting shows that it's been handing over stuff left and right to [[00:11:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=710.1400000000001s)]
*  Really gnarly authoritarian governments and regimes where you know handing it over really spells doom [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=715.58s)]
*  Howell seems pretty pointed about like what exactly is your deal here with donald trump [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=721.58s)]
*  Right, and she basically accuses them of trying to compensate for the fact that under prior ownership [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=727.5s)]
*  Donald trump was kicked off of twitter and that elon musk [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=732.38s)]
*  Now may want to make nice with donald trump by giving him a heads up about something [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=735.74s)]
*  That's not appropriate to notify him about but at the end of the day [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=740.14s)]
*  She succeeds and the government succeeds and getting twitter to comply [[00:12:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=744.38s)]
*  Not only because she imposes a 350 000 sanction on them [[00:12:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=748.5400000000001s)]
*  But also because the government demonstrates to her its urgency [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=754.0600000000001s)]
*  So one of the things chris that left off the page to me is tom windham one of the prosecutors for the government basically saying [[00:12:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=758.46s)]
*  We needed this information 13 days ago. We're running up against an elapsing clock [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=764.38s)]
*  You can feel the timeliness of what they're trying to do and the rush in their investigation [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=770.0600000000001s)]
*  It's not to say it's overly rushed or you know impetuous [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=775.66s)]
*  But you feel some urgency from the government and saying we need twitter to comply and we needed them to comply yesterday [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=779.74s)]
*  I want to read from the the search warrant [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=786.7s)]
*  Uh for for trump's trailer account and the items that were sought include all direct messages sent received restored and draft form [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=788.78s)]
*  All devices used to log into at real donald trump location information ip addresses used to log into an account from october 2020 january [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=795.9s)]
*  2021 tweets created drafted favorited or liked including any deleted we so [[00:13:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=803.82s)]
*  The are we to believe and I believe that that that trump's lawyers at one point say this or maybe twitter's lawyer that there that [[00:13:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=809.9000000000001s)]
*  There were personal communications dms that the special counsel did get access to [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=816.3000000000001s)]
*  Yeah, and it comes up in the course of this fight about executive privilege that twitter is for reasons [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=822.22s)]
*  Unbeknownst to the government and barrel howell trying to vindicate right? They're not a government office [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=827.58s)]
*  And nonetheless, they're essentially saying well he might have executive privilege over some of these communications and howell says to them [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=831.9000000000001s)]
*  What would cause you to believe that and they said well, there's some volume of confidential communications here [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=838.7s)]
*  And she says how do you know that they're confidential and that's when they reveal [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=844.38s)]
*  Well, we looked in the dms folder to see if there was anything there if the folder is empty [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=848.62s)]
*  Then you can presume there are no confidential com [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=853.98s)]
*  Communications, but in actuality there's really some volume there now chris [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=856.84s)]
*  We don't know are those dms that trump received are those dms trump sent to me? [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=860.7s)]
*  Those are two very different things because particularly given what kind of settings you can put on your account [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=866.94s)]
*  Any old yahoo out there in the twitterverse might be able to send you a direct message [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=871.98s)]
*  But if they are ones that were sent and if we also learn about who had access to this account [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=876.14s)]
*  Which devices and ip addresses were involved we might learn a lot more ultimately about how trump's twitter account was used [[00:14:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=882.86s)]
*  By whom and whether it was sort of used in the way that paul manifort used his draft email folder, right as a staging ground [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=890.78s)]
*  What ultimately became his communications? [[00:14:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=898.86s)]
*  That's a great great point lisa rubin as always on point. Thank you very much [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=901.98s)]
*  You [[00:15:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M-3b02F3h4Y&t=920.62s)]
