# Watch The Beat with Ari Melber Highlights: June 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A)
*  Today the Justice Department unsealed an indictment of defendant Donald Trump for 37 counts. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=0.0s)]
*  We are covering this historic and unprecedented development with our legal experts who have [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=5.2s)]
*  been poring over this 44-page indictment since it was first unsealed this afternoon, a nation [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=9.36s)]
*  heard from special counsel Jack Smith, for actually the first time ever today. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=14.68s)]
*  A prosecutor known for his work and today his actions, indicting the former president [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=19.72s)]
*  after about seven months on the job, and he spoke clearly and concisely about this indictment [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=24.5s)]
*  and national security crimes. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=30.78s)]
*  Today an indictment was unsealed, charging Donald J. Trump with felony violations of [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=33.78s)]
*  our national security laws, conspiracy to obstruct justice, to understand the scope [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=40.26s)]
*  and the gravity of the crimes charged. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=45.94s)]
*  Our laws that protect national defense information are critical. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=47.94s)]
*  And they must be enforced. [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=52.42s)]
*  Violations of those laws put our country at risk. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=55.38s)]
*  Adherence to the rule of law is a bedrock principle. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=58.1s)]
*  Nothing more and nothing less. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=61.88s)]
*  My office will seek a speedy trial that the defendants in this case must be presumed innocent [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=64.78s)]
*  until proven guilty. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=70.74000000000001s)]
*  I would like to thank the dedicated public servants of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=72.3s)]
*  We have one set of laws in this country and they apply to everyone. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=78.5s)]
*  And there you have it. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=83.42s)]
*  The special counsel acknowledging the FBI, which defended Trump has attacked and now [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=85.54s)]
*  the new indictment alleges criminally lied to. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=89.52s)]
*  And Jack Smith emphasized one set of laws applies to all. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=92.74s)]
*  He urged people to read the actual charges. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=97.34s)]
*  And I can tell you they dropped today as the ultimate bombshell in this MAGA era. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=99.1s)]
*  You could see journalists, you're not hallucinating, moments ago on your screen, along with lawyers [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=103.7s)]
*  and news junkies and politicos scouring this detailed and damning narrative that has been [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=110.06s)]
*  unfurled today. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=115.02000000000001s)]
*  And we could tell, although this is a breaking and unfolding story, this is a moment for [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=116.94s)]
*  us, for people in America and probably around the world watching, but we can tell already [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=120.38s)]
*  that this has been happening from newsrooms to living rooms. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=125.06s)]
*  And it's a faster process than most cases because Trump's rush to leak his own indictment [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=127.62s)]
*  and his planned arraignment shifted the timeline. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=132.86s)]
*  The DOJ moved to officially unseal the charges that will formally be filed in court next week. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=135.14000000000001s)]
*  And now we have it. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=141.62s)]
*  We can see more than just the number of counts, the 37 being higher than the initial estimates [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=145.02s)]
*  that were leaking out last night. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=149.7s)]
*  We could see the DOJ's view and evidence for what they call the purpose and methods of [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=151.66s)]
*  Trump's criminal conspiracy, the lying, the hiding, the demands to destroy evidence, the [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=157.66s)]
*  pressure on lawyers to join his crimes and the pressure on the lawyers who refused. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=163.46s)]
*  Now, this story has detailed contemporaneous evidence about how Trump basically took his [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=168.46s)]
*  own lawyers and, well, failed to get some of them to commit crimes, which turned them [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=175.46s)]
*  into star witnesses. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=180.58s)]
*  We have more on that later this hour as the DOJ narrates a story of national security [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=182.42000000000002s)]
*  crimes made worse by this cover-up and obstruction plot with new receipts. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=187.06s)]
*  These photos of the contraband, the materials Trump took, secrets carelessly sitting out [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=192.66s)]
*  there on a ballroom stage, quite literally taking center stage. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=198.46s)]
*  We also have the materials that are supposed to be in secured classified rooms instead [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=204.66s)]
*  oddly stacked up to the ceiling in a bathroom. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=209.98s)]
*  You can see our nation's secrets right there next to a Mar-a-Lago toilet. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=213.6s)]
*  Again, just receipts, just facts. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=219.51999999999998s)]
*  Make of it what you will. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=221.92s)]
*  Then spilled documents strewn across the floor. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=224.88s)]
*  Again, all of this building, along with the other testimonial evidence, the case against [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=227.6s)]
*  Trump. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=233.04s)]
*  Some of these photos, as you may have noticed, are new today from the filing. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=234.04s)]
*  There's a lot of incriminating evidence that is brand new. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=236.95999999999998s)]
*  And some of the worst is from Donald Trump's own mouth. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=241.32s)]
*  We were discussing this in our coverage with Rachel and Nicole and the team. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=243.32s)]
*  And this bears repeating right now before I bring in our lawyers, because we have this [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=247.35999999999999s)]
*  now newly revealed tape. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=250.85999999999999s)]
*  There were leaks about it. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=252.35999999999999s)]
*  There were media reports about it. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=253.35999999999999s)]
*  But this ain't no leak. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=254.51999999999998s)]
*  We're talking about the actual transcript of the tape now filed in court, which forms [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=257.28s)]
*  the core of the case against Donald Trump made by Donald Trump. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=263.03999999999996s)]
*  He admits he did not declassify a document that he still held unlawfully, according [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=268.04s)]
*  to DOJ. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=273.32s)]
*  And then on tape, he admits he knows it is too late, saying, quote, see, as president, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=274.68s)]
*  I could have declassified it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=283.92s)]
*  Now I can't. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=287.70000000000005s)]
*  I'm going to read that twice for you, because there's many parts of this filing. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=288.70000000000005s)]
*  But when you are accused of something like this, and your public defense previously was [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=294.3s)]
*  you magically declassified everything, but you're secretly caught on tape saying, quote, [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=298.86s)]
*  see, as president, I could have declassified it. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=303.66s)]
*  Now I can't. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=306.34000000000003s)]
*  You are in a world of hurt. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=308.1s)]
*  Welcome to the legal case, United States versus Donald Trump. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=312.02s)]
*  The defendant is presumed innocent and he has rights, but he is facing a mountain of [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=315.26s)]
*  evidence. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=318.86s)]
*  As promised, we have assembled our lawyers to kick off the coverage on the beat tonight [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=320.2s)]
*  on what is a night in history. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=324.68s)]
*  Kristi Greenberg was former deputy chief of the criminal division at the famed SDNY, and [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=326.52s)]
*  Andrew Weissman served as general counsel at the FBI and was a deputy in the Mueller [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=330.92s)]
*  probe. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=334.8s)]
*  Welcome to both of you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=335.88s)]
*  We have been working together today, so some of this we've discussed. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=337.71999999999997s)]
*  But I want to begin with the tape and what lawyers call admissions against interest, [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=342.0s)]
*  about what in a courtroom drama or a movie would look like a damn, I can't believe he [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=348.96s)]
*  confessed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=354.56s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=355.56s)]
*  So the way I looked at this was first thinking about the seriousness of what was charged [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=356.56s)]
*  in terms of just the level of classification and the level of obstruction. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=363.32s)]
*  But then as a lawyer, I went through it thinking, you know, how is this going to get proved [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=370.0s)]
*  as we used to do when we were in the government? [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=376.0s)]
*  And the detail and the sources from insiders, from employees, from personal lawyers, texts, [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=379.2s)]
*  tape recordings, photographs, none of which can be attacked because all of it is coming [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=389.84s)]
*  from insiders. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=394.6s)]
*  It's not coming from FBI agents who you can say, oh, they're just lying or they planted [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=395.6s)]
*  evidence. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=399.56s)]
*  The tape recording is devastating, although it is not the only devastating piece of evidence. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=401.12s)]
*  And I'll just read to you just from the right after the part where he says, well, I could [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=406.8s)]
*  have declassified it, but I can't. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=412.0s)]
*  So Trump says, now I can't, you know, but this is still a secret. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=415.2s)]
*  And what I love is the staffer response saying, now we have a problem. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=419.8s)]
*  We have a problem. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=424.24s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=425.56s)]
*  The problem, it's like, you know, mission control. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=426.56s)]
*  We have a problem. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=429.16s)]
*  And that is because we now have a classified document in our possession and you knew that [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=430.76000000000005s)]
*  you couldn't do it. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  I know you couldn't do it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=436.20000000000005s)]
*  And now we have it. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=437.72s)]
*  And by the way, it's on tape. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=438.72s)]
*  Right. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=440.36s)]
*  Instead of Houston, we have a problem. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=441.36s)]
*  It's Miami. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=442.36s)]
*  We have a problem. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=443.36s)]
*  Well, and what's so astounding about that transcript is the parts in italics where the [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=444.36s)]
*  staffer is laughing throughout. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=449.84000000000003s)]
*  Like it's just, it's so brazen that they know that these documents, this document is classified [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=452.24s)]
*  and they're laughing about it. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=458.36s)]
*  Oh, I could have declassified it. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=459.48s)]
*  I didn't. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=460.76s)]
*  Ha ha ha. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=461.76s)]
*  Like this is really serious. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=462.76s)]
*  It's a serious document. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=463.76s)]
*  And he also talks about why you get some of the motive in that transcript where he says, [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=465.76s)]
*  well, I totally won my case with this document because General Milley was saying actually, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=471.6s)]
*  you know, it was Trump who wanted to attack Iran and I was trying to stop him. [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=478.04s)]
*  And this document, Trump says, this proves he was wrong. [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=482.08000000000004s)]
*  I win my case. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=484.84000000000003s)]
*  And it just goes back to why was he doing this? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=485.84000000000003s)]
*  And you think like, oh, okay, this is, it's just petty. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=488.64s)]
*  It's just him trying to settle scores with enemies. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=492.08s)]
*  And it just comes across so clearly in that transcript that's quoted in the indictment. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=495.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=500.16s)]
*  What is different about this as well is all of the insider testimony. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=501.16s)]
*  And this is something that's jumped out from the beginning. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=506.04s)]
*  Andrew and I were looking at the breadcrumbs of the clues leading to this. [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=507.8s)]
*  We knew that Trump had lost lawyers. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=512.32s)]
*  He lost two more today. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=514.2s)]
*  We knew that the New York Times busted open this story that one of the lawyers on this [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=516.28s)]
*  very case was making tapes to try to protect it would appear himself. [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=519.64s)]
*  So I want to walk through some of this right now with both of you and for the viewers who [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=523.8399999999999s)]
*  may have seen some of this on your phone or some of the MSNBC coverage here on The Beat. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=528.04s)]
*  We want to show you how these reliable sources that Jack Smith is using are the kind of sources [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=531.04s)]
*  most defendants would shudder to see in an indictment. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=536.88s)]
*  The lawyers are here because Trump's own lawyers are dropping a dime. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=539.3199999999999s)]
*  We see references to Trump attorney one which appears to be Evan Corker and the lawyer that [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=544.32s)]
*  just last night on The Beat we reported on how his emerging role was a star witness that [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=547.84s)]
*  might amount to a John Dean or a Don McGahn. [[00:09:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=552.24s)]
*  You have Trump saying I don't want anybody looking through my boxes. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=555.08s)]
*  I don't want you looking through them. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=558.28s)]
*  What if we what happens if we just don't respond at all or don't play ball with the feds. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=560.0600000000001s)]
*  These are the feds who have now indicted him. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=565.04s)]
*  Quote wouldn't it be better if we just told them we don't have anything here which is [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=566.96s)]
*  of course a lie. [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=570.88s)]
*  We now know. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=571.88s)]
*  Isn't it better if there are no documents again from the lawyer. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=573.64s)]
*  That is an estimation of what Trump said at the time saying well wouldn't it be better [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=578.2s)]
*  if we lied and said there are no documents when there are and we know that he is now [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=583.56s)]
*  charged with the false statement lie. [[00:09:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=587.48s)]
*  And then you have this thing we've been talking about today the plucking motion that was Donald [[00:09:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=590.68s)]
*  Trump trying to persuade or cajole or illegally demand his lawyers just pluck out the bad [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=594.72s)]
*  stuff. [[00:10:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=600.04s)]
*  The lawyer says he made kind of a funny motion like well OK why don't you take them these [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=601.1999999999999s)]
*  secret documents to your hotel room and if there's anything really bad in there pluck [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=605.24s)]
*  it out. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=608.64s)]
*  And he made that motion. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=609.64s)]
*  He didn't say that the lawyer explains. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=611.12s)]
*  Now we were discussing this earlier in our breaking coverage on these breaking news days [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=613.9599999999999s)]
*  we're all doing the shift work as you may have noticed and we were discussing earlier [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=616.9599999999999s)]
*  today something that now I want to play in its original format. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=620.9599999999999s)]
*  Shout out to breaking bad because there is a moment where you say do I need a lawyer [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=624.28s)]
*  to defend what I've done in the past and you have every right to that or are you a stone [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=629.28s)]
*  cold criminal who's looking for a criminal lawyer who's not a criminal defense lawyer [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=633.54s)]
*  but a lawyer will be a criminal. [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=637.56s)]
*  It's something that overlaps with the new indictment because what you're about to see [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=639.0s)]
*  is exactly what DOJ thinks Donald Trump was looking for. [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=643.4s)]
*  You don't want a criminal lawyer. [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=649.68s)]
*  You want a criminal lawyer. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=651.6s)]
*  Andrew. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=655.8399999999999s)]
*  So that is that is exactly what is recorded by clearly Evan Corcoran. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=657.52s)]
*  They managed to get a court order that said that Evan Corcoran has to testify that he [[00:11:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=665.96s)]
*  has to turn over his notes. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=671.36s)]
*  It turns out his notes were quite extensive because he had made tape recordings of essentially [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=672.8000000000001s)]
*  recording everything that he would call if he could recall that happened. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=678.08s)]
*  That's what come. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=681.72s)]
*  This is so detailed. [[00:11:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=682.72s)]
*  You basically have Donald Trump saying first with respect to the subpoena this all goes [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=684.34s)]
*  to the obstruction. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=688.74s)]
*  Why can't we just say that we've returned everything as you pointed out. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=689.74s)]
*  That's a lie. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=693.46s)]
*  He then goes on to say essentially you know why don't you just do what the lawyer for [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=694.9399999999999s)]
*  Hillary Clinton does. [[00:11:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=699.66s)]
*  By the way that's not what the lawyer for Hillary Clinton does but that's what he that's [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=701.02s)]
*  what Trump thinks it is. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=703.86s)]
*  And it's like can't you just get rid of these doctors destroy the evidence destroy it for [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=704.86s)]
*  me but you do it because then I won't get in trouble. [[00:11:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=709.18s)]
*  When will federal defendant Donald Trump go on trial. [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=714.66s)]
*  Special counsel Smith unsealed that indictment today and vowed a speedy trial. [[00:11:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=718.9399999999999s)]
*  My office will seek a speedy trial in this matter consistent with the public interest [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=724.74s)]
*  and the rights of the accused. [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=729.56s)]
*  Speed seems to be important to him. [[00:12:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=732.78s)]
*  The indictment came just seven months after Smith took over this post when Attorney General [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=735.22s)]
*  Garland appointed him. [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=739.24s)]
*  Today I signed an order appointing Jack Smith to serve as special counsel. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=742.5400000000001s)]
*  The extraordinary circumstances presented here demanded Mr. Smith is the right choice [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=747.74s)]
*  to complete these matters in an even handed and urgent manner. [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=754.46s)]
*  There you have it. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=759.5400000000001s)]
*  It hits a little different now with everything we know today Garland tapped a prosecutor that [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=762.46s)]
*  he knew had experience including prosecuting corruption cases against politicians including [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=766.7800000000001s)]
*  Democrat John Edwards and heads of state. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=771.42s)]
*  Smith served as a tough war crimes prosecutor at the Hague where he faced down a sitting [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=774.42s)]
*  foreign president's efforts to obstruct and undermine him. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=778.3s)]
*  Now Smith was certainly not very famous across America but Garland clearly viewed him as [[00:13:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=781.34s)]
*  someone who would fearlessly follow the facts. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=787.02s)]
*  One colleague recounts that Jack Smith doesn't like to sit there playing with his food. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=790.6s)]
*  A phrase that refers to getting the job done or as Sean Carter memorably put it I check [[00:13:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=797.34s)]
*  cheddar like a food inspector. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=802.98s)]
*  My homie always told me finish your breakfast. [[00:13:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=805.1s)]
*  Today Smith's showing he is finishing this meal if you will and not playing with his [[00:13:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=808.8199999999999s)]
*  food. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=813.9s)]
*  If you want proof look no further than the very end of today's filing where history [[00:13:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=814.9s)]
*  is made and Smith quite literally swears and signs his name to getting the ultimate job [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=819.9399999999999s)]
*  done. [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=826.58s)]
*  As promised we add to our panel Mya Wiley is here back with Andrew Weissman. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=828.1s)]
*  Don't play with your food finish your breakfast get the job done many ways to say it. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=833.4399999999999s)]
*  What did we learn about Jack Smith today? [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=838.5s)]
*  Jack Smith don't play. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=840.8199999999999s)]
*  That's it that's all I got to say. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=841.8199999999999s)]
*  Look first of all did you see his face? [[00:14:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=844.8199999999999s)]
*  I don't know Jack Smith but I don't want to be on the other side of a table from Jack [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=848.9399999999999s)]
*  Smith. [[00:14:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=852.7s)]
*  Can I just say you know she's a really nice guy. [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=853.7s)]
*  I don't care. [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=855.7800000000001s)]
*  Yeah we're not talking about his off hours we're talking about his on hours. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=856.7800000000001s)]
*  We're not talking about when he's eating at the restaurant. [[00:14:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=859.58s)]
*  We're talking about when he's. [[00:14:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=861.7800000000001s)]
*  No but. [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=863.7800000000001s)]
*  You're probably right he's all business. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=864.7800000000001s)]
*  That's my point he's all business he's all focus. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=865.7800000000001s)]
*  He made it very clear you talked about I think what he does he set the table the meal's about [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=868.86s)]
*  to get eaten and Donald Trump's on the plate. [[00:14:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=875.38s)]
*  And Donald Trump is going to be cooked. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=878.7800000000001s)]
*  Again I like to say he's legally presumed innocent and will afford him his defenses. [[00:14:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=881.86s)]
*  We had Tim Pallatore on this show recently who departed this team on the classified documents [[00:14:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=885.62s)]
*  case he made several arguments including well maybe all the bad stuff Trump said was a lie. [[00:14:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=890.38s)]
*  The other thing I think we see Maya is that Jack Smith was clearly and I say this with [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=895.7s)]
*  regard to what the DOJ must do which is be reasonable he was clearly open to an off ramp. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=901.5s)]
*  Had there been full cooperation even with the documents there it seemed earlier on they [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=907.46s)]
*  didn't rush to search. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=912.4200000000001s)]
*  They had contact with the federal side that's all the paperwork stuff and then the lawyers [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=914.62s)]
*  but when Donald Trump basically thought what are they going to do search my home and indict [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=919.7s)]
*  me it seems that Smith had no problem going down that road if he needed to. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=925.5400000000001s)]
*  Well yeah and he went down it pretty quickly once he was appointed I mean I think that's [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6zLDsp5Q6A&t=931.22s)]
