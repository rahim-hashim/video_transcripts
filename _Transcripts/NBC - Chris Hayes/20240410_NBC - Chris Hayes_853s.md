# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 9
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes and we are a week out from the first criminal trial of an ex-president in American history. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump is doing everything in his power to prevent it from happening. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=7.0s)]
*  Today, he lost before a New York appellate court after he tried to argue that his hush money election interference case should be delayed pending his appeal of his gag order in the same case. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=12.0s)]
*  That's a gag order that was issued by the judge because Trump cannot stop making threatening and inflammatory statements about people involved in his legal cases, including, in this case, the judge's own daughter. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=23.0s)]
*  Trump also lost a separate appeal to get the case delayed yesterday. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=35.0s)]
*  A different New York judge declined to postpone the case while Trump tries to get it moved out of Manhattan to a more favorable jurisdiction. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=40.0s)]
*  This all comes after he lost yet another appeal for delay last week, which was partially related to his claims of presidential immunity. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=47.0s)]
*  Of course, the payments at hand happened before he was president, or at least they were agreed to before he was president. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=54.0s)]
*  He bribed an adult film actress to cover up an extramarital affair they had while his wife was at home taking care of their four-month-old son. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=60.0s)]
*  And here's the thing. Donald Trump is incredibly litigious. He has spent his entire career in and out of court. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=67.0s)]
*  In fact, the only thing he seems to enjoy more than suing people is threatening to sue people. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=75.0s)]
*  Every woman lied when they came forward to hurt my campaign. Total fabrication. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=80.0s)]
*  The events never happened. Never. All of these liars will be sued after the election is over. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=92.0s)]
*  I've never seen anybody that lied as much as Ted Cruz. He doesn't even have the right to serve as president or even run as president. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=101.0s)]
*  He was born in Canada. So I will bring that lawsuit if he doesn't apologize. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=111.0s)]
*  They're spending hundreds of millions of dollars on false commercials and it's a disgrace. So what we'll do, I guess we'll sue them. Let's sue them, right? Let's sue them. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=114.0s)]
*  Can you go four years without threatening to sue anybody? [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=124.0s)]
*  It's also a tactic for me. It's a business for me and I've been successful and I've, you know, used litigation and sometimes I use it maybe when I shouldn't and sometimes I don't. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=126.0s)]
*  In the past, I think it's fair to say the ex-president was not afraid of a protracted legal battle. He seemed to relish them. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=137.0s)]
*  And if you ask him and the people around him, they all insist right now that he is just chomping at the bit, ready for a fight in this New York case. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=143.0s)]
*  And he got into a, you know, a typical Donald Trump posture where he's ready to be combative on something that he believes is an injustice. [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=152.0s)]
*  His knees don't buckle Savannah. So I think he's now in the posture that he's ready to fight this. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=161.0s)]
*  This is an all out war, an all out war. Donald Trump is the toughest human being I've ever met. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=166.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. Here's the thing. If you actually look at Donald Trump's actions, he is not standing at the courthouse door saying, bring it on. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=172.0s)]
*  He is clearly desperate to avoid going to trial. I mean, he is truly throwing everything to the wall, see what will stick. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=184.0s)]
*  There's one really good reason why he is trying so desperately to wriggle out of this trial, which is that the government has a very good case against him. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=193.0s)]
*  And the reason we know the government has a very good case is because the issue at hand here, the facts of the charges have already resulted in someone going to jail. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=201.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen was the one, the intermediary, who pulled off the scheme of structuring these very payments to Stormy Daniels. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=212.0s)]
*  Prosecutors under the Trump administration, Trump's Justice Department, said it was illegal and illegal in a way to benefit Trump's campaign. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=220.0s)]
*  It benefited Trump's campaign specifically because the payments came right after the news of the Access Hollywood tape broke. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=230.0s)]
*  And if you remember, Trump was the weakest he had ever been as a candidate. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=237.0s)]
*  One more scandal, like say a secret affair with a porn star while his wife was taking care of their four month old newborn. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=241.0s)]
*  What a very likely end to his campaign, one of the great counterfactuals of American history. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=248.0s)]
*  So what happened? Trump had Michael Cohen interfere in the election by paying Stormy Daniels to stay quiet. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=253.0s)]
*  Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to those charges and others. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=258.0s)]
*  He went to prison for over a year before securing home confinement during the COVID pandemic. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=261.0s)]
*  Again, this is all just like on the record. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=266.0s)]
*  This is all established. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=269.0s)]
*  For all of Trump's gravity defying, improbable, case from accountability. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=272.0s)]
*  And believe me, having covered him for a while now, there have been many, legal or otherwise. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=279.0s)]
*  You know, somewhere deep down, he is just a scared 77 year old man. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=284.0s)]
*  You know, toughest guy I've ever met, notwithstanding. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=289.0s)]
*  He's also someone that has watched a whole bunch of people in his orbit go to actual prison or jail. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=293.0s)]
*  Like really doing it. Michael Cohen, Paul Manafort, Alan Weisselberg, his accountants worked with for decades. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=299.0s)]
*  Peter Navarro, George Papadopoulos, Rick Gates. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=306.0s)]
*  Trump doesn't want to join those ranks. Just ask Michael Cohen. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=309.0s)]
*  He could at the end of that line potentially, he's legally presumed innocent. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=314.0s)]
*  He could end up in prison based on your long years of service with him. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=317.0s)]
*  How will he process that? [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=323.0s)]
*  Very poorly. You know, as I like to call him sometimes in my tweets, diaper Donald will be filling up that diaper. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=325.0s)]
*  Because he, this is not something that Donald is capable of either understanding or contending with. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=332.0s)]
*  He, as you stated accurately, he believes he could control every situation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=340.0s)]
*  This is not a situation that he has any control over. And that's making him sick to his stomach. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=346.0s)]
*  And you think he'll feel genuine fear? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=352.0s)]
*  Yes. I think right now he's beyond petrified. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=354.0s)]
*  Underneath all the bravado is an elderly man who is genuinely facing the possibility of the same fate of so many of his associates. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=357.0s)]
*  Time behind bars. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=365.0s)]
*  The brand new law of the land in the state of Arizona banning nearly all abortions was put into effect in the olden times. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=367.0s)]
*  1864 when this ban first went on the books, Arizona wasn't even a state. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=375.0s)]
*  In fact, it had just become a territory of the United States one year prior. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=379.0s)]
*  The population of the entire area, which included part of what is now Nevada, was less than 10,000 people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=384.0s)]
*  Less than 250 people lived in Phoenix. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=390.0s)]
*  There were at least three times as many cattle in the territory as there were people. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=393.0s)]
*  In 1864, America was made up of just 36 states. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=398.0s)]
*  There was no state of Nebraska or Colorado, Washington, Oklahoma, certainly no Alaska or Hawaii. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=401.0s)]
*  Arizona would not be admitted to the Union for almost 50 years. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=406.0s)]
*  We were, of course, still in the midst of the Civil War. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=410.0s)]
*  Abraham Lincoln was president and he had just signed the Emancipation Procumlation. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=412.0s)]
*  The slavery remained legal, would for another year until the 13th Amendment was ratified. [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=416.0s)]
*  Of course, African Americans could not vote. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=421.0s)]
*  Women could not vote. It took 56 more years for that to change. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=423.0s)]
*  In 1864, we didn't have light bulbs. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=427.0s)]
*  Indoor plumbing was new and rare. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=430.0s)]
*  The number one movie was, well, nothing, obviously. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=432.0s)]
*  There were no movies. Radio was still decades away. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=434.0s)]
*  But in 1864, Arizona convened its very first territorial legislature and passed a near total ban on abortion. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=437.0s)]
*  It was codified in 1901 and again in 1913 after Arizona became a state. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=446.0s)]
*  Today, the state Supreme Court upheld that very same law, turning back the clock 160 years for women in Arizona. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=452.0s)]
*  Joining me now is Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays, who has said that she will not prosecute any women or doctors under this law. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=461.0s)]
*  It's good to have you. [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=469.0s)]
*  Let me just start with a legal question because I think a lot of people are confused. [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=470.0s)]
*  How is it possible to unfreeze a law from 1864 and have it be the law of the land? [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=476.0s)]
*  What was the question before the Supreme Court and what position did your office take? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=482.0s)]
*  Right, Chris. Well, thanks for having me. [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=487.0s)]
*  And the legal question was really whether the 1864 territorial total abortion ban, with no exceptions for rape or incest, [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=490.0s)]
*  took precedent or was the law that the Supreme Court should choose over a much more recently adopted 15 week ban, [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=501.0s)]
*  much more recently as in this century, a few years ago, the legislature passed that ban. [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=514.0s)]
*  We were obviously arguing the 15 week ban, though it is imperfect and had no exceptions for rape or incest, [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=520.0s)]
*  should be implemented if you're going to have to implement an abortion ban over in 1864 law. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=529.0s)]
*  Unfortunately, this Supreme Court, dominated by pretty extreme justices, it looks like, chose 1864. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=537.0s)]
*  So what does this mean now for the residents of your state? [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=548.0s)]
*  Look, Chris, this is an existential crisis for our residents. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=555.0s)]
*  And I think, you know, millions of Arizonans, men and women, Republicans, Democrats, [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=561.0s)]
*  independents woke up this morning to a decision that drags us back to 1864. [[00:09:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=568.0s)]
*  And, you know, though I have said I will not prosecute anyone under this draconian law, [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=575.0s)]
*  we obviously know that it's going to have a chilling effect on reproductive access, reproductive health care access, on abortion access. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=584.0s)]
*  And I've already had attorneys general from other states reach out to me to offer their help and had the vice president of the United States [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=594.0s)]
*  reach out to me today to offer her help. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=604.0s)]
*  This is a crisis for our state and it's chaotic, to be honest with you. [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=608.0s)]
*  But we're going to continue to fight this decision by the Supreme Court. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=614.0s)]
*  We're going to do everything that I can as AG. [[00:10:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=618.0s)]
*  And everything is on the table. [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=621.0s)]
*  Nothing is off the table. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=624.0s)]
*  We're going to continue to fight this in the courts wherever we can. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=626.0s)]
*  And we're going to try to help women. [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=630.0s)]
*  In the period basically, Chris, between now and when Arizona will have a ballot initiative on the ballot in November that I believe [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=632.0s)]
*  will allow Arizonans to enshrine reproductive rights and abortion access in our Constitution. [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=642.0s)]
*  Yeah, I was just going to talk about the possibility of a remedy polling that we have. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=650.0s)]
*  I think the state's 2020-23 polling out of Arizona State had 62% of Arizonans saying abortion should always be legal with no restrictions [[00:10:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=654.0s)]
*  or legal with some minor restrictions. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=662.0s)]
*  I would imagine there will be some polling this week and I would bet that number is probably even higher. [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=664.0s)]
*  There is going to be a ballot initiative in the state and that would override this decision, right? [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=669.0s)]
*  Is it a state constitutional amendment? [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=675.0s)]
*  Absolutely. [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=680.0s)]
*  It's a constitutional amendment and it would override this decision. [[00:11:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=681.0s)]
*  And I really think, obviously, this is a terrible, terrible decision coming out of the Supreme Court here. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=686.0s)]
*  But this is a political earthquake that I think extreme Republicans are going to regret. [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=694.0s)]
*  They're going to regret this. [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=701.0s)]
*  Come November, I believe that ballot initiative is going to pass. [[00:11:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=703.0s)]
*  I believe Arizonans are resoundingly going to make it clear that they don't want to be dragged back to 1864. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=707.0s)]
*  I believe it makes it very possible that our legislature would be flipped to Democratic. [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=715.0s)]
*  And certainly Ruben Gallego, who is running for the United States Senate, could benefit from this as well, as could Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=721.0s)]
*  Yeah, I should note that the president put this statement out today. [[00:12:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=730.0s)]
*  Millions of Arizonans will soon live under an even more extreme and dangerous abortion ban, [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=733.0s)]
*  which fails to protect women even when their health is at risk or in tragic case of rape or incest. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=737.0s)]
*  The ruling is a result of the extreme agenda of Republican elected officials who are committed to ripping away women's freedom. [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=742.0s)]
*  Obviously, this is going to be an acute crisis, though, in the next few months. [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=749.0s)]
*  You said everything's on the table, but I've got to imagine, I mean, you know, this is now, I think, the most extreme ban in the country, right? [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=752.0s)]
*  It has to be. [[00:12:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=760.0s)]
*  I think it probably is, Chris. [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=761.0s)]
*  And that's why, you know, I'm going to be in communication with my colleagues, my colleagues around Arizona, California, New Mexico, Colorado, Nevada, [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=764.0s)]
*  to see what we can do with our partner states to help women who probably are going to have to flee Arizona in the next few months. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=776.0s)]
*  There'll be about a 45 to 60 days stay in this decision, we believe, due to another court case. [[00:13:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=787.0s)]
*  But we're still going to have this period where abortion care could come to almost a total halt. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=795.0s)]
*  And so we're going to need our surrounding states to take in women who need reproductive care. [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=804.0s)]
*  Truly shocking to my mind, appalling decision out of out of your state today. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=811.0s)]
*  Arizona Attorney General Chris Mays, thank you so much for spending some time with us tonight. [[00:13:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=816.0s)]
*  MSNBC. You click on the MSNBC app. You click on get or the cloud icon and enjoy it. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-15XKZdDJic&t=841.0s)]
