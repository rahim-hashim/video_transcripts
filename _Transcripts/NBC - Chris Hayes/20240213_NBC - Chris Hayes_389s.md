# ‘Trump is losing it’: New scrutiny on Trump’s ‘gibberish’ at campaign rallies
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA)
*  Donald Trump has sort of been decomposing in front of our eyes for so long it's hard [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=0.0s)]
*  to track the trajectory. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=5.32s)]
*  I mean, he is after all the guy who talked about shining UV light inside people's orifices [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=6.32s)]
*  or alternately injecting bleach in order to cure them of COVID. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=12.64s)]
*  He said that in public from the White House podium. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=16.6s)]
*  I rewatched that clip today and it drove home to me how all the stupidity, insanity, hostility [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=19.48s)]
*  of Donald Trump's term has been kind of sanded down to just goofy in a lot of people's remembrances. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=24.64s)]
*  Today, in a column titled Trump is Losing It, New York Times opinion columnist Jamele Bowie [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=30.560000000000002s)]
*  compared Trump's feebleness to the breathless coverage of President Biden's age. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=35.28s)]
*  Quote, Biden may be unable to do the job at some point in the future. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=38.96s)]
*  Trump, it seems to me, already is. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=42.32s)]
*  One of those is a lot more concerning than the other. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=44.2s)]
*  And Jamele Bowie, New York Times opinion columnist joins me now. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=46.84s)]
*  Jamele, I liked your column and one of the things, and this is a hobby horse of mine, [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=50.08s)]
*  so I'll just ride it for a moment, which is I do think that because people don't see him [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=53.56s)]
*  speak at length extemporaneously much anymore, they've lost sight of just how completely [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=58.32s)]
*  incoherent he sounds when he does. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=65.28s)]
*  No, I think that's right. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=68.08s)]
*  I think Trump's great, one of the great political advantages is that when he's out of public view, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=68.96000000000001s)]
*  people just sort of like forget about him and everything they don't like about him is sort of [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=73.92s)]
*  not in their face. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=78.4s)]
*  But if you just watch his recent appearances at rallies, at public events and such, [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=80.16s)]
*  he's incoherent. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=87.27999999999999s)]
*  I believe it's something to call him. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=89.03999999999999s)]
*  He speaks in gibberish and it's very striking to watch. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=90.47999999999999s)]
*  Yeah, say more about that because he's always been sort of one for tangents, but it is notably [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  harder to make your way through the logic of what he is saying than it was even a few years ago, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=103.83999999999999s)]
*  I find. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=109.52s)]
*  I agree. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=111.52s)]
*  There's one clip I watched of him attempting to explain a missile defense system, and he goes [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=112.4s)]
*  from sort of like a relatively cogent sort of like, you know, we build these things for other [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=117.92s)]
*  countries into what took me a sec to really figure out what he was saying, like a description of how [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=123.2s)]
*  it works, but in sort of the kind of elliptical nonsensical Trump fashion. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=127.92s)]
*  It was very strange to watch. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=134.0s)]
*  And I imagine, I've been to my fair share of Trump rallies, I imagine that in the moment, [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=135.68s)]
*  especially if you're there as a supporter, it kind of just flies over you. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=140.4s)]
*  But I have to imagine that someone who just doesn't really think much about Trump and you [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=144.56s)]
*  just plopped them right there and you said, try to make sense of this, it would be hard. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=148.96s)]
*  And certainly, if the current president were speaking in that manner, it would be a legitimate [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=153.76s)]
*  scandal. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=159.92000000000002s)]
*  There's also the fact that, again, there's always been a certain amount of incoherence baked in, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=161.44s)]
*  that it can be, it's hard to gauge over time. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=166.48000000000002s)]
*  I mean, part of this because, I mean, look, when you look at Donald Trump from the 1990s, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=168.8s)]
*  it's clear, right, that he's aged considerably. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=173.28s)]
*  And that same is true of Joe Biden. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=175.44s)]
*  When you look at Joe Biden as a senator, you know, when he's 40 or 45, like he's much younger [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=176.8s)]
*  man and he speaks very differently considerably. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=181.04000000000002s)]
*  But Trump saying nonsense and incoherent things has been such a, again, it's like so many things [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=184.32000000000002s)]
*  about him that seems baked in and thus unremarkable and then thus not a news story. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=191.60000000000002s)]
*  Yeah, I don't know. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=196.24s)]
*  That's a real dynamic, that is the dynamic. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=199.76000000000002s)]
*  And I find it troubling because, as you mentioned earlier, he was president. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=202.24s)]
*  Yes. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=206.56s)]
*  And it seems so strange to me that he is discussed, so much coverage of him talks, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=207.04000000000002s)]
*  like essentially speculation. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=213.12s)]
*  But no, he was president of the United States for four years. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=215.12s)]
*  I remember it, I saw it. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=218.08s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=219.20000000000002s)]
*  And his NATO riff over the weekend, that would be troubling even for just a candidate. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=220.4s)]
*  But he was president and he should know. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=229.28s)]
*  And treating it as if it's like, oh, that's just Trump doing his thing. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=231.84s)]
*  My view is, no, that's not just Trump doing his thing. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=237.04000000000002s)]
*  That's the former president of the United States demonstrating, not even that he has [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=239.52s)]
*  like a difference of opinion with regards to NATO, but they doesn't understand what [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=244.4s)]
*  the thing is. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=248.56s)]
*  Yes. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=250.4s)]
*  I think at many basic levels, he does not understand the most big things of health [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=250.96s)]
*  insurance, what Medicare is, the difference between Medicare and Medicaid, like basic [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=255.92000000000002s)]
*  things that you would expect a president. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=260.0s)]
*  But we also saw, I mean, to me, the big thing that we've blocked out is COVID. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=262.08s)]
*  Because we saw how that lack of knowledge, curiosity, that incoherence all came together [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=267.04s)]
*  in the response, in the ludicrous things from the saying from the White House, the inability [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=273.44s)]
*  to actually process and make decisions about new information to a tangible effect in terms [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=280.16s)]
*  of how bad the response was. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=287.04s)]
*  And again, that was where it all happened and it all happened before us. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=288.48s)]
*  But I do think people have blocked it out. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=291.76s)]
*  Trump has gotten some kind of COVID mulligan that, oh, that's just, who could have predicted [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=294.96000000000004s)]
*  the pandemic? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=299.52s)]
*  But here's the thing. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=300.24s)]
*  The job of the presidency is being prepared for crises. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=302.8s)]
*  That's all it is. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=307.76s)]
*  We judge presidents historically over how they handle crises. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=309.2s)]
*  As you know, I'm someone who's very interested in 19th century history. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=313.44s)]
*  The reason we think of James Buchanan as a failed president, because he was met with [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=316.48s)]
*  a crisis, mounting secession talk, and he failed to handle it or deal with it in a way [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=320.56s)]
*  that helped the country survive. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=326.88s)]
*  Donald Trump faced a crisis and that's the job and he failed to handle it. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=328.8s)]
*  And so it's strange that so many Americans and I think a lot of coverage has given him [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=334.56s)]
*  a mulligan as if it doesn't count. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=341.44s)]
*  No, this is precisely the thing that counts the most. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=343.04s)]
*  I could not agree more about this. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=345.76s)]
*  A recurring theme we actually talked about on my podcast, Why is this Happening this [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=348.0s)]
*  Week with Eric Kleinenberg, who's got a new book out about that year, about 2020, revisiting [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=352.24s)]
*  it, which again, people have locked out for totally understandable reasons of emotional [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=357.6s)]
*  health. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=361.84000000000003s)]
*  But speaking to that mulligan, I think it's really important to re-examine Jamal Bowie. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=362.56s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fx9DANFmZtA&t=367.84000000000003s)]
