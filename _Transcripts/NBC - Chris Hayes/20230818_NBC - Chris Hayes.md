# ‘Rare and historic’ California under first-ever tropical storm watch
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4)
*  So we are living through the hottest summer, not just of our lifetimes, probably the last [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=0.0s)]
*  100,000 years or so, at best as we can tell. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=4.0s)]
*  And every day brings some new near biblical level event. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=6.62s)]
*  We just had the Maui fires last week, devastating. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=9.38s)]
*  People there are currently dealing with the immediate aftermath, trying to recover. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=12.48s)]
*  They're going to be trying to recover for a long time. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=15.5s)]
*  Now California is under its first tropical storm watch ever, with a category four hurricane [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=18.3s)]
*  headed towards Los Angeles, of all places. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=25.66s)]
*  A thing that, in all honesty, I had no idea could happen. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=28.26s)]
*  In fact, until about 24 hours ago, as someone who, you know, covers this stuff from time [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=31.8s)]
*  to time, it was my strong understanding that there were typhoons in the Pacific that went [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=36.120000000000005s)]
*  from east to west and crashed into places like Philippines and Japan, and that there [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=39.38s)]
*  were hurricanes in the Atlantic that also went from east to west and would make land [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=43.46s)]
*  fall in Florida or the Gulf Coast or up the eastern seaboard. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=46.879999999999995s)]
*  I didn't know there was such a thing as a hurricane that could hit Southern California. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=49.7s)]
*  That appears to be about to happen. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=55.78s)]
*  Right now Hurricane Hillary is a category four storm. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=58.34s)]
*  It's about 300 miles south-southwest of Cabo San Lucas, winds topping out at 130 miles [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=61.06s)]
*  per hour. [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=66.66s)]
*  This is the projected path. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=68.3s)]
*  It could hit LA sometime on Sunday. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=69.46000000000001s)]
*  The wind speed could hopefully drop below hurricane status. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=73.18s)]
*  At least that's what we think as of now. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=76.66s)]
*  Paul Douglas is a senior meteorologist at Predictix, as well as a weather columnist [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=79.58s)]
*  from Minnesota's Star Tribune, and he joins me now. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=83.74s)]
*  First, I guess, Paul, like what what how is this happening? [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  I'm not wrong that this doesn't generally happen, shouldn't be happening. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=92.06s)]
*  It is surreal, even for a meteorologist. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=97.3s)]
*  I mean, usually the water temperatures in the Pacific are too chilly to support [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=100.46s)]
*  tropical systems. Hurricanes, the warmer the water, the greater the potential for [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=106.58s)]
*  intensification. But with upwelling trade winds coming in, west winds coming in [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=111.46s)]
*  off the Pacific, it usually brings the colder water to the surface off the coast [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=116.97999999999999s)]
*  of L.A. And that that really prevents these storms from intensifying. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=122.33999999999999s)]
*  But as you just mentioned, water temperatures worldwide off the scale, air [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=127.89999999999999s)]
*  temperatures this summer have been off the scale. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=133.94s)]
*  Antarctic sea ice loss off the scale. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=136.85999999999999s)]
*  All these things. And we have a developing El Nino. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=140.98s)]
*  So the water is unusually warm right now, Alpaca, Mexico. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=143.62s)]
*  And this thing is a big deal. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=147.38s)]
*  And it's going to come ashore probably near Tijuana or San Diego as a strong [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=149.26s)]
*  tropical storm winds 50, 60, 70 miles an hour, at least in gusts. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=154.5s)]
*  The primary threat, though, Chris, is going to be biblical rain. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=160.29999999999998s)]
*  Five, 10 inches, Palm Springs east of San Diego. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=163.9s)]
*  Some of the eastern suburbs now of Los Angeles under a high threat of extreme [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=169.06s)]
*  flooding, including Riverside, San Bernardino, the Inland Empire, three, [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=174.54s)]
*  three and a half million people under the gun. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=179.38s)]
*  And the primary concern is midday Sunday to midday Monday when the flooding [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=181.85999999999999s)]
*  threat is going to be off the scale. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=187.26s)]
*  Some flooding in downtown L.A. and San Diego. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=189.01999999999998s)]
*  I think the worst of it staying just east, but Las Vegas could also see five, [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=192.01999999999998s)]
*  six, eight inches of rain, one to two years worth of rain, Chris, in one to two days. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=197.17999999999998s)]
*  That's going to cause problems. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=203.06s)]
*  Yeah, that's what you know, one again, one of the things that I've been learning, [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=205.33999999999997s)]
*  covering all this and again, you sort of learning every day because new stuff is [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=208.29999999999998s)]
*  happening is just we saw this hurricane Harvey in Houston and how brutal that, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=212.5s)]
*  you know, it wasn't the wind there. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=217.54s)]
*  It was the it was the amount of water dumped into that metro area and what and [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=218.9s)]
*  what that did. And we just see it in other places where, you know, if enough [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=222.94000000000003s)]
*  rain falls, right, it just can't be absorbed. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=227.70000000000002s)]
*  It's got to all go somewhere. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=229.70000000000002s)]
*  I got to imagine not an expert on this, but in a place like Death Valley or the [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=231.54000000000002s)]
*  desert in, you know, around the Inland Empire, right, east of L.A., that whole [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=235.3s)]
*  strip of what is literal desert, the ground. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=238.58s)]
*  I mean, I just don't know how like how does that work? [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=243.22000000000003s)]
*  What happens to that environment if you dump six inches of water in, you know, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=246.06s)]
*  24 hours? [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=250.98000000000002s)]
*  It immediately almost immediately runs off. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=252.66000000000003s)]
*  It's not like the nice topsoil we get east of the Rockies. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=255.5s)]
*  It's very hard, compacted sand and it doesn't absorb the water. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=259.58s)]
*  So the water runs off. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=265.78000000000003s)]
*  And I have friends in Palm Springs, the Coachella Valley, the mountains east of [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=267.7s)]
*  San Diego, beautiful area. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=271.70000000000005s)]
*  But again, they are in for some of the worst flooding that area has ever seen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=273.90000000000003s)]
*  And the storm is lifting northward towards Las Vegas, eventually into Wyoming [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=279.02000000000004s)]
*  and Idaho. There could be significant flooding there. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=284.1s)]
*  But I never thought in a million years, Chris, that the first state to be [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=287.18s)]
*  impacted by a tropical system would not be Florida or Texas or Louisiana. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=292.06s)]
*  It's California. It's just mind blowing. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=297.18s)]
*  And I think a lot of meteorologists feel the same way. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=300.7s)]
*  Yeah, let's go. So let's go back to circle back to that original point you make, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=304.21999999999997s)]
*  because I just want to make sure I'm parsing it. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=307.34s)]
*  So the Atlantic tends to be warmer than the Pacific, my understanding is, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=308.74s)]
*  and that that band of warm water is where those tropical storms develop. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=312.7s)]
*  They go east to west. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=317.18s)]
*  And then depending on what happens, they'll go into the Gulf. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=318.21999999999997s)]
*  They'll hit Florida, the Gulf, the eastern seaboard. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=320.58s)]
*  The way that that water temperatures in the Pacific work and the trade [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=322.74s)]
*  work, it just usually isn't hot enough to support the storm. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=328.02s)]
*  Basically, the heat is what's bringing the energy. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=330.3s)]
*  And so in this case, we've got we've got an ocean that's off the scale. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=332.5s)]
*  I mean, it's the warmest the world's oceans ever been. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=336.26s)]
*  And that's really the like root but for a cause of why we're getting this. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=339.06s)]
*  That's the gasoline being poured on the flames right now. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=344.1s)]
*  Unusually warm water in the equatorial Pacific. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=347.86s)]
*  You really have a combination of factors. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=351.1s)]
*  It's not just one thing. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=353.18s)]
*  It's a developing El Nino could be a super. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=354.90000000000003s)]
*  The biggest since 97, 98, that one stain of water in the equatorial Pacific. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=358.34000000000003s)]
*  You also have one right next to CO2 and methane contributing to the warming. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=364.06s)]
*  And all of these factors are enabling this storm to become a major hurricane. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=370.58000000000004s)]
*  And it probably is going to strike as a tropical storm, not a hurricane. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=376.58000000000004s)]
*  But this is going to be a big deal for Southern California, possibly right on up to Las Vegas. [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=381.14s)]
*  Again, midday Sunday through midday Monday. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=387.46s)]
*  A lot of climate scientists, I have to tell you, you've been covering this, Chris, [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=389.97999999999996s)]
*  the way this year is turning out, they are concerned. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=394.17999999999995s)]
*  Many of them are scared. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=398.17999999999995s)]
*  Things seem to be happening faster than the climate models were predicting 10 years ago. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UlTX7YSwYP4&t=400.38s)]
