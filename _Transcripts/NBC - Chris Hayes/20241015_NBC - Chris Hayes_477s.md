Video Description: “It's all part of Trump's dangerous shtick. It would be funny if the consequences weren't so serious—that this could happen and it could raise prices on so many middle class families across the country,” says Ian Sams, senior spokesman for the Harris campaign.

# ‘Dangerous schtick’ Harris campaign blasts Trump’s ‘rambling’ interview on economy
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 15, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ)
*  Today Donald Trump actually faced some tough questions in the kind of real adversarial [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=0.0s)]
*  interview he's been dodging from most of the campaign, hasn't done in a month at least. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=4.5200000000000005s)]
*  I can tell you the reviews from Trump advisor Stephen Miller were glowing. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=9.120000000000001s)]
*  Trump's Bloomberg interview with the Economic Club in Chicago is the greatest live interview [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=13.72s)]
*  any political leader or politician has done on the economy in our lifetimes, period. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=17.400000000000002s)]
*  Wow. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=22.64s)]
*  Got to see that. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=23.64s)]
*  Sat down with Bloomberg editor in chief John Mickleweight, who pressed Trump on a wide [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=26.48s)]
*  range of topics, especially his economic policies. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=33.44s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=56.04s)]
*  Why should they trust you with that? [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=57.04s)]
*  Because we're about growth. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=58.519999999999996s)]
*  She's got no growth whatsoever and we're all about growth. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  To me the most beautiful word in the dictionary is tariff and it's my favorite word. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=62.6s)]
*  Tariffs also have another side. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=68.6s)]
*  Isn't that something that you have to acknowledge? [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=70.92s)]
*  No. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=72.2s)]
*  You could be plunging America into the biggest trade war since Smoot Hall. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=73.2s)]
*  But there are no tariffs. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=76.4s)]
*  You're going to stop, you're going to, there are tariffs already. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=77.4s)]
*  No there are no tariffs. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=79.4s)]
*  All you have to do is build your plant in the United States and you don't have any tariffs. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=80.4s)]
*  It must be hard for you to spend 25 years talking about tariffs as being negative and [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=84.16s)]
*  then have somebody explain to you that you're totally wrong. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=88.16s)]
*  Critics say your tariffs will end up being like a national sales tax. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=91.36s)]
*  No. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=94.44s)]
*  The countries are... [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=95.44s)]
*  If you have, America at the moment has three trillion dollars worth of imports, you're [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=96.44s)]
*  going to add tariffs to every single one of them. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=100.72s)]
*  That is going to push up the cost for all those people who want to buy foreign goods. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=102.72s)]
*  No. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=106.52s)]
*  What's going to happen? [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=107.52s)]
*  That is just simple mathematics, President Trump. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=108.52s)]
*  It's not. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=109.52s)]
*  Yeah it is. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=110.52s)]
*  But not the way you figure it. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=111.52s)]
*  I'm joined now by Ian Sam, Senior Spokesman for the Harris campaign. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=112.88s)]
*  It's good to have you on. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=118.6s)]
*  And I want to start on that last point, which is something that I think hasn't really gotten [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=119.6s)]
*  quite as much of attention as it should. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=124.19999999999999s)]
*  But obviously Vice President Harris has talked about this quite a bit. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=125.88s)]
*  She talked about the debate. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=129.0s)]
*  How serious do you think voters should take this promise of across the board tariffs of [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=131.0s)]
*  10, 20%, 100%, 500%, 1000% coming from the Trump campaign? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=137.36s)]
*  Did you take it really seriously? [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=144.72000000000003s)]
*  We've seen reporting just in the last month or so about how Donald Trump has the authority [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=146.08s)]
*  to even implement these without Congress. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=151.04000000000002s)]
*  I think that for a long time there's been constraints from even some in his own party [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=153.08s)]
*  in Congress who might pull him back from doing such a damaging act, but not anymore. [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=157.26000000000002s)]
*  And I think that what strikes me about the way he talked about this today is he's trying [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=162.70000000000002s)]
*  to leave the impression that he actually cares about manufacturing in the United States [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=166.28s)]
*  and manufacturers in the United States. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=171.0s)]
*  He doesn't. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=173.36s)]
*  He doesn't have a real plan to actually create manufacturing jobs. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=174.36s)]
*  He has a plan to cut taxes for people at the very top and big corporations. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=178.02s)]
*  That's his only plan. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=181.26s)]
*  And in fact, today he kind of showed his hand a little bit in this weird and angry and kind [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=182.26s)]
*  of confrontational interview today where he was agitated and sort of rambling the whole [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=187.96s)]
*  time. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=194.08s)]
*  He even showed his hand. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=195.08s)]
*  He belittled autoworkers by saying that American autoworkers actually just get everything shipped [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=196.79999999999998s)]
*  to them in a box and all they do is take them out and put it together. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  It's a job a child could do. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=205.51999999999998s)]
*  I mean, that just shows you how he doesn't actually care about the underlying issue here [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=207.04s)]
*  of creating good, high-paying manufacturing jobs. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=211.51999999999998s)]
*  Vice President Harris does. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=214.76s)]
*  She rolled out a whole plan to try to create the jobs of the future by investing in American [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=215.76s)]
*  manufacturing in the same way we've seen with the Chips and Science Act and other major [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=219.96s)]
*  investments in the last few years that are creating thousands of manufacturing jobs. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=224.20000000000002s)]
*  And so, again, it's all part of Trump's sort of dangerous shtick. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  It would be funny if the consequences weren't so serious that this could happen and it could [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=233.0s)]
*  raise prices on so many middle-class families across the country. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=237.56s)]
*  Yeah, one of the things they talked about, too, was immigration and prices there. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=241.08s)]
*  I want to just play this exchange because I thought it was a good job by Mr. Mick Lathwaite [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=246.76s)]
*  on sort of pressing him on this. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=252.64000000000001s)]
*  Let's take a lesson. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=253.67999999999998s)]
*  The Congressional Budget Office is banking on the fact that there will be $9 trillion [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=254.67999999999998s)]
*  added to the GDP of America over the next 10 years by immigrants. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=260.68s)]
*  You want to stop that process. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=266.52s)]
*  For all the people who run businesses in the audience, I'm just focusing on the economic [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=268.44s)]
*  thing. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=272.59999999999997s)]
*  Are you prepared to say, look, it's fine to have a slightly smaller economy in exchange [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=273.59999999999997s)]
*  for having the immigration control that you want? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=277.64s)]
*  The simple answer, I want a lot of people to come into our country, but I want them [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=280.04s)]
*  to come in legally. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=284.76000000000005s)]
*  I don't want to have murderers. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=286.6s)]
*  So you heard that applause. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=289.68s)]
*  This is a line I've heard from voters I've talked to who say, no, I don't like people [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=290.76000000000005s)]
*  coming in legally. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=294.08000000000004s)]
*  It's fine to have them legally. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=295.08000000000004s)]
*  And Trump has been sort of simultaneously saying he's going to round up 11 million people, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=296.08000000000004s)]
*  but that he wants to expand legal immigration, although I should say he curtailed it in his [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=299.92s)]
*  first term, just to be very clear. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=303.72s)]
*  Do you think that's a promise voters should take at face value? [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=306.02s)]
*  Well, you mentioned that in his first term, he actually restricted legal immigration, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=310.58s)]
*  cutting visas and things like that. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=316.53999999999996s)]
*  And Project 2025 will go even further. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=317.9s)]
*  It's going to make even more draconian cuts to our legal immigration system because the [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=320.09999999999997s)]
*  guy whose tweet you showed a minute ago, Stephen Miller, runs the show, and he has made very [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=326.09999999999997s)]
*  clear since the days he worked for Senator Jeff Sessions that his agenda is to end legal [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=330.53999999999996s)]
*  immigration in America. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=334.98s)]
*  And so these kind of ideas are exactly why you're seeing mainstream economists come out [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=336.18s)]
*  and say Donald Trump is the candidate who's going to raise inflation. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=340.66s)]
*  Sixty eight percent, I think, was the number in the Wall Street Journal's economist survey. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=343.5s)]
*  The Wall Street Journal, hardly a liberal bastion, coming out with 68 percent of the [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=347.18s)]
*  economists they surveyed saying that Donald Trump's plans would create a higher inflation. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=352.06s)]
*  These are the consequences of his ideas. [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=357.26s)]
*  He's claiming that he would bring down costs for people, but his actual ideas would raise [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=360.22s)]
*  costs for people. In the same interview today, he complained about the interest rate cut [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=365.42s)]
*  that we saw from the Fed most recently. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=369.98s)]
*  He's basically saying, I wish Americans were paying higher mortgage rates, higher car loan [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=372.1s)]
*  rates. That's the agenda that he is running on. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=375.86s)]
*  Vice President Harris strongly disagrees. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=378.66s)]
*  She thinks that we need to actually invest in the American worker, invest in the middle [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=381.26s)]
*  class, create new small businesses and bring down costs for people. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=384.78s)]
*  And she has actual real concrete plans to do it. [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=388.62s)]
*  And I think the last point I'll make on this, Donald Trump, you watch him, whether it's in [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=390.9s)]
*  his weird dance fest last night, which I think maybe would be easy to laugh at, or today [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=394.62s)]
*  in this in this Bloomberg interview where he thought he was doing really well, but clearly [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=399.7s)]
*  wasn't. He's only talking about himself. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=403.94s)]
*  He thinks it's all about him. [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=406.46s)]
*  He doesn't think this election is about actually helping the American people in any way, [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=408.21999999999997s)]
*  shape or form. He thinks it's all a big show for him. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=411.82s)]
*  And that is probably one of the clearest contrasts that you're going to see in the last [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=415.42s)]
*  three weeks of this race. You're going to see the vice president out on the trail every [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=418.58s)]
*  single day talking about her ideas, going to these big media platforms to share her [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JviVXtyhWBQ&t=421.98s)]
