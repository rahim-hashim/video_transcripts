# ‘Sam Bankman-Fraud’: Fallen crypto king found guilty on all counts
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI)
*  Just before our show tonight, we got some breaking news out of another Manhattan courtroom. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=0.0s)]
*  A jury found former cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman Fried guilty on all seven counts against him. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=5.0s)]
*  Prosecutors alleged the 31-year-old founder of the FTX exchange used the company as basically a personal piggy bank [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=12.5s)]
*  and built a quote pyramid of deceit. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=19.5s)]
*  Last year, of course, FTX collapsed and Bankman Fried was charged with stealing tens of billions of dollars from customers. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=22.0s)]
*  After a month-long trial, the jury deliberated for just four and a half hours before convicting him on charges of fraud and conspiracy. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=28.0s)]
*  Bankman Fried now faces more than 100 years in prison. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=36.0s)]
*  He's also facing another trial on charges including bribing foreign officials, which is scheduled to begin in March. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=39.0s)]
*  Stephanie Ruhl is the host of the 11th Hour on MSNBC, as well as MSNBC's senior business analyst, and she joins me now. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=45.0s)]
*  I gotta say, for a relatively complicated fraud, you know, white collar case where you're looking at numbers and books, four and a half hours on every count is wow. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=51.0s)]
*  This is stunning that it was so quick, and it speaks to the fact that the government rolled up. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=62.0s)]
*  They took his closest confidants, his ex-girlfriend who worked for him, the top lieutenants in his company. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=68.0s)]
*  They all cooperated with the government, and they turned on him. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=74.0s)]
*  And what was stunning was in the last week that Sam Bankman Fried, who, you know, is not necessarily the best communicator, doesn't present well, chose to take the stand. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=77.0s)]
*  And what did the prosecution do? Hit him right between the eyes and showed up with receipts. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=86.0s)]
*  They used his own words and his own lieutenants' proof and said, no, sir, this is what you did. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=91.0s)]
*  And that's sort of what people are saying. He almost has the ghost of Trump, right? [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=97.0s)]
*  When you think about all the people that the government is rolling up against Trump right now, and could they turn to him and say, no, sir, these are your words. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=101.0s)]
*  These are the documents. So the prosecution showed up with the receipts and boom, in four hours, guilty on everything. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=108.0s)]
*  That's stunning. Yeah. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=115.0s)]
*  And I think part of it, I mean, there's two things here, right? [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=116.0s)]
*  One is the hubris of testifying for yourself, which usually you don't do that. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=118.0s)]
*  But this sort of idea of like, I can talk my way out of this, which I think. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=122.0s)]
*  But that's how he's always seen himself. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=125.0s)]
*  Yes. And he's even through this whole thing, he's been talking to reporters, he's been giving interviews like, bro, don't. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=127.0s)]
*  During this, he was taking phone calls from me months and months ago, right? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=132.0s)]
*  I obviously wanted an interview. I would talk to this man on the phone thinking, I can't believe this. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=136.0s)]
*  But he has always felt like this business, this corporate world, I know better, which is the same thing he felt about politics and every other vertical. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=141.0s)]
*  He viewed people over the age of 40, you and me, useless. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=150.0s)]
*  Well, I mean, I imagine there were some on the jury. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=155.0s)]
*  I mean, part of the thing, too, about this case, as surprising as it is for a sort of complex case like this, again, it's not that complex. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=159.0s)]
*  But to come down so quickly is that the core of the crime was not complex. Right? [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=166.0s)]
*  OK, you just hit everything. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=171.0s)]
*  Because people from the outside are like, oh, crypto, I don't get it. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=173.0s)]
*  This isn't about crypto, right? It's about stealing. It is about saying, oh, I'm losing money over here. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=176.0s)]
*  I've got all these customer funds over here. I'm going to move A and stick it over to B. Right? [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=183.0s)]
*  Ding, ding, ding. You have just explained the high. Sam Bankman fraud right there. Right? [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=190.0s)]
*  This isn't about how crypto works. The market went up and a margin call. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=194.0s)]
*  Yes. If your banker had a problem with sports gambling and was out to the mob and then just decided, well, there's a few thousand dollars sitting in your account. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=198.0s)]
*  Maybe he could pay off the guy. Gambling banks, we all understand, like, absolutely can't do that. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=208.0s)]
*  That's essentially the government's case against. I'm going to defend him for one moment. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=213.0s)]
*  Yeah. One of the reasons he did believe his own hype is everyone else did. OK, the biggest names in finance. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=216.0s)]
*  Remember that Super Bowl? It was the most insane thing I've ever seen. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=224.0s)]
*  It was the FTX Super Bowl. And I don't just mean Tom Brady and Gisele. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=229.0s)]
*  You had some of the biggest investors, the most sophisticated investors on Wall Street that could be huge fees investing in this guy. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=234.0s)]
*  Right. Last year, it was just a year ago. Plus a few weeks. He spoke at a huge finance conference in New York. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=241.0s)]
*  Everybody rolled up there wearing suits. That guy showed up in his Dungeons and Dragons look with the hair and the place worshipped the ground he walked on. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=248.0s)]
*  So he believed his own hype. But so did everyone else. And we shouldn't forget that. [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=256.0s)]
*  I actually, you know, in defense of the Dungeons and Dragons look, I respect a man that shows up like that to a thing. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=260.0s)]
*  But he is now, I mean, it's really wild. I mean, talk about whatever. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=265.0s)]
*  It's sort of almost a cliche to talk about a meteoric rise and fall, which is a thing that we do in our line of work. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=269.0s)]
*  But wow, maybe you are. Wow. I mean, the guy went from some random trader that no one had heard of to one of the richest people in the world and maybe worth like 30 billion dollars. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=274.0s)]
*  Correct. Correct. To now looking at 100 years in federal prison. And that whole thing happened over the course of four or five years. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=286.0s)]
*  And thought he was going to change the world and change the world. The world operated, change politics. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=293.0s)]
*  He was intervening in Democratic primaries all over the place. He was giving Mitch McConnell money. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=298.0s)]
*  Okay, but right there. So you're going to see in some media right now, people saying, don't forget, Sam Bankman freed deeply tied to the Democratic Party and Republicans. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=302.0s)]
*  Right. You interviewed Michael Lewis, who just wrote a massive book on Sam Bankman freed a few weeks ago. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=312.0s)]
*  And and Sam Michael Lewis was with Sam as Sam was headed to Washington for dinner with Mitch McConnell, according to Michael's book, where he was going to potentially help Mitch. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=317.0s)]
*  According to Michael, he was discussing how much money would he would Sam have to pay Trump to not run again? [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=327.0s)]
*  He had a scheme to Michael wrote the book saying this is a letter to the jury. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=334.0s)]
*  They'll decide. Well, guess what? I don't know. They decide. I don't know if they read the book, Stephanie. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=338.0s)]
*  But they decided. Always a pleasure. Thank you. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RDQ1dGw5xuI&t=342.0s)]
