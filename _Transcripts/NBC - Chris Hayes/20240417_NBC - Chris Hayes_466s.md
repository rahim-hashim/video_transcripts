# DeRay on the ‘wild case’ against him and how the Supreme Court responded
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA)
*  On Tuesday, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in an appeal from a former [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=0.0s)]
*  Pennsylvania police officer named Joseph Fisher, who was charged with multiple [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=4.2s)]
*  crimes for shoving his way into the Capitol on January 6th. You can see him [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=8.76s)]
*  there doing just that in a blue ball cap. He was charged with obstruction of an [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=13.08s)]
*  official proceeding, which in this case of course the congressional certification [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=18.580000000000002s)]
*  of the 2020 election. Hundreds of others have been charged or convicted of that [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=22.96s)]
*  as well, and he wants that felony charge dismissed. And the conservative majority [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=26.4s)]
*  of justices sounded skeptical of the charge and sympathetic to Fisher's [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=31.08s)]
*  argument that that obstruction law should only apply to evidence tampering [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=35.0s)]
*  and not say a congressional proceeding to certify an election. Here's the thing. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=39.16s)]
*  Hundreds of accused and convicted insurrections have been charged with [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=44.44s)]
*  this particular obstruction charge, and so was Donald Trump. And the court [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=47.68s)]
*  appeared to hold in oral arguments yesterday a sudden concern about the [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=51.56s)]
*  First Amendment right to peaceably assemble the possible use of this [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=55.88s)]
*  statutory charge by the government to overreach and criminalize it, which [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=59.24s)]
*  itself would be a perfectly legitimate concern if it weren't for the fact that [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=63.36s)]
*  on Monday, the day before those very same oral arguments, the same Supreme Court [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=68.08s)]
*  once again acted by not acting and allowed a lower court ruling to stand [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=72.6s)]
*  that would effectively make it legally impossible to organize protests in three [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=77.28s)]
*  states, particularly Black Lives Matter protests. In that case, a Louisiana [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=82.72000000000001s)]
*  police officer was injured by a protester, and he sued the man who he said [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=87.56s)]
*  organized the protest. And a federal court of appeals found that an organizer [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=92.52000000000001s)]
*  could basically be sued into ruination if a single protesty, protester commits [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=97.44000000000001s)]
*  an illegal act. The man who police say organized the protest in question was [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=104.4s)]
*  Dorae McKesson, and Dorae McKesson, whose name is on that too, civil rights [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=109.48s)]
*  organizer, Black Lives Matter activist, also hosted the podcast, Pod Save the [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=112.80000000000001s)]
*  People, joins me now. It's good to have you here. It's good to be here. So I just [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=116.0s)]
*  want to sort of walk people through this. This was a protest in Baton Rouge, I [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  believe, right in 2016 after the killing of Alden Sterling. And you were, I [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=123.60000000000001s)]
*  imagine, one of a bunch of people that were organizing protests, right? I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=128.44s)]
*  wasn't organizing it. I was just out there supporting people. I was tweeting [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=132.72s)]
*  about it, giving people to come in terms of Twitter, but I was not one of the [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=135.96s)]
*  organizers. We've repeatedly said this in all of the legal documents. You're [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=140.24s)]
*  just like a person who is protesting. I was out there supporting the protests, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=144.52s)]
*  and I was actually arrested pretty quickly. It was the photo that you had [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=147.68s)]
*  up. So I was in jail for 17 hours. So I was as shocked as anybody to get [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=151.4s)]
*  charged with this, but I was actually sued by five police officers. We got [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  them all dismissed, including this one. They appealed, and then we lost on [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=159.04000000000002s)]
*  appeal. So I've been dealing with this loss on appeal since 2016. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=163.24s)]
*  And I just want to be really clear here because there's some pretty firm [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=168.0s)]
*  precedent, right? Like, it cannot be the case that you could have a functioning [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=171.60000000000002s)]
*  First Amendment with the right to peaceably assemble and the right to have [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=175.68s)]
*  protests if any police officer who happens to be injured by one person at [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=179.20000000000002s)]
*  that protest could then say that this other person is civilly liable for that [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=185.24s)]
*  injury, which is the theory of this police officer and which the Supreme [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=190.08s)]
*  Court in past precedent has said no, that it doesn't work that way. Yeah, [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=193.64000000000001s)]
*  there's a historic case in NAACP versus Claiborne that says that you can't sue [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=196.72000000000003s)]
*  a protest organizer if somebody else just commits an act of violence or [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=202.08s)]
*  destruction. What is wild about my case is that we've never actually had a [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=206.08s)]
*  trial or a fact finding. The court has to take his allegations as fact. So the [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=209.32000000000002s)]
*  idea that I actually organized it, they have to take his fact, did he even [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=213.76000000000002s)]
*  get hurt? I don't know. We've never he's never produced anything to say their [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=217.35999999999999s)]
*  action was an injury. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=220.68s)]
*  But this is just about that threshold legal issue. Like, do we want to open [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=221.72s)]
*  the door? Yes. And there's other examples, too. In 2023, the court had [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=225.32s)]
*  another case, this countryman case, which Sotomayor talks about in her note, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=230.23999999999998s)]
*  saying, wait a second, we already have court precedent saying this is nonsense [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=235.84s)]
*  other than this other finding. So like, you it seems to me you've got a real [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=240.92s)]
*  rogue Fifth Circuit here that is opening a very dangerous door for peaceful [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=244.28s)]
*  protest. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=248.51999999999998s)]
*  And remember that this case, we went to the Fifth Circuit twice, we got split [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=249.24s)]
*  opinions both times, we went to the Supreme Court twice is actually the [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=252.84s)]
*  second time at the court. The first time the Supreme Court said, we need to ask [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=255.96s)]
*  Louisiana State Supreme Court if you can be sued. So we go to Louisiana, they say [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=259.64s)]
*  yes, I can be sued. We're like, well, that's not good. Then we come back to [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=263.96s)]
*  the Supreme Court. And thankfully, Sotomayor's statement makes it so that [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=267.76s)]
*  it'll be very hard to apply the Fifth Circuit's logic in the decision they [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=273.2s)]
*  made about my case. So that is a good thing. Yeah. So her decision, you seem [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=277.64s)]
*  confident at the lower court level. This is like basically temporary. Yes. We [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=281.08s)]
*  think that Sotomayor statement is actually gonna make it impossible to [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=286.03999999999996s)]
*  enforce what the Fifth Circuit did. We also feel confident that we're gonna [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  actually win my case when we actually go to court, and that people should not be [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=292.15999999999997s)]
*  nervous to protest in these three states. The ACLU has said that they will [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=295.88s)]
*  represent people if somebody, if another officer does try to invoke the Fifth [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=299.44s)]
*  Circuit decision. But we are thankful that Sotomayor's note actually does [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=303.44s)]
*  sort of make it really hard to apply. We wish it had been a more forceful, like [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=307.68s)]
*  summary reversal. Yeah, I mean, the court should have stepped in and been like, [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=311.52s)]
*  this is wildly out of line with our precedent. It got me listed five times. I mean, this is a wild case. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=315.6s)]
*  It is a wild case. And I mean, eight years on the notion in the face of all precedent [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=320.32s)]
*  and all logic about the First Amendment and the importance of civil disobedience [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=326.0s)]
*  and protest in this country's history to create this liability standard is just, [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=331.52s)]
*  I mean, the implications of it are bizarre. And to get caught up, you know, I'm thankful [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=335.92s)]
*  that the ACLU supported me, David Goldberg, Billy, all the lawyers have been incredible. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=340.0s)]
*  But the sheer amount of time and energy it has been to like turn over the text messages. I got [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=344.4s)]
*  deposed in this case. But the district court case got put on hold because we were waiting for the [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=348.8s)]
*  Supreme Court. But now we have to go back to district court in Baton Rouge. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=352.32s)]
*  This is part of both sort of the lawsuit itself, the Fifth Circuit's logic to the extent, the fact [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=355.84s)]
*  that the Supreme Court didn't step in to proactively say this is nonsense. It seems all the piece with [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=361.12s)]
*  a lot of backlash against protests we've seen from the right. And I wanted to ask you about [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=366.48s)]
*  Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas, who's talking about people protesting the war in Gaza, [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=371.84s)]
*  who were stopping traffic, who had placed themselves and basically said you should take [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=377.6s)]
*  matters into your own hands. He also said that they may have to have their skin ripped off [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=381.6s)]
*  if they were glued to something. What does it do to American democracy to have prominent folks like [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=385.52000000000004s)]
*  that in prominent positions with their sights on protesters in this way? Yeah, you know, I think [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=392.0s)]
*  their intent is to have a chilling effect so people won't go to the street. The good news is [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=397.20000000000005s)]
*  that there's a long history of civil disobedience in this country that the civil rights movement, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=400.88s)]
*  I think about 2014, it's going to be 10 years since the protests in Ferguson, that birth of [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=404.64000000000004s)]
*  movement, a generation of people coming to the streets. And I don't think that's going to stop. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=409.04s)]
*  I think that we see with the protests around Gaza, the protests around abortion, that people [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=412.72s)]
*  are continuing are not scared because of senators like Cotton making wild statements. And you know, [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=416.96000000000004s)]
*  if I said something like that, I would have another court case against me. And that would be very quick. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=422.08000000000004s)]
*  You're right. You are absolutely right. If they could find you saying take matters into your own [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=426.96000000000004s)]
*  hands, you would be in a lot of trouble. Dorian McCaskin, it's really good to have you here. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=430.56s)]
*  Good to be here. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=433.6s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X7dQQFh0DVA&t=463.6s)]
