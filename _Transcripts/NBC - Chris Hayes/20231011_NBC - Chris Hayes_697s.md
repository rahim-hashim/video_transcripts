# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Oct. 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI)
*  Ali Velshi has reported extensively from war zones across the world. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=0.0s)]
*  He spent a lot of time in both Israel and Gaza. [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=3.2800000000000002s)]
*  He's host of Velshi and MSNBC. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=5.28s)]
*  He joins me now live from Ashdod, Israel, about 15 miles from the border with Gaza. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=6.88s)]
*  Ali, I imagine the nation is in anguish and shock and grief. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=12.36s)]
*  How are people processing what has happened there in Israel and your day reporting there? [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=17.96s)]
*  Everybody is on edge in this entire region. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=26.44s)]
*  I've been speaking to a number of Israeli Defense Force members today. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=29.119999999999997s)]
*  And at one point today, something happened around us and 50 of them started running by with their guns. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=33.6s)]
*  Everybody is on edge. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=40.36s)]
*  In fact, as we're speaking right now, I just mentioned to my team that we hadn't heard bombing in Gaza. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=42.48s)]
*  It's 15 miles over there. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=48.08s)]
*  We hadn't heard bombing for a while. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=49.44s)]
*  The way the bombing is working is there are four hour shifts. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=50.92s)]
*  The bombs come, the missiles come from the Navy off the coast of Gaza. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=53.64s)]
*  For four hours and then the fighter jets start. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=59.04s)]
*  Now the fighter jets have started and we're hearing you might hear it or you might see it on the other camera that we've got. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=62.16s)]
*  Every couple of minutes or so, you see another explosion in Gaza and you hear the sound. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=67.6s)]
*  Now, the issue here, Chris, is that there are two camps in Israel. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=72.6s)]
*  There is the very frustrated, fearful, angry camp of people who want Hamas destroyed and they want to see the strongest possible attack [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=78.08s)]
*  in response to the strongest terrorist attack that this country has seen. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=88.16s)]
*  On the other hand, there are the families, as you said, of not just the 150 or so hostages that Israel believes are being held in Gaza, [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=93.08s)]
*  but the people who don't know whether their family members are hostages or not. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=100.28s)]
*  Their priority, and there's another one of those booms as another missile strike hits Gaza, [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=104.67999999999999s)]
*  their families want them to be rescued first. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=109.8s)]
*  They want that to be the priority. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=113.92s)]
*  In fact, earlier today, I went to talk to a woman. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=115.76s)]
*  She is from the kibbutz, which abuts Gaza, right on the other side of the fence, in which many people were killed and taken from, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=118.56s)]
*  which many people were killed and taken hostage. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=125.48s)]
*  She believed that her husband was a hostage. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=127.36s)]
*  So we arranged to go and meet with her. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=129.64s)]
*  And as we approached, we heard her screaming. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=131.0s)]
*  We saw her on a balcony. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=133.48s)]
*  She was screaming into a phone said, why are you telling me this by phone? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=134.8s)]
*  And what it turned out was that the army had just called her to tell her husband was not a hostage, that he was dead. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=138.92s)]
*  He was found dead with a bullet through his head. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=144.35999999999999s)]
*  So she was too distraught to talk to us. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=146.76s)]
*  In fact, her mother called an ambulance just to deal with the fact that she was as shattered and distraught as she was. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=148.79999999999998s)]
*  Her mother then came out to talk to me a little bit. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=155.44s)]
*  And here's what she told me. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=158.23999999999998s)]
*  Is she OK? Do you want to go back to see her? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=162.07999999999998s)]
*  I go back. She's not OK. She wants to be OK. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=163.72s)]
*  We cannot be OK after such a tragedy. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=167.72s)]
*  But we will do our best that we can to help. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=171.16s)]
*  That's what we can. We must be strong. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=176.12s)]
*  We must help. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=179.04s)]
*  A child by one month. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=181.76s)]
*  And that last thing she told me is that her daughter had a one month old child. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=186.64s)]
*  Her husband told her run with the baby. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=190.04s)]
*  They were trapped for 28 hours. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=192.2s)]
*  She ran with the baby. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=193.68s)]
*  She got out, got to a shelter. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=195.12s)]
*  The army found her. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=196.84s)]
*  She went to her mother's house and she had just been telling a reporter from Sky News before before this news occurred that she's hoping that her husband is a hostage and that he'll be freed soon. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=197.68s)]
*  Chris, I want to just follow up on the hostage situation. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=206.56s)]
*  Obviously, I think Hamas had put out a statement today threatening the lives of those hostages if Israel struck Gaza without warning. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=209.84s)]
*  I think was there what they said? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=218.24s)]
*  Obviously, this is incredibly complicating for the calculus here for the Israeli government. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=220.44s)]
*  One hundred and fifty hostages. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=227.0s)]
*  It's a lot of people. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=228.16s)]
*  And what what is what is being communicated about that? [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=229.84s)]
*  I mean, I have to imagine that their safety is very much front of mind as people process the the the effects of this atrocity. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=234.64000000000001s)]
*  So today, the families of the hundred or so people that Israel knows or thinks they know are hostages have been informed or they've been the government's been reaching out to them, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=246.0s)]
*  to say, we believe your loved one is one of the hostages. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=255.84s)]
*  The problem with this is what how do you get the hostages out? [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=258.68s)]
*  There is no formal relationship. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=261.48s)]
*  There's no meaningful dialogue between Israel and Hamas. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=263.08s)]
*  There's no meaningful dialogue between America and Hamas. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=266.36s)]
*  Hamas deals with Iran. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=269.16s)]
*  Hamas sometimes deals with with Qatar. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=270.52000000000004s)]
*  So you can either negotiate a release. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=272.64s)]
*  At one point, Hamas had said, if you release, we'll we'll give some people back in order for some for some prisoners. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=275.28000000000003s)]
*  We'll give your hostages back in order for every prisoner to be released. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=281.40000000000003s)]
*  That's not happening at the moment. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=285.32s)]
*  So the option B is, as you said, a ground offensive into Gaza to rescue these hostages. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=286.76s)]
*  But Gaza, Israel can see everything from the top in Gaza. [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=291.96000000000004s)]
*  They have drones above Gaza all the time. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=295.40000000000003s)]
*  They know they know what the topography looks like. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=297.16s)]
*  They have no idea what's inside those buildings or underneath those buildings. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=299.08s)]
*  Those hostages could be anywhere and they could be human shields. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=302.08s)]
*  So the complexity of getting those hostages freed is is really a major issue. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=305.32s)]
*  Ali Delshi, thank you. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=310.12s)]
*  Stay safe. Thanks for being there for us. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=311.88s)]
*  There's still so many families desperately waiting to hear the fate of their loved ones. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=316.24s)]
*  Not knowing if they're alive or dead or hostages. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=320.96000000000004s)]
*  Infants in their mother's arms, grandparents in wheelchairs, Holocaust survivors abducted and held hostage. [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=325.32s)]
*  The United States is expediting military aid to Israel amid its emerging war with Moss. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=334.68s)]
*  President Biden said the Pentagon will be sending ammunition as well as rockets to replenish [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=338.76s)]
*  Israel's Iron Dome defense system. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=343.08s)]
*  That is in addition to nearly four billion dollars in military aid the U.S. sends to Israel every year. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=345.64s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy is a Democrat of Connecticut. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=350.76s)]
*  He serves on the Foreign Relations Committee and he joins me now. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=352.68s)]
*  Senator, it's good to have you. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=355.72s)]
*  What do you view the role of the U.S. in this, [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=357.4s)]
*  particularly Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate, in what happens next here? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=359.88s)]
*  We just finished up a Senate briefing with the administration and the State Department. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=366.04s)]
*  First, we do need to get military support to Israel. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=369.96000000000004s)]
*  Right now we are working with Israelis to understand what they need most urgently. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=374.6s)]
*  Second, we need to get a full diplomatic team on the ground in the Middle East. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=379.40000000000003s)]
*  I think it's clear we'll have an ambassador to the Middle East by the end of next week. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=383.40000000000003s)]
*  But we also need an ambassador in Lebanon, right? [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=386.36s)]
*  That's where the work is going to be done to stop a front from opening up on Israel's north. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=389.32000000000005s)]
*  And then third, we need to really robustly do work with our partners to try to find [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=394.84s)]
*  mechanisms of de-escalation. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=402.28s)]
*  So right now that means working with the Qataris and the Egyptians, countries that are allies of [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=403.8s)]
*  the United States who receive a lot of military assistance from the United States to try to use [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=409.88s)]
*  the contacts they have with Hamas to find a peaceful end to this hostage crisis which likely [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=413.96s)]
*  involves American citizens as well. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=418.28s)]
*  So those are three lines of effort. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=420.2s)]
*  Those are three things that we talked about on the phone call with the administration tonight. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=421.48s)]
*  On that last line, I mean, again, I can only speak to my experience as an American journalist [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=424.36s)]
*  covering American policy through the years. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=428.84000000000003s)]
*  I remember in the run-up to the Iraq War, the UK said, you're Tony Blair's government, [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=432.84000000000003s)]
*  said you're our ally and we stand four square behind you and what you think you have to do. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=437.56s)]
*  And that proved to be catastrophic, strategically, for the country, for the region. [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=441.96000000000004s)]
*  I think there's concern some have expressed that the US says to the Israeli government, [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=447.0s)]
*  do whatever you have to do, whatever, and that that will perhaps abet massive strategic [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=452.28000000000003s)]
*  miscalculations or incredible amounts of misery and civilian death in Gaza. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=459.56s)]
*  Well, listen, right now the focus is on accountability, finding out who is missing, [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=466.52000000000004s)]
*  who is being held hostage, and understanding what the American interest is here. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=472.68s)]
*  But of course, we expect the Israelis to act proportionally and we will give them as much [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=478.28000000000003s)]
*  assistance as is necessary to find and target Hamas without any unnecessary civilian casualties. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=485.88s)]
*  But Hamas is going to nestle itself in civilian neighborhoods, in civilian buildings, and so there [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=494.68s)]
*  is likely going to be some civilian casualties as part of this campaign. And of course, we will do [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=502.04s)]
*  everything possible to help the Israelis make sure that their targeting limits that kind of activity. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=510.12s)]
*  In terms of the Americans, does the US government have a clear sense of American casualties [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=519.72s)]
*  and American possible hostages? Is that a known and determined fact? [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=527.48s)]
*  It is not yet. There is still so much chaos on the ground inside Israel. Israeli families [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=534.6s)]
*  right now don't understand who is hostage, who is dead, who is simply just missing. And we do not [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=542.6s)]
*  have a firm figure right now as to how many Americans are being held hostage. That work is [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=548.84s)]
*  ongoing. It was one of the questions that was raised on the call tonight and the administration [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=555.8s)]
*  is still trying to seek an answer to that question. That is very unsettling for American families who [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=559.32s)]
*  have loved ones in Israel, but this is a crisis that Israeli families are going through as well. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=565.0s)]
*  Immediately after the attack on Saturday, you saw some people, there was a Wall Street Journal [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=572.12s)]
*  article, but also politicians attempting to sort of pin this on the president's policy vis-a-vis Iran [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=577.72s)]
*  that the US had funded this through some sort of bank shot story about funds that are sitting at [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=583.32s)]
*  a Qatari bank and haven't even been transferred to Iran. Just respond to the idea that this was [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=589.8000000000001s)]
*  the outgrowth of this administration's Iran policy and attempts to reinstate a nuclear deal. [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=595.0s)]
*  Well, it's really sad to hear these lies being spread that the United States gave $6 billion [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=602.36s)]
*  to Iran to spend on Hamas' attack on Israel. This is a complicated story, but the bottom line for [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=609.32s)]
*  today is that not a single dime of that money has been transferred. It's Iran's money that was being [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=616.2s)]
*  held in a Korean bank account. It's not US money. Second, the reports that Iran has played a direct [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=621.64s)]
*  role in the planning of these attacks has not been confirmed in the United States yet, but that [[00:10:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=629.48s)]
*  question is kind of immaterial because Hamas would not exist if not for Iran's support, and so it is [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=636.52s)]
*  a bit of splitting hairs as to whether they were intimately involved in the planning of these attacks [[00:10:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=642.68s)]
*  or simply funded Hamas for decades to give them the ability to plan these attacks. There's no doubt [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=647.56s)]
*  that Iran has blood on its hands, but there's also no doubt that there was not a single dime [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=653.0799999999999s)]
*  of American money that ended up in the hands of Iran transferred to Hamas, as has been alleged [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=659.64s)]
*  by many opponents of the president who seem more intent on scoring political points against [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=666.2s)]
*  Democrats than they are in supporting Israel. Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut, thank you for making time with us. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzEF7LUX9QI&t=670.9200000000001s)]
