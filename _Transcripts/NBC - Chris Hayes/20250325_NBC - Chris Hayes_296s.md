# ‘Sheer, unfettered, Olympian incompetence’: Hayes on the Trump war plans breach
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [March 25, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o)
*  Good evening from New York, I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, the Trump White House has been caught in the worst, [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=2.24s)]
*  most embarrassing, most dangerous security breach [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=4.76s)]
*  of our lifetime. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=8.2s)]
*  The details, I'm sure you've heard some of them, [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=9.44s)]
*  are almost too ridiculous to be true. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=12.24s)]
*  Trump's cabinet accidentally texted war plans, [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=15.68s)]
*  like imminent details, to the editor-in-chief [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=20.04s)]
*  of one of America's most prominent magazines. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=23.2s)]
*  This was not an anonymous leak or a hack [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=26.2s)]
*  by a foreign adversary, but rather an act of sheer, [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=28.32s)]
*  unfettered Olympian incompetence. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=32.16s)]
*  Members of Trump's cabinet, including Secretary of Defense [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=36.24s)]
*  and the Vice President, all hopped on a group chat [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=38.76s)]
*  on Signal, it's a commercial encrypted messaging platform [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=41.84s)]
*  anyone can download from the App Store, [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=45.32s)]
*  to discuss detailed, clearly classified plans [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=47.44s)]
*  about a military strike in Yemen. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=51.92s)]
*  Trump's national security advisor accidentally included, [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=55.08s)]
*  why, we still don't know, Jeffrey Goldberg, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=60.28s)]
*  the editor-in-chief of the Atlantic Magazine, [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=64.67999999999999s)]
*  on the text chain. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=67.36s)]
*  We've since learned that one member of the chat, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=69.32s)]
*  and get this one, Steve Witkoff, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=71.44s)]
*  that's Trump's real estate buddy, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=73.4s)]
*  who is somehow now the special envoy to the Middle East [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=74.6s)]
*  and also handling negotiations with Russia, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=76.84s)]
*  was almost certainly physically in Moscow [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=79.96s)]
*  with his phony phone while participating [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=85.08s)]
*  in the text convo, possibly even in the Kremlin, [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=88.44s)]
*  which adds an entire new layer [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=92.92s)]
*  of just insane security concerns. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=94.64s)]
*  As does the fact that as a former White House official [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=97.84s)]
*  to Politico, many of the participants in the conversation [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=100.0s)]
*  were likely using their personal cell phones, [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=103.72s)]
*  since generally that encrypted text signal [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=106.12s)]
*  is not allowed on government devices. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=109.84s)]
*  Quote, their personal phones are all hackable. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=111.48s)]
*  Yeah, no kidding. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=114.64s)]
*  And it's highly likely that foreign intelligence services [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=115.88s)]
*  are sitting on their phones, [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=118.52s)]
*  watching them type the shit out, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  the former White House official warned. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=121.48s)]
*  Of course, that is apparently a little consequence [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=123.88s)]
*  to Trump's cabinet. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=126.04s)]
*  They are group texting classified stuff [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=127.64s)]
*  because it defies the rules, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=129.88s)]
*  because no one can hold them accountable, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=132.24s)]
*  because they're a bunch of incompetents, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=133.84s)]
*  because they wanna avoid [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=136.04s)]
*  the Freedom of Information Act requests, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=137.12s)]
*  they wanna avoid the prying eyes [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=138.96s)]
*  of responsible federal officials. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=140.56s)]
*  Remember what happened when Trump called Zelensky [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=141.96s)]
*  in his first term, right? [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=143.6s)]
*  They wanna avoid inspector general reports, right? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=145.07999999999998s)]
*  They're hiding it from others, [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=147.44s)]
*  just not foreign adversaries. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=149.48s)]
*  Today, Donald Trump defended the use of the commercial app, [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=151.28s)]
*  used to text change signal, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=154.51999999999998s)]
*  as well as his national security advisor, Michael Waltz, [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=156.2s)]
*  who again, got everyone together and added Goldberg. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=158.56s)]
*  I don't know anything about signal. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=163.76s)]
*  I wasn't involved in this, but I just heard about it. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=165.04s)]
*  And I hear it's used by a lot of groups, [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=168.07999999999998s)]
*  it's used by the media a lot. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=171.16s)]
*  It's used by a lot of the military, [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=173.88s)]
*  and I think successfully. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=175.8s)]
*  But sometimes somebody can get onto those things. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=178.08s)]
*  That's one of the prices you pay [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=180.28s)]
*  when you're not sitting in the situation room. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=182.16s)]
*  I always say you have to learn from every experience. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=185.20000000000002s)]
*  I think it was very unfair the way they attacked Michael. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=187.88s)]
*  He's a good person. [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=191.88s)]
*  The person that was on just happens to be a sleazebag. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=194.44s)]
*  So maybe that's just coincidence. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=197.0s)]
*  Despite the apparent vote of confidence from the president, [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=199.44s)]
*  did he have to go on TV in the last hour to defend himself? [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=202.35999999999999s)]
*  You know, Laura, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=207.0s)]
*  but of all the people out there, [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=209.68s)]
*  somehow this guy who has lied about the president, [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=212.72s)]
*  who has lied to Gold Star families, [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=216.35999999999999s)]
*  lied to their attorneys, and gone to Russia hoax, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=218.51999999999998s)]
*  gone to just all kinds of links [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=222.95999999999998s)]
*  to lie and smear the president of the United States, [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=226.4s)]
*  and he's the one that somehow gets on somebody's contact [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=230.08s)]
*  and then gets sucked into this group. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=234.48000000000002s)]
*  First of all, Goldberg didn't lie about any of the things [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=237.16s)]
*  that Waltz says he lied about. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=240.84s)]
*  Second of all, the somehow, [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=243.24s)]
*  like he somehow got sucked into this group, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=246.04000000000002s)]
*  is doing a lot of work here. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=247.76000000000002s)]
*  But bracketing the slander of the guy that Waltz himself [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=248.92000000000002s)]
*  apparently added to the chat, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=252.08s)]
*  if he's really the cretin you say, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=253.48000000000002s)]
*  doesn't it only make it worse [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=256.2s)]
*  that he's being texted wereplans? [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=257.6s)]
*  Doesn't it make it worse that you're using Signal, [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=260.16s)]
*  which apparently is so insecure [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=261.76s)]
*  that this scumbag, as you describe him, just hopped in? [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=264.36s)]
*  I mean, think about it for like 10 seconds. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=270.96s)]
*  Give it 10 seconds of thought. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9oJRqCzU5o&t=273.8s)]
