# 'Make them pay': Trump demands government punish MSNBC for critical coverage
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 29, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0)
*  Last night, you might be shocked to learn shows here on this network MSNBC covered the [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=0.0s)]
*  many legal threats Donald Trump faces and the dangers that he poses to democracy. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=5.5s)]
*  We on this show covered both those topics across three segments. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=10.02s)]
*  Now it's hard to say what exactly triggered the ex-president last night, but clearly something [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=13.540000000000001s)]
*  he saw or heard prompted Trump to do what he always does, rant angrily on social media. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=16.96s)]
*  This was his post in which he attacks MSNBC. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=23.32s)]
*  He misunderstands the difference between broadcast and cable, attacks the CEO of our parent company, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=26.44s)]
*  and then veers into this quote, our so-called government should come down hard on them and [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=31.16s)]
*  make them pay for their illegal political activity much more to come watch. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=35.400000000000006s)]
*  Now these attacks are not new territory for Trump. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=41.64s)]
*  It's easy to get bored with his whining. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=44.480000000000004s)]
*  I certainly am. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=46.24s)]
*  But I will say this again in the theme of our coverage here so far as we head towards [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=48.1s)]
*  the election, take this seriously. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=53.08s)]
*  I mean, he's telling you what he wants to do. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=55.88s)]
*  It's a man who wants to take power back, telling you what his policy on news organizations [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=58.92s)]
*  he doesn't like is. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=62.64s)]
*  He is very clear with his intent. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=63.64s)]
*  Our so-called government should come down on them hard and make them pay for their illegal [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=65.0s)]
*  political activity. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=69.32000000000001s)]
*  And here's the thing. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=71.04s)]
*  Yes, we have a First Amendment. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=72.04s)]
*  Yes, we got checks and balances, but with a determined enough government and the right [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=73.04s)]
*  henchmen in place, do you think for a moment that Trump's whining cannot turn into real [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=75.88s)]
*  punitive action? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=81.0s)]
*  Brian Stelzer is a media reporter and special correspondent for Vanity Fair. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=83.4s)]
*  He's author of the new book Network of Lies, the epic saga of Fox News, Donald Trump and [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=87.2s)]
*  the Battle for American Democracy, which is out now. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=91.24000000000001s)]
*  And he joins me now. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=93.80000000000001s)]
*  It's good to have you here. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=94.80000000000001s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=95.80000000000001s)]
*  Part of the thing that jumped out to me about this is that the idea of using the power of [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=96.80000000000001s)]
*  the state against a media outlet that's covering you in a way that you don't like is not an [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=100.28s)]
*  abstract idea. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=107.60000000000001s)]
*  In fact, there's some precedent here with CNN when there was an AT&T merger on the table [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=109.56s)]
*  with Time Warner that the Department of Justice intervened in. [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=117.52s)]
*  Yes, I worked at CNN at the time. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  Before Election Day 2016, Donald Trump said on the campaign trail that he would try to [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=123.76s)]
*  stop the deal from happening, try to stop AT&T from buying Time Warner. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=127.96000000000001s)]
*  And then once he was elected and once the deal was progressing through the process, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=132.02s)]
*  through the government regulatory system, the Trump DOJ tried to block it. [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=135.48000000000002s)]
*  And to federal court, giant lawsuit delayed the deal by more than a year. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=139.2s)]
*  AT&T stood up to the president, stood up to the DOJ, actually was willing to fight and [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=142.83999999999997s)]
*  they won in court. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=147.48s)]
*  They were able to win in court and the merger happened, but at great cost. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=148.48s)]
*  It delayed AT&T's battle against Netflix in the streaming wars. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=151.76s)]
*  And the broader point is that there is a significant amount of evidence that Donald Trump behind [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=154.76s)]
*  the scenes was trying to punish AT&T for owning CNN. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=158.88s)]
*  Again, this isn't the like, oh, what if? [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=162.72s)]
*  This is a thing that happened. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=165.79999999999998s)]
*  Here's the New Yorker reporting on this, Jane Mayer, talking about Gary Cohn being in a [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=167.0s)]
*  meeting who is the Department of National Economic Council. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=171.12s)]
*  According to Well and Forest source, Trump called Cohn to the office and he said in exasperation [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=174.0s)]
*  John Kelly, then chief of staff, I've been telling Cohn to get this lawsuit filed. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=178.84s)]
*  Nothing's happened. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=182.16000000000003s)]
*  I've mentioned it 50 times and nothing's happened. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  I want to make sure it's filed. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=184.56s)]
*  I want that deal blocked. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=185.60000000000002s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=187.0s)]
*  I want that deal blocked. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=188.0s)]
*  He was also on the phone at the time, Trump with Rupert Murdoch talking with Murdoch about [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=189.0s)]
*  this. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=192.92000000000002s)]
*  Murdoch then calls the AT&T CEO, Randall Stevenson, and says, hey, you want to get CNN off your [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=193.92s)]
*  back? [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  Want to get CNN? [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=199.23999999999998s)]
*  I'll buy CNN from you, which I interpreted and wrote at the time was a favor to Trump [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=200.23999999999998s)]
*  to try to take CNN and put it into cozy Trump hands. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=203.95999999999998s)]
*  Now, here's the thing I think that's so key about this story and the key about understanding [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=206.6s)]
*  democratic decline, because we've seen this in other countries. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=210.51999999999998s)]
*  The people at AT&T were like, we're not going to roll over. [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=213.11999999999998s)]
*  That's right. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=216.07999999999998s)]
*  Basically, for whatever reason, they stood up to Trump. [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=217.07999999999998s)]
*  They stood up to him, whether it's their principles, the dollars and play, whatever business. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=219.23999999999998s)]
*  They said, no, the thing that we've seen in other countries is an erosion of that whereby [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=223.84s)]
*  you start to see people at the highest echelons of a society start to play ball and start [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=228.52s)]
*  to be capped. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=233.32s)]
*  Right. [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=234.32s)]
*  Now, I've covered this parent network, Comcast, for nearly 20 years. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=235.32s)]
*  I know the executives at Comcast in Philly, they don't get rattled by a true social post. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=237.52s)]
*  They have defended this news operation. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=241.4s)]
*  They've defended NBC for as long as they've owned NBC. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=244.08s)]
*  But we are seeing this with other media companies, and we are, as you've said, seen it in other [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=246.68s)]
*  countries, in Hungary, in Turkey. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=251.04s)]
*  When the state comes in and takes regulatory action, takes legal action, uses an IRS, uses [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=253.12s)]
*  a branch of the government to punish a media company, and sometimes to take that media [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=258.44s)]
*  company off the playing field, it is a very real thing. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=262.08s)]
*  Yeah, that kind of squeeze. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=265.24s)]
*  Again, to be clear, it's like, yes, the First Amendment's here. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=266.52s)]
*  But the way the squeeze has worked in places like Hungary and Turkey, and I don't think [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=269.16s)]
*  there is robust democracies in America, but even when they started, it is, oh, the IRS [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=272.04s)]
*  now has opened a case on your back taxes. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=277.8s)]
*  There's new legislation that regulates entities that deliver an item to more than 10 million [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=280.04s)]
*  households every day. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=285.48s)]
*  It's like, oh, those are the newspapers. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=286.48s)]
*  And then lo and behold, you're paying fines and fees, and then someone comes along and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=288.8s)]
*  says, why don't I buy that from you, a la Rupert Murdoch? [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=293.56s)]
*  Why don't I take it off your hands? [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=296.96000000000004s)]
*  And that person is a buddy of the president. [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=298.44s)]
*  That's right. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=300.24s)]
*  And Comcast, of course, is an infrastructure company. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=301.24s)]
*  They provide broadband to my home and tens of millions of others. [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=302.40000000000003s)]
*  So you can imagine the ways Trump could try to turn the screws. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=305.04s)]
*  It's not just Comcast. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=307.88s)]
*  No, it's MSNBC. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=308.92s)]
*  It's still CNN. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=309.92s)]
*  It's still all of these players. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=310.92s)]
*  Look, on one level, Trump's post is just the weather, right? [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=312.71999999999997s)]
*  It's stormy today. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=315.48s)]
*  It'll be sunny tomorrow. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=316.48s)]
*  He'll rant about someone else tomorrow. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=317.48s)]
*  On another level, though, it's a severe thunderstorm warning. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=319.36s)]
*  It's a warning about what he will do if he regains power. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=321.6s)]
*  And that's why I think it's more notable than when he was in power and tried to punish AT&T [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=324.52s)]
*  or when he was in power and tried to punish the Washington Post owner, Jeff Bezos, because [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=328.92s)]
*  back then he would tweet and say, boycott AT&T. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=332.4s)]
*  And nobody would care. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=335.08s)]
*  The stock would go up that day. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=336.08s)]
*  It was meaningless. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=337.08s)]
*  But this time it's a campaign promise he's making to his voters. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=338.08s)]
*  And he made one the last time on CNN and that merger. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=341.24s)]
*  And he tried to hold to it. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=344.64s)]
*  Brian Stelter, always good to have you here. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=346.24s)]
*  Thanks so much. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FgXSdhZGbM0&t=347.24s)]
