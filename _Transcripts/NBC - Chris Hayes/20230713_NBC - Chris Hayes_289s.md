# 90 degree sea temperatures among 'most worrying signs’ of climate crisis
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 13, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs)
*  Every day we show you some new climate data point that is crazier than the last. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=0.0s)]
*  Well, here's today's edition. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=4.8s)]
*  The water temperature off the coast of Florida yesterday spiked above 98 degrees. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=6.28s)]
*  Ocean water, 98 degrees. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=13.68s)]
*  Also in Florida, you might recall that yesterday we told you farmers insurance [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=16.740000000000002s)]
*  is now the fourth home insurer to flee the state due largely to increased climate risk. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=20.48s)]
*  And according to industry numbers, the average home insurance premium in Florida [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=26.12s)]
*  is 42% higher than last year and miles ahead of the average premium nationwide. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=30.0s)]
*  Now, there's some local market reasons for that, but the main reason for this is simply [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=35.760000000000005s)]
*  climate disasters keep ravaging the state at a markedly increased clip, [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=40.56s)]
*  making it just too expensive to operate there. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=44.16s)]
*  Of course, Republicans like Governor Ron DeSantis, his administration, [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=47.040000000000006s)]
*  and members of the Florida congressional delegation are calling the problem a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=50.120000000000005s)]
*  liberal agenda, ignoring the numbers, attacking everyone from insurance companies, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=53.2s)]
*  following their business interests to President Joe Biden's point person on climate change. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=56.88s)]
*  That person, presidential envoy for climate John Kerry's on Capitol Hill today, [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=61.28s)]
*  being shouted out as an avatar of the radical woke mob as the ocean off Florida approaches sous vide levels. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=65.2s)]
*  You can't worry about the efficiency of your home if you can't make rent, [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=73.12s)]
*  if you can't make your mortgage payment and you can't worry about the emissions [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=77.08s)]
*  of your automobile payment of your automobile if you can't make the payment on your car. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=81.24000000000001s)]
*  I believe that you are representing a far left radical agenda. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=86.32000000000001s)]
*  Those are my beliefs. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=90.88s)]
*  Elizabeth Colbert is a staff writer for New Yorker who has covered climate change for decades. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=93.64s)]
*  She's also author of Under a White Sky, the Nature of the Future. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=98.04s)]
*  And she joins me now, Elizabeth. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=102.12s)]
*  Great to have you on. I'm such an admirer of your writing for many years on this topic. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=103.72s)]
*  I thought of you as we keep having one data point after another, someone who has chronicled this, [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=108.24s)]
*  written about the implications for a long time. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=113.24s)]
*  Just what you're thinking and feeling as you see this play out right now. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=115.88s)]
*  Well, it's a sort of sickening feeling, I have to say. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=120.72s)]
*  You know, and I think that it's probably shared. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=124.24s)]
*  I also sort of seized on that. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=127.4s)]
*  Those figures out of Florida, which are just absolutely, you know, I guess, paradoxically chilling. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=131.07999999999998s)]
*  I think a lot of scientists are looking at this spike in sea service temperatures as among the most worrying signs that you could have. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=136.48000000000002s)]
*  Scientists, you know, as you and I have discussed over the years, have been warning us about this for a really long time. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=147.88s)]
*  You know, with the first report on climate change, the dangers of climate change landed on President Johnson's desk in 1965. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=155.92000000000002s)]
*  And now we're watching everything that climate scientists predicted come true. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=163.76s)]
*  And the thing that is, I think, so frightening about it all is, you know, not just what is happening, but what this portends. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=169.44s)]
*  There are all these sort of cascading effects in your book about extinction and the ecosystem effects of this climate change. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=180.72s)]
*  I mean, one of the things I was seeing was coral bleaching and coral, which is obviously a huge part of the ocean ecosystem. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=189.88s)]
*  It has to be at a certain pretty narrow band of temperature. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=196.0s)]
*  So this poses a threat to that. I mean, I can't even compute the cascading effects of all this. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=198.72s)]
*  We think about the humans, but obviously it's playing throughout the entire ecosystems and particularly in the ocean. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=204.32s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that the effects that you're going to see with warming oceans are going to be, you know, immensely. [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=212.56s)]
*  Scientists make the point that the planet should have been called ocean. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=220.48s)]
*  70 percent of our planet is covered by ocean. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=223.6s)]
*  And when you warm up the oceans, you change a lot of the parameters that are crucial to marine life and will have ramifications for the weather on land. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=227.28s)]
*  Absolutely. Very serious ones. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=237.72s)]
*  But for example, one thing that you're doing, you know, warm water simply holds less oxygen than cold water. [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=239.28s)]
*  So you're going to get these tremendous dead zones where pretty much nothing can live. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=245.6s)]
*  And you're getting this stratification of the oceans as well, where you're not going to get upwelling of nutrients, which a lot of creatures need in the ocean. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=250.72s)]
*  So you're going to get, as you pointed out, these cascading effects. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=259.44s)]
*  And we are already seeing some of them and we're going to see more of them and coral. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQz3FBBXvzs&t=263.04s)]
