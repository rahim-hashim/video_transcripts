# WEB EXCLUSIVE Acclaimed Palestinian poet who escaped Gaza speaks with Chris Hayes
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE)
*  Back in November, we covered a story about a celebrated Palestinian poet and author named Mossab Abu Toha [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=0.0s)]
*  Who was trying to flee the war in Gaza with his wife and three kids [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=5.58s)]
*  Because his son was born in Boston and as a US citizen their family was cleared to leave through the Ra'afah crossing the south [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=9.58s)]
*  Which is at the southern end of the Gaza Strip. In the process of evacuating [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=15.72s)]
*  Israeli forces pulled Abu Toha aside and accused him of being Hamas activist [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=19.8s)]
*  He was held in detention where he was stripped naked and beaten [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=24.84s)]
*  Two days later an Israeli soldier released him and apologized for the mistake [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=28.66s)]
*  But during those two days when folks did not know where he was his disappearance [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=32.839999999999996s)]
*  Garnered a lot of attention from many of his colleagues and friends here in the US including the editor of the New Yorker David Remnick [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=36.42s)]
*  Along the way he was apprehended by the Israeli military for no seeming reason and taken into [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=43.22s)]
*  custody with dozens of other Palestinians and according to my information taken out of Israel taken to a [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=50.66s)]
*  military outpost in the Negev in southern Israel and was there for two days and [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  Was interrogated and there are reports that he was beaten and I have not confirmed this and I have not been able to speak with [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=63.32s)]
*  Mossab today, but my information and I think this is absolutely true. He said he's been [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=70.53999999999999s)]
*  Released and he's back in Gaza. Thank God with his family [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=76.3s)]
*  After Abu Toha was reunited with his family. He was able to flee Gaza in December [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=80.82s)]
*  He's since made his way to Syracuse University where he has a fellowship and joining me now is Mossaba Toha [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=85.24s)]
*  Palestinian writer and poet it's really great to have you here. Thank you Chris. I appreciate [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=91.8s)]
*  I [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=96.28s)]
*  Guess I want to start I know you have family that's still in Gaza and just ask about where they are and how they are doing [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=97.52s)]
*  So I have three siblings in North Gaza including my father [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=104.0s)]
*  My youngest sister is a mother of three children. The youngest is two years old [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=108.32s)]
*  The last time I could talk to her was ten days ago [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=113.08s)]
*  I don't know how she is surviving whether she is alive with her the moment we are speaking now [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=116.44s)]
*  There's an airstrike that would take away their lives [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=121.18s)]
*  Because Israel is not only cutting off water electricity and food, but they are also damaging the the phone [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=124.46s)]
*  Network so I can't even talk to my family and see what they are doing right now [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=133.07999999999998s)]
*  So before you were able you could be in communication and in the last ten days that's been cut off [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=136.76s)]
*  She's in the farthest northern part of the strip, which we know is where this very [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=141.68s)]
*  Intense and brutal assault has been happening over the last ten days and I mean [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=146.04000000000002s)]
*  I've been struggling for about 13 months even when I was in Jebelia camp in October and November [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=150.04000000000002s)]
*  I was trying to even to call my grandfather who was just a few blocks away from me to check on him with it [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=155.24s)]
*  I mean my grandfather passed away in April. He was sick. There was no ambulance [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=159.60000000000002s)]
*  There was no even phone signal to call the doctors [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=163.20000000000002s)]
*  So even while I was in Gaza, we were struggling to connect with people even people in South Gaza [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=165.76000000000002s)]
*  They started even to connect with their families who are left behind in North Gaza [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=170.2s)]
*  But I mean it's very difficult to get in touch [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=174.04s)]
*  sometimes I have to spend about an hour in order to catch the line and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=176.95999999999998s)]
*  That's what happened with my sister and also other sisters in the past 13 months [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  But for ten days, I haven't been able to to talk to my sister and North Gaza [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=185.23999999999998s)]
*  I know that you like I would say I think everyone in Gaza have lost many people that you know [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=190.0s)]
*  I want to just read something that you wrote on Instagram [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=196.6s)]
*  You said I write with a heavy heart my cousin Sama seven years old has been killed in the airstrike on their house along [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=201.48s)]
*  With 18 members of her family, which is my extended family [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=206.35999999999999s)]
*  And the house was a grandmother Fatima who was my grandmother's sister [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=209.56s)]
*  She was killed too with two of her daughters and their children. I posted about this yesterday before the house was bombed [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=212.76s)]
*  I told everyone that tanks and soldiers were besieging the area, but no one heard no one did anything to save them [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=217.39999999999998s)]
*  I took this picture of someone June 2022. It was it [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=221.56s)]
*  First of all, I'm so horribly. Sorry [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=225.72s)]
*  How [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=230.6s)]
*  How are you processing the level of? [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=231.92s)]
*  Loss that you and everyone there has been through you know Chris. There is nothing that's called processing [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=235.27999999999997s)]
*  The trauma because we have never exited the trauma period. I mean I lost my [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=243.79999999999998s)]
*  31 members of my extended family in October last year including my first cousin to Harir with her husband [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=251.08s)]
*  Mujahid and their five children and then a few days later [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=256.52s)]
*  I lost another first cousin of mine [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=259.56s)]
*  Nourish and tough with her husband and their three children and then my mother my wife lost her uncle who was born deaf and mute [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=261.84s)]
*  He was taken by the Israelis and by the time he arrived at the school gate [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=268.72s)]
*  When he was released he tried to return to the school which is now of course burned by the Israelis by the time [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=272.32s)]
*  He arrived at the gate [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=277.62s)]
*  He was shot by a sniper and then I lost my friend riff at all are here and then I lost some of my students [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=278.7s)]
*  the latter that the last the last of which of whom was [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=284.54s)]
*  had [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=289.26s)]
*  Nain with his father [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=290.3s)]
*  I mean just man he what he lived in Bethan in North Gaza and he left North Gaza because the Israelis [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=291.86s)]
*  Ordered the people in North Gaza to go to go south [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=299.42s)]
*  Yesterday it's five days ago. He was killed with his father in Dar el-Balah, South Gaza [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=303.06s)]
*  So if you are wondering why people are not leaving North Gaza, it's because it when they go south my friend is my lab [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=307.62s)]
*  I'm going to read a poem about his sister who is still under the rubble since last November [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=312.9s)]
*  They left North Gaza in October [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=317.34000000000003s)]
*  2023 after the Israeli campaign started they went to an essay that and [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=321.42s)]
*  Last October last November Ismail his two children his three of his sisters and his parents were killed in one air strike [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=326.26s)]
*  And the body of Ismail his father and his sister Ikram 15 years old are still under the rubble until this moment [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=332.94s)]
*  So I can't I'm not processing any of this. I'm not pressing. I'm still living it. I'm just hung in the air [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=339.71999999999997s)]
*  I don't know whether I would be snatched up or I would be pulled down. I'm still somewhere in between [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=346.42s)]
*  Will you read the poem that you mentioned sure so this poem is about? [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=352.7s)]
*  Ikram [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=356.62s)]
*  My friend Ismail's sister 15 years old and this is this is also a poem [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=357.86s)]
*  About all the people whose bodies remain under the rubble [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=363.70000000000005s)]
*  Right or left [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=368.78000000000003s)]
*  Under the rubble her body has remained for days and days [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=371.26000000000005s)]
*  When the war ends we try to remove the rubble stone after stone [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=376.18s)]
*  We only find one small bone from her body it is a bone from her arm [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=382.5s)]
*  Right or left it does not matter as long as we as long as we cannot find the henna [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=389.54s)]
*  From her neighbors wedding on her skin or the ink from a school pen on the little index finger [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=396.26s)]
*  When you mentioned the henna on the wedding [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=405.9s)]
*  I want you to just talk a little bit about one of the things that I've struggled with in covering this is that the [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=407.74s)]
*  devastation in Gaza is so [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=413.21999999999997s)]
*  Constant and the images are so horrific and constant [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=415.3s)]
*  It can feel apocalyptic in a way that that that that erases from people's conception that this was a place that people [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=419.21999999999997s)]
*  lived and laughed and loved and went and got coffee and [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=425.82s)]
*  Had graduations and weddings and all these things and you write in the you write poems and in essays about your life in Gaza [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=429.18s)]
*  before yeah, and [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=435.53999999999996s)]
*  What it was like I? [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=437.74s)]
*  Mean we had a really beautiful life despite the occupation despite the sea the siege [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=439.26s)]
*  I mean of course we are the people who will not give up [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=444.42s)]
*  Despite everything and when we try to make something beautiful out of our lives some people some racist people say oh [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=448.21999999999997s)]
*  How do you claim it is a siege? [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=454.18s)]
*  How do you claim you are under occupation and you for example my my older brother is a bodybuilder and a weightlifter? [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=455.46s)]
*  And I posted a photo of him just a few months ago [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=460.78s)]
*  You know posing for in a competition and someone said oh, how do you claim? [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=463.66s)]
*  There is a siege and your brother had food to build this body. I mean no we had gyms. We had football clubs [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=467.98s)]
*  We had soccer clubs. We had schools. We had universities. We have I mean we had poets [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=474.58000000000004s)]
*  We had ambassadors to other countries from the Gaza Strip and we have the most beautiful part of Gaza is the sea [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=479.58000000000004s)]
*  The beach it is the only place [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=486.61999999999995s)]
*  Where I could send my eyes without anything that's blocking my eyes [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=488.97999999999996s)]
*  But then there is there are the Israeli gunboats and the Israeli warships [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=493.03999999999996s)]
*  One of the things that be many people don't know is that I as a Palestinian from Gaza has never seen my country [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=497.94s)]
*  Palestine or even the Gaza Strip or even the refugee camp where I grew up from the sky on a window [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=505.21999999999997s)]
*  In a from a window on a plane [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=510.46s)]
*  I've never seen Gaza the Gaza Strip or any other parts of Palestine from from the sea. I've never traveled [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=512.22s)]
*  through the sea [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=519.3000000000001s)]
*  There want to see my country [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=521.22s)]
*  there is [[00:08:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=523.5s)]
*  Talk of more regional escalation. In fact, we may have early reports of Israeli airstrikes in Tehran in Iran [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=525.22s)]
*  We don't know that yet, but there's an anticipation [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=532.78s)]
*  There will be obviously there's airstrikes in Lebanon and and ground troops invasion Lebanon [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=535.0600000000001s)]
*  And of course what's happening in the northern half of the Gaza Strip is among the more brutal periods of the wars as best [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=539.78s)]
*  As we can piece together from the reports that have gotten out [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=545.78s)]
*  Do you think about an after do you think about a [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=550.66s)]
*  does it [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=554.74s)]
*  What what comes after I? [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=556.1s)]
*  Think that this question should be asked to the people who divided my country into two parts in 1947 [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=558.54s)]
*  The partition plan why and this is a question everyone should be thinking about why when the partition plan was was adopted [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=564.82s)]
*  No, why no one stopped and say okay. Let's talk about the day after what will happen after the partition plan [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=572.22s)]
*  What what will happen after the Palestinians lose? [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=577.3s)]
*  55% of their land no one thought about that, but they continued and now do they have a state and we don't have a state [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=582.1800000000001s)]
*  We are not recognized. I mean I see friends know now caring about the Palestinian lives [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=588.58s)]
*  And they they don't even say okay [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=593.46s)]
*  We are going to recognize the Palestinian state as a response to what's happening or the UK they are not doing anything [[00:09:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=595.38s)]
*  so I don't want people to [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=599.98s)]
*  To sympathize with us as victims because this is something that I do with everyone if I see someone suffering [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=603.58s)]
*  I would sympathize with them what I need is a recognition that I am a human being who have their own political rights their economic [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=609.7s)]
*  Rights everything I'm a human being with the rights no one recognizes us as a political [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=616.4200000000001s)]
*  Entities they just recognize us as wounded people and people who need some food [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=621.54s)]
*  I mean come on [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=625.9399999999999s)]
*  I mean this has been going on for 76 years or more and we have been looked at just as victims during the wars [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=627.34s)]
*  This is where the cameras when the when the cameras come to Gaza and the West Bank [[00:10:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=633.9399999999999s)]
*  So what if you could as as a full human being embodied with political rights? [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=638.9399999999999s)]
*  If you could wave a magic wand to create what the correct [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=644.98s)]
*  Settlement would be [[00:10:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=649.66s)]
*  Again, this is a question that I can I can answer as a grant as a grandson of a refugee [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=651.54s)]
*  But the best one to answer this question [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=657.14s)]
*  It would be my grandfather was expect expelled from Yaffa along with 800,000 Palestinians [[00:10:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=658.82s)]
*  My grandparents were expelled from Yaffa in 1948 [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=663.62s)]
*  So I would ask them a question this question because it was their home which should which could be my home in Yaffa [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=666.14s)]
*  I would ask him. I mean, how do you imagine? [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=671.74s)]
*  Living in a country as a human being I would ask them this question [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=675.0999999999999s)]
*  But if you ask me now as a Palestinian who survived [[00:11:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=679.4599999999999s)]
*  The genocide so far and I will I survived an airstrike in 2009. I was a 16 year old kid [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=683.06s)]
*  I got two pieces of shnavda in my body and still have the traces of the shabnil. I [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=689.02s)]
*  mean if you ask if you ask me about [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=694.2199999999999s)]
*  What a future would be for the Palestinians I would imagine it a future that everyone would accept as their own future [[00:11:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=697.9799999999999s)]
*  I would come and ask the American people the European people. I mean if you were born in a refugee camp if you have your country [[00:11:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=704.42s)]
*  Devastated by the occupation and by this about by the siege. What would be your hope? [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=712.2199999999999s)]
*  I would like to to have a life that is similar if not better [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=715.9s)]
*  Similar to the to the lives of the people who live outside [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=723.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean I'm living in Syracuse with my with my wife and kids and it's a beautiful life. It has it's very quiet [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=726.74s)]
*  If there is no in Syracuse, of course, but I mean it's very quiet [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=733.7s)]
*  You get everything you need you can buy a car you can take a loan from a bank [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=736.1800000000001s)]
*  You can meet your friends you can travel whenever you want to return return on your own [[00:12:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=739.62s)]
*  But this is something that I've never had when I was in Gaza. I couldn't leave Gaza when I wanted [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=742.74s)]
*  I told you I left Gaza for the first time when I was 27 years old [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=747.7s)]
*  Can you imagine this and I see people here in the states traveling with their kids who are one year old or still? [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=751.38s)]
*  Babies, you know and take their dogs on the plane and I can't I don't have an airport in my country [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=757.02s)]
*  I don't have a seaport [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=762.64s)]
*  It's not only about not being able to leave Gaza, but it's also about not having guests right to visit Gaza to see my country [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=763.84s)]
*  I want to show you my country Chris. I can't you can't come together [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wdtZbmOZWAE&t=770.24s)]
