# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights July 17
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 18, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI)
*  Later tonight, we're going to hear from Ohio Senator JD Vance as he addresses the country as Trump's vice presidential pick today in his first [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=0.0s)]
*  campaign appearance in that position Vance called his running mate Donald Trump a real leader and a great president [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=7.4s)]
*  We're gonna hear much more of that later tonight [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=13.280000000000001s)]
*  But we do not expect to hear any more of this kind of stuff tonight critical comments [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=15.64s)]
*  That's made about Trump when he ran for president the first time in 2016 [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=19.900000000000002s)]
*  Here's a sampling I go back and forth between thinking Trump is a cynical a-hole like Nixon [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=23.92s)]
*  Who wouldn't be that bad and might even prove useful or that Trump is America's Hitler? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=28.92s)]
*  The guy JD Vance wrote that text to his old Yale Law School roommate and current Georgia State Senator Josh McLaurin [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=34.2s)]
*  Joins us now a state senator McLaurin. Thanks for spending a little time with us this evening [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=41.28s)]
*  The first thing I got to ask you is you know in your time in the Ivy Leagues [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=46.24s)]
*  With with JD Vance. Did you get any inkling of the deep? [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=51.52s)]
*  Disgust he apparently has for Ivy League intellectuals who he now believes are part of a regime that has developed an economic [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=56.7s)]
*  Platform that is distinctly at odds with what is good for quote-unquote real America [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=64.62s)]
*  Did you sense that kind of I'll call it populism when you were rooming with him in the Ivy Leagues? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=69.5s)]
*  Hi, Alex and Chris a great to join you. I mean in a word. Yes, but it was limited, right? [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=75.06s)]
*  I mean so much of this MAGA stuff is performance, right? [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=79.9s)]
*  You have to choose to really lay it on thick but it may come from you know, some legitimate gripes or anger that some voters have [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=83.22000000000001s)]
*  I mean there's anger on both sides, but it's a choice to turn that into [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=90.02000000000001s)]
*  Contempt and I think that that's what JD has been doing ever since getting into politics and why he's such an effective communicator and amplifier [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=93.38000000000001s)]
*  For the MAGA movement, but at the time in 2010, I really liked him at first. I think a lot of people did too [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=100.66000000000001s)]
*  He's charismatic one-on-one. He's intelligent and he had thoughtful things to say about conservative positions [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=106.66000000000001s)]
*  Like he didn't just echo all of the unlimited gun rights talking points [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=113.14s)]
*  For example, he once told me he thought the Second Amendment was a paradox because it's law [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=116.42s)]
*  But it's also you know preserving the right of people maybe to overthrow their government, which is inconsistent with law and order [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=120.74s)]
*  So, I mean he was thoughtful about things like that [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=126.22s)]
*  But you know, he was skeptical of the law school environment [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=128.82s)]
*  That's one of the reasons he and I didn't get along so well as the years went by or really the months [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=131.26s)]
*  I mean we figured out quickly but then into the foreseeable future is that he had a very [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=135.38s)]
*  Caustic and sarcastic sense of humor about the law school and some of the people there and I mean I ran the comedy show [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=139.54s)]
*  A law school so I was trying to have maybe a good time [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=145.16s)]
*  So I think what we're seeing now is that anger that he had maybe from childhood who knows it kind of doesn't matter [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=147.74s)]
*  He is now taking that anger and saying he wants to impose that bad feeling that contempt on the whole country [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=153.34s)]
*  Because of his great distrust for and the caricature that he's made out of media the left whatever his political opponents might be [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=160.3s)]
*  You know you received that text where he calls Trump potentially America's Hitler [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=167.46s)]
*  He's now the running mate to a man. He called potentially America's Hitler [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=172.42000000000002s)]
*  Does that I mean I understand the anger and the contempt and the the grievous rage [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=177.10000000000002s)]
*  But but to see your values it sounds like if you're someone who's skeptical of the Second Amendment [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=181.94s)]
*  You know standing in line with Trump shoulder to shoulder. I mean does that make sense? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=187.14000000000001s)]
*  Does that comport with the person you once knew it's a staggering 180? [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=191.9s)]
*  I mean, we all know it doesn't make sense, right? [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=196.78s)]
*  So then we're all like grasping to explain it and you can imagine [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=198.38s)]
*  I've had a lot of conversations with old friends and new about this moment [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=200.86s)]
*  And the thing that keeps coming up is when you think that your opponent is evil or you think your opponent is worthy of contempt [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=204.86s)]
*  Then your principles don't really matter anymore [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=212.14000000000001s)]
*  If you the bigger you make your enemy into the more cartoonish your enemy is whatever principles or thoughtfulness you might have had [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=214.14000000000001s)]
*  You can just throw those by the wayside because it's justified by that contempt [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=220.26000000000002s)]
*  And so I think what we've seen with him is he had a gut reaction like so many of us did to Trump [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=224.26s)]
*  He said this guy's clearly like narcissistic. He's a fraud. I mean he was saying that Trump was a fraud all the way until 2021 [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=228.84s)]
*  You know, there's recently unearthed audio to that effect. So it's not like he doesn't get it. He was very insightful [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=235.42s)]
*  I mean the text he sent me said the Trump was [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=240.22s)]
*  the the fruit of collective neglect by the Republican Party who was ignoring the working class and that he was a demagogue who was [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=243.3s)]
*  Exploiting the failures of his party that is sophisticated analysis that still holds true [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=249.85999999999999s)]
*  I think that's what makes him more than just an ordinary flip-flopper, right? [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=254.66s)]
*  Like plenty of Republican elected officials were against Trump before they were for Trump [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=258.06s)]
*  And I think that's why the campaign is trying to treat it like old news [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=261.98s)]
*  But JD's different and I think more dangerous because rather than just be an empty suit who's sort of parroting MAGA talking points [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=264.78s)]
*  I think that he has let his anger really take over his life and make him convinced that Trump is the right choice for America [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=271.1s)]
*  I don't think he's going home and having a whiskey and putting his feet up and saying oh man that Trump guy is crazy [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=278.3s)]
*  But I have to defend him on TV [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=283.42s)]
*  I think he's at this point so angry so motivated by that that spirit of revenge that Trump has publicly espoused [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=284.74s)]
*  That he's the perfect running mate for Trump [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=292.06s)]
*  Which I've said recently and also that he he's really amplifying the the MAGA moment and doubling down instead of being a more moderate pick [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=294.06s)]
*  Yeah that on that last point [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=302.06s)]
*  I spent the last few days doing a lot of reading of JD Vance interviews with him things that he's written [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=303.94s)]
*  some of the profiles of him a lot of his social media production and my [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=310.26s)]
*  thesis from afar is that he he has [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=314.82s)]
*  Radicalized himself that whatever began as opportunism a sort of plant growing towards the light as it were [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=319.18s)]
*  This is obviously the path to power and status in the Republican Party [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=324.96s)]
*  That's obviously inseparable from this but that he's a true believer in all this in the same way that like we've watched Elon Musk [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=329.52s)]
*  Basically self radicalized in real time online [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=335.56s)]
*  We've watched a bunch of these people do this and that I'm just curious what you think of that as a theory because I think [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=338.59999999999997s)]
*  A lot of it's about the opportunism that we've been hearing but to me [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=343.76s)]
*  I see someone who is fully committed to this agenda when he says to a Vanity Fair [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=346.59999999999997s)]
*  Reporter the president should fire every mid-level bureaucrat and then defy the Supreme Court when they strike it down. I don't think that's posture [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=350.88s)]
*  Yeah, I agree. I mean I think you can think of it in addition to being opportunism for his political advancement [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=358.59999999999997s)]
*  It's also opportunism to be a jerk, right? I mean, that's why I tweeted recently [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=364.4s)]
*  I think that this is a triumph for angry jerks everywhere [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=368.0s)]
*  I really mean that because even if JD is just mostly angry on TV [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=370.36s)]
*  He is creating the same permission structure that Trump has spent years creating which is [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=374.47999999999996s)]
*  Ordinary Americans can show contempt towards one another and nothing will happen to you, right? [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=379.08s)]
*  It's like what you hear about in schools bullying increasing this moment being deleterious for the whole country's culture [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=382.78000000000003s)]
*  So I think that JD is he really either underestimates or doesn't care the effect of this type of contempt spilling over [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=388.5s)]
*  into [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=396.58s)]
*  Everyday life and further deteriorating our political culture [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=397.58s)]
*  I agree with you that I think that he has drunk the Kool-Aid [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=401.66s)]
*  Wholesale because that's the way to motivate his sincerity when he brings that kind of anger to his messaging [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=404.94s)]
*  It's one way to motivate sincerity just sheer contempt and rage [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=410.53999999999996s)]
*  Georgia State Senator Joshua McLaurin. Thanks for really providing some very helpful analysis and perspective really appreciate it. Oh, thank you [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=415.21999999999997s)]
*  I'm gonna be live tweeting in frustration later on our caucus Twitter cap [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=422.7s)]
*  G a Senate Dems in case you guys won't follow along but it's really been an honor to join you. Thank you [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=425.85999999999996s)]
*  Thanks for joining us there and Senator Mark Kelly Democrat of Arizona joins us now Senator Kelly [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=429.62s)]
*  I just want to first get your reaction as you are in the Senate and we are hearing some reports from ABC News [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=434.98s)]
*  To some degree confirmed by our sources with NBC News [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=441.46s)]
*  That Chuck Schumer the majority leader had a one-on-one conversation with President Biden in [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=445.26s)]
*  Delaware on Saturday where he [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=451.34s)]
*  It appears it sounds like took the concerns of his caucus to the president and suggested he needed to step down [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=454.3s)]
*  What is your reaction to that? [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=461.02s)]
*  Well, I just heard that today and [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=463.41999999999996s)]
*  We've had meetings with Senator Schumer over the last couple weeks, you know talking about this issue [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=465.94s)]
*  But I think the reality of the situation is that President Biden and Kamala Harris are our nominees [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=471.29999999999995s)]
*  millions of Americans voted for them across the country and you know 50 states and territories and we have an election in [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=478.7s)]
*  110 days and we've got to be focused on that [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=486.46s)]
*  We got to make sure that we work as hard as possible [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=489.66s)]
*  Not make any mistakes here. And if we do that, I'm confident that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris can be reelected [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=492.1s)]
*  Do you think that's the view of your fellow Democrats in the Senate as well? [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=498.7s)]
*  Well, I'm not gonna get into you know our internal discussions and I'm not gonna speak, you know for my colleagues [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=503.14s)]
*  I will say that there are differing views [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=509.22s)]
*  Let me ask you this senator [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=512.98s)]
*  We were just discussing of course the assassination attempt which just happened a few days ago in Butler, Pennsylvania [[00:08:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=514.78s)]
*  Obviously your wife Gabby Giffords was was shot and and previously wounded [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=521.54s)]
*  When serving as a United States congressperson, you know firsthand the effects of both gun violence and political violence [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=527.54s)]
*  What it what it does even just at the human level. I am curious to hear [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=534.06s)]
*  How you've reacted to this news what it what it how it landed in in your household when it's [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=539.5799999999999s)]
*  so close [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=545.02s)]
*  Well, it's certainly for me it brought back, you know memories from you know those days [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=546.86s)]
*  You know the the day that Gabby was shot as you said she was serving in Congress. She was meeting with her constituents [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=551.86s)]
*  She was a member of Congress at the time. I was an astronaut. I'd flown a few space shuttle missions [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=558.38s)]
*  I flew 39 missions in combat [[00:09:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=564.06s)]
*  But as it would turn out my wife Gabby Giffords was the person who had the dangerous job [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=566.3s)]
*  And it's sad to think that this continues. I mean that was 13 years ago and today we still have this kind of political violence [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=572.82s)]
*  I really feel for the president former president and his family [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=580.34s)]
*  Certainly for the family members of the firefighter that was killed that day [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=584.98s)]
*  There is no place in our society for this kind of violence. Do you us? [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=588.74s)]
*  Senator sorry, it's Alex Wagner again [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=594.62s)]
*  Sort of an assessment of how the Republican Party has grappled with the attempted assassination of its ticket leader [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=597.3s)]
*  And do you have you gotten anything? [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=605.06s)]
*  I think as someone who's experienced it yourself and has feelings about it and has processed it [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=607.0999999999999s)]
*  You know, what do you make of how the GOP is is grappling with it on whole? [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=611.8599999999999s)]
*  Well, I mean having experienced this myself. I know it's got to be shocking for them [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=617.02s)]
*  I mean to think that this could happen and I'm thankful [[00:10:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=621.2199999999999s)]
*  That the shooter was not successful, you know, the the president former president got was extremely lucky here and [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=625.14s)]
*  Was only slightly injured [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=632.54s)]
*  But we have an election [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=635.02s)]
*  Coming up and we've got a tone down the rhetoric. I was on Capitol Hill on January 6 [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=637.06s)]
*  and [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=643.9399999999999s)]
*  When the former president through political speech sent a mob up there to interfere with the peaceful [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=644.98s)]
*  Transition of power and [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=652.7399999999999s)]
*  You know that shouldn't be something that's tolerated in our society and I'm concerned if this continues [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=655.18s)]
*  That we could have somebody additional people injured or killed [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=663.66s)]
*  So I think it's on all of us to try to tone down the rhetoric to focus on the election [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=667.3399999999999s)]
*  Which is a very patriotic thing that happens every two or four years in our country [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=672.66s)]
*  And we've got to resolve our differences at the ballot box one thing that really concerns me [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=678.6999999999999s)]
*  Alex is that with the selection of JD Vance you have somebody that is only in that position [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=683.3399999999999s)]
*  as the vice presidential candidate because of his loyalty his loyalty to Donald Trump and that he would do what Mike Pence [[00:11:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=690.54s)]
*  Refused to do which is to change the outcome of the election and then you add on top of that his [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=698.9399999999999s)]
*  His issues that he has with women reproductive rights, which I'd be happy to get into you in more detail [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=706.2199999999999s)]
*  I'm really concerned that that JD Vance could be a heartbeat away from the presidency [[00:11:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=712.5799999999999s)]
*  Senator I'm glad you brought up JD Vance [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=719.3399999999999s)]
*  JD Vance was one of two Senate candidates in the last cycle that were heavily backed by right-wing billionaire Peter Thiel [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=722.18s)]
*  There's kind of a group of people Elon Musk Peter Thiel David Sacks and others [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=729.18s)]
*  This kind of very right-wing [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=733.98s)]
*  Tech billionaires. Yeah, Chris. The other one was my opponent [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=736.58s)]
*  That's exactly what I was gonna ask you you learn something because you got [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=740.3000000000001s)]
*  Millions of dollars dropped on your head on behalf of Blake Masters who you defeated and right I know what you learned from that race [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=743.3800000000001s)]
*  Well, they're very similar. I mean, I know these guys. I mean JD Vance wants a total abortion ban [[00:12:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=749.2600000000001s)]
*  I mean total abortion ban and when asked about [[00:12:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=754.8000000000001s)]
*  exceptions for rape and interest and and incest [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=759.0200000000001s)]
*  I mean, what do they say said two wrongs don't make a right? [[00:12:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=761.5799999999999s)]
*  I mean, when is it wrong for a woman who has been raped to to want to terminate a pregnancy? [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=764.5799999999999s)]
*  You know any and he said these these were just [[00:12:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=772.02s)]
*  Inconveniences that the fact that a woman could be pregnant after being raped [[00:12:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=775.66s)]
*  I mean an inconvenience is when you get stuck in traffic on your way home from work. Yeah, I have two daughters [[00:13:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=780.38s)]
*  I have a granddaughter. I'm really concerned about [[00:13:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=786.54s)]
*  JD Vance being a heartbeat away from the presidency and also just as vice president being involved in decision-making [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=790.3s)]
*  That can affect my kids. I mean this guy voted against [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=796.62s)]
*  protections for birth control and IVF and [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=800.7s)]
*  I mean, he's also when he talks about social security and Medicare talks about how this is a roadblock. I [[00:13:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=804.62s)]
*  Mean those programs are lifelines for millions of seniors across our country [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=812.54s)]
*  Senator I wonder if you could talk a little bit about what you envision in terms of MAGA 2.0 [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=818.26s)]
*  If JD Vance is the vice president and he comes from or he is rooted in a form of conservatism that almost makes MAGA look [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=823.62s)]
*  moderate in some ways [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=831.7s)]
*  Well, I think with anything 2.0 is usually worse than 1.0 [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=833.9000000000001s)]
*  So I mean I would expect this thing to eventually will go off the rails [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=837.98s)]
*  but I think what the American people need to recognize is [[00:14:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=842.1400000000001s)]
*  You know that their their freedoms and their rights are at stake here in this election on November 5th [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=845.54s)]
*  You know, we've got to get our voters out showing up [[00:14:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=853.26s)]
*  To make sure that Joe Biden and Kamala Harris are reelected [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=856.78s)]
*  I am really concerned about our future with four more years of Donald Trump in the White House [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=860.42s)]
*  And then what could come come after that with with possibly with JD Vance [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=865.78s)]
*  Senator Mark Kelly [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AifEo45twlI&t=870.54s)]
