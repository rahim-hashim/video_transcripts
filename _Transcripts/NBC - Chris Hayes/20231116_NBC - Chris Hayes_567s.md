# ‘Repellant’: Elon Musk’s ‘shocking pronouncement of antisemitism’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 16, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. One of the most distressing elements of these anguishing past 41 days since the horrific events of October 7th and the start of the brutal and bloody war between Israel and Hamas is the marked rise in anti-Semitic incidents around the world and right here in the U.S. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=0.0s)]
*  The Anti-Defamation League's Center on Extremism documented 832 anti-Semitic incidents of assault, vandalism, and harassment in the U.S. in just four weeks following the attack. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=17.0s)]
*  It comes out to an average of nearly 28 incidents per day and represents a 316% increase over the same period last year. You could just see it, I mean, in any city you live. Just here in New York City, anti-Semitic hate crimes surged 214% in the month of October. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=28.0s)]
*  Across the country, we've seen synagogues and Jewish schools, Jewish centers, even a Jewish cemetery defaced, vandalized. People have torn down flyers bringing attention to the more than 220 hostages kidnapped by Hamas on October 7th. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=46.0s)]
*  A lot of these incidents have taken place under cover of night or behind the relative anonymity of a screen. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=63.0s)]
*  But yesterday, the wealthiest man in the world made one of the most shocking public pronouncements of anti-Semitism I've seen, and he did it on the platform that he owns. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=69.0s)]
*  I'm speaking, of course, of Elon Musk, the founder of SpaceX and Tesla, who purchased Twitter last year, changed his name, and promptly managed to lose $25 billion on it. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=81.0s)]
*  Musk brought his hard-right views to the platform where he elevated the most loathsome offensive bigots. He welcomed back outright and avowed neo-Nazis who'd been banned from the website. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=93.0s)]
*  He's defended white supremacists, complained about racism against white people. He compared Jewish billionaire George Soros to a Jewish Marvel supervillain. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=105.0s)]
*  With Elon Musk's attention and encouragement, those with the most despicable views have essentially taken over the platform now known as X. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=115.0s)]
*  This is a man with enormous power and influence well beyond the internet. He's one of the most powerful private citizens in the world. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=125.0s)]
*  Just yesterday, Musk attended a cocktail hour with Chinese President Xi Jinping that followed the bilateral meeting with President Joe Biden. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=131.0s)]
*  Musk also has the ear of top U.S. officials who welcome him like royalty anytime he descends on Washington. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=139.0s)]
*  And so it's this man who took to his website yesterday to endorse the most violent, dangerous anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=146.0s)]
*  Now it all began with a person who describes himself as a Jewish conservative expressing his anger about that recent rise of anti-Semitism. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=153.0s)]
*  He addresses the quote, [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=161.0s)]
*  Cowards hiding behind the anonymity of the internet and posting Hitler was right and calls for them to step out of the shadows and quote, [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=163.0s)]
*  Say it to our faces. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=170.0s)]
*  And that prompted a reply from another user who wrote, [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=172.0s)]
*  Okay, right, responding. Okay, say it to your faces. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=175.0s)]
*  People think Hitler is right. Okay, I'll talk to you. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=179.0s)]
*  Jewish communities have been pushing the exact kind of dialectical hatred against whites. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=182.0s)]
*  They claim to want people to stop using against them. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=187.0s)]
*  You want truth said your face. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=190.0s)]
*  There it is. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=192.0s)]
*  I wish I could say this was a fringe view, but is a vile and over century old anti-Semitic conspiracy theory. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=194.0s)]
*  Basically, the Jewish people in coordination with people of color are a kind of conspiracy to assault whiteness. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=201.0s)]
*  And in fact, that Jews are behind this conspiracy. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=210.0s)]
*  This same conspiracy, which is sort of come to be known as the Great Replacement Theory that Jews are are the sort of puppet masters manipulating American immigration policy to replace white people. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=215.0s)]
*  This has permeated into a large swath of the American right. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=225.0s)]
*  We saw it in Charlottesville, most infamously in the 2017 where the marchers chanted Jews will not replace us. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=229.0s)]
*  It was this view that was the inspiration for the perpetrator of the horrific anti-Semitic mass murder at the Tree of Life Synagogue in 2018. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=237.0s)]
*  The killer said so himself. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=248.0s)]
*  So Elon Musk, the richest man in the world, one of the most powerful influential men in the world, the owner of this platform, replied to the post, espousing that vile theory, [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=252.0s)]
*  replied to this post that replied to someone calling out those who think Hitler is right and said, OK, he says this to the guy that said that theory. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=261.0s)]
*  You have said the actual truth, the actual truth. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=270.0s)]
*  Jews coordinating this assault on whiteness. [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=276.0s)]
*  So shocking and repellent that Elon Musk, a man of the highest echelons of our society, would not just say something like that, but actually believe it. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=281.0s)]
*  It's a reminder that anti-Semitism is dangerous and enduring even at the very highest levels of American society. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=289.0s)]
*  And we should be clear, there's a real history of this in this country. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=295.0s)]
*  Many notable, powerful American figures through the ages were just rank anti-Semites. [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=299.0s)]
*  Probably the most notorious example is actually a man who's probably the closest historical analog to Elon Musk in many ways, Henry Ford. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=307.0s)]
*  Of course, Ford was the founder of the Ford Motor Company, the perfector of assembly line production, one of the wealthiest and most influential men of the earliest 20th century, one of the great industrialists of the world history. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=316.0s)]
*  And he was also, as many people know, an anti-Semite. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=328.0s)]
*  But the zealousness, the viciousness with which he pursued that cause of hating Jews, the cause of global persecution of Jewish people, that I think has been a bit under emphasized in our collective recollection. [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=332.0s)]
*  It's not an asterisk to Henry Ford's legacy. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=349.0s)]
*  It's right at the center. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=352.0s)]
*  In fact, before the rise of Adolf Hitler, Henry Ford was probably the most powerful anti-Semite in the world. [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=355.0s)]
*  This is a topic of Rachel Maddow's remarkable new book, Prequel, about fascist sympathizers in the United States around World War II and those who defeated them. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=362.0s)]
*  And this past weekend, I got a chance to speak with Rachel for a live episode of my podcast, Why Is This Happening? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=372.0s)]
*  And she read us an excerpt about Henry Ford's story. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=379.0s)]
*  He was one of the most successful and celebrated industrialists on the planet. His anti-Semitism was rank and it was unchecked. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=384.0s)]
*  He spewed it freely in private tirades among friends, family, close business cohorts, newspaper reporters, or pretty much anybody within earshot. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=392.0s)]
*  Ford was hardly the only radical anti-Semite in the U.S. circa 1920, but in addition to his fortune and his famous name and his iconic company, he had a megaphone your average crazy uncle theorizer lacked. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=401.0s)]
*  He had Twitter. No, I'm kidding. Sorry. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=413.0s)]
*  Sorry. It's X. I'm supposed to say X. Yeah. Sorry. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=417.0s)]
*  He had a newspaper. It was called the Dearborn Independent. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=423.0s)]
*  Every week for 92 weeks, headlines like these, the international Jew, the world's problem, and Jewish jazz moron music becomes our national music. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=426.0s)]
*  And this one, the perils of baseball, too much Jew. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=439.0s)]
*  His headlines were splashed onto the pages of Ford's paper, which was distributed in Ford dealerships across the country. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=445.0s)]
*  Ford also sought of the publication of his series in book form. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=451.0s)]
*  It was titled the International Jew. [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=454.0s)]
*  It ran to four volumes. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=457.0s)]
*  The German edition of Ford's book had landed in the hands of one particularly gifted propagandist. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=459.0s)]
*  When Adolf Hitler's book Mein Kampf was published in 1925, the author appeared to lift not just ideas, but whole passages from Ford's own publications. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=464.0s)]
*  Mein Kampf's first edition extolled Ford by name. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=475.0s)]
*  When a reporter from the Detroit News showed up at Nazi Party headquarters in Munich in December 1931 to interview Hitler, she had a series that was called Five Minutes with Men in Public Eye. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=479.0s)]
*  And she had her five minutes with Hitler. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=491.0s)]
*  When she went to Hitler's office, she was surprised to find hanging on the wall behind Hitler's desk, a large framed portrait of a very famous American. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=495.0s)]
*  Hitler explained to the newspaper woman, I regard Henry Ford as my inspiration. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=505.0s)]
*  Wild, right? Didn't know it until I read the book. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=512.0s)]
*  That was just part of our wide ranging two hour conversation. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=515.0s)]
*  If you want to hear more, you're in luck. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=518.0s)]
*  The incredible with pod episode will be streaming exclusively on Peacock starting this Friday, November 17th. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=520.0s)]
*  Now, to be clear, Elon Musk is not at the Henry Ford level yet. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=525.0s)]
*  There are real warning signs emanating from one of the world's most powerful men and from society at large. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=532.0s)]
*  Anti-Semitism is on the rise. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=538.0s)]
*  It's real. It's dangerous. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=540.0s)]
*  In the case of Elon Musk, it is just staring us in the face. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=542.0s)]
*  You [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Awr5uHZQ2lk&t=562.0s)]
