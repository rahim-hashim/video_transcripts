# ‘She’s a free spirit!’: Trump defends relationship with far-right racist Laura Loomer
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 13, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=0.0s)]
*  You know, one of the weird advantages Donald Trump seems to enjoy in his campaign for president [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=2.32s)]
*  is that a lot of Americans have blocked out what it was really like living through Trump's last year, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  particularly in the White House, when he was downplaying and mismanaging the worst public health crisis in a century [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=12.84s)]
*  and calling for cops and soldiers to dominate Americans protesting police violence and racism. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=19.36s)]
*  And then, of course, he lost his bid for reelection by more than 7 million votes [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=25.0s)]
*  and decided to pretend that he didn't, inciting his supporters to try and stop the peaceful transfer of power, [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=29.439999999999998s)]
*  leading to an insurrection and the worst assaults on the U.S. Capitol since the War of 1812. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=35.76s)]
*  And through it all, one of the things became clear was that Trump is, well, we know this, [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=41.24s)]
*  a person with narcissistic and sociopathic impulses who should be nowhere near the halls of power. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=45.44s)]
*  Those impulses also mean it matters intensely who is around him. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=51.44s)]
*  When you lack character, you're a poor judge of character. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=57.68s)]
*  Nowhere was that more obvious than in Trump's attempt to steal the election [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=61.52s)]
*  with the aid of a stunning cast of not ready for prime time players. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=65.56s)]
*  What we are really dealing with here and uncovering more by the day [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=71.52s)]
*  is the massive influence of communist money through Venezuela, Cuba and likely China. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=76.48s)]
*  Our votes are counted in Germany and in Spain by a company owned by affiliates of Chavez and Maduro. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=85.24s)]
*  We aren't going to let this election be stolen by Joe Biden and the Democrats. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=95.11999999999999s)]
*  President Trump won by a landslide. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=99.64s)]
*  He could take military capabilities and he could place them in those states [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=101.6s)]
*  and basically rerun an election in each of those states. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=105.72s)]
*  They were convicted and pardoned criminals like Michael Flynn and Roger Stone, [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=110.11999999999999s)]
*  the MyPillow guy, the Overstock.com guy, Rudy Giuliani, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Sidney Powell, [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=113.76s)]
*  the attorney whose meritless lawsuits and conspiracy theories didn't release the crack in so much as incriminate her and jeopardize her law license. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=120.28s)]
*  Jeffrey Clark, who proposed to take over the Justice Department and use it to bolster Trump's fake accounts of election fraud [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=128.52s)]
*  and who ended up having his house raided for election interference while he stood in his driveway in his underwear. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=134.92000000000002s)]
*  All those people empowered Trump and worked to facilitate an attempted coup, even while, let's remember, [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=141.68s)]
*  other people in the White House, like Trump's own White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, tried to stop them. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=148.76000000000002s)]
*  I opened the door and I walked in. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=156.68s)]
*  I saw General Flynn. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=160.72s)]
*  I saw Sidney Powell sitting there. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=162.36s)]
*  I was not happy to see the people in the Oval Office. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=165.68s)]
*  Well, again, I don't think they were providing. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=170.28s)]
*  Well, first of all, the Overstock person, I've never met him, never met him, never met him. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=173.60000000000002s)]
*  This guy was. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=178.16s)]
*  Actually, the first thing I did, I walked in, I looked at him and I said, who are you? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=179.52s)]
*  And he told me, I don't think any of these people were providing the president with good advice. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=184.04000000000002s)]
*  And so I didn't understand how they had gotten in. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=192.24s)]
*  I'll tell you how they got in, Pat Cipollone. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=198.6s)]
*  The president of the United States invited them in. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=201.56s)]
*  He wanted Overstock.com guy right there. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=204.23999999999998s)]
*  There was a reason that Donald Trump cleaved to the most whacked out, power hungry, reality denying weirdos in his inner circle [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=208.84s)]
*  instead of listening to his more cautious White House personnel or his top lawyers, the Department of Justice or his vice president and his vice president staff. [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=215.95999999999998s)]
*  As he felt his power slipping away, Trump very consciously invests his energy in people who would indulge his insecurities, [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=224.28s)]
*  people who would encourage him to follow his worst instincts and cling to power by any means necessary, [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=231.68s)]
*  up to and including staging the first attempted coup in American history. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=237.36s)]
*  Remember, Donald Trump was so mad he left Washington without even attending his successor's inauguration. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=243.72s)]
*  Lasting images, final days in power was him inciting insurrection egged on by the kooks who he invited into his entourage. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=249.0s)]
*  That happened. That's scary enough. But, but, but, but here we are again. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=257.28s)]
*  So look who he is keeping around him now. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=262.0s)]
*  For instance, far right media personality, Laura Loomer, a self-identified proud Islamophobe who says she's pro-white nationalism. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=264.68s)]
*  She's called Kamala Harris a drug using prostitute and who has been called appalling and extremely racist by Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Green, of all people. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=274.6s)]
*  Now, yesterday we told you how Loomer, who's called for the execution of Trump's political enemies and celebrated violence against migrants, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=284.12s)]
*  got a ride from Trump on his private jet to this week's debate. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=292.12s)]
*  How she then accompanied the former president to a 9-11 memorial observance in Manhattan despite, or who knows, maybe because of the fact she's a 9-11 truther. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=296.72s)]
*  We told you how elected Republicans and campaign officials, a la Pat Cipollone, have grown concerned over Trump's increasingly close relationship with Loomer. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=308.20000000000005s)]
*  They certainly seem very close. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=318.8s)]
*  Many insiders saying she's encouraged Trump to push the conspiracy theories he's now spouting on the campaign trail. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=320.64s)]
*  One thing is certain, Trump is kind of enamored with Loomer right now. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=327.84s)]
*  It's great to have you. You've been really very special. You work hard and you are a very opinionated lady. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=333.56s)]
*  I have to thank you for that. And in my opinion, I like that. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=340.32s)]
*  Well, I appreciate that. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=343.03999999999996s)]
*  I appreciate all of your support and everybody appreciates you. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=344.03999999999996s)]
*  Yes. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=347.2s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=348.2s)]
*  Thank you so much for inviting me to sit with you today. It's a pleasure. You're the best. I love you. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=349.2s)]
*  It's kind of sweet in its own weird way. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=352.92s)]
*  Now, all this came to a head today at Trump's latest press availability, where after a few days of people asking, like, what the hell is going on here, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=358.03999999999996s)]
*  he was asked point blank by reporters about his closeness to Loomer and her nutty extremism. [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=367.48s)]
*  What would you say to your Republican colleagues or your allies who are concerned about your close relationship with Laura Loomer? [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=372.68s)]
*  Well, I don't know what they would say. Laura has been a supporter of mine, just like a lot of people are supporters. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=379.88s)]
*  And she's been a supporter of mine. She speaks very positively of the campaign. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=386.56s)]
*  I'm not sure why you asked that question, but Laura is a supporter. I don't control Laura. Laura has to say what she wants. [[00:06:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=391.6s)]
*  She's a she's a free spirit. Well, I don't know. I mean, look, I can't tell Laura what to do. Laura is a supporter. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=399.04s)]
*  I have a lot of supporters, but so I don't know what exactly you're referring to. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=405.4s)]
*  Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President, Mr. President. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=411.47999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, please. I just don't know. Laura is a supporter. I don't know. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=414.56s)]
*  But she made she is she is a strong person. She's got strong opinions. [[00:06:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=418.4s)]
*  And I don't know what she said, but that's not up to me. She's a supporter. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=422.56s)]
*  Let's see. She's a she's free spirit. Can't keep that bird in a cage. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=427.52s)]
*  She's got to be herself. She's got to express herself and say things like 9-11 was an inside job. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=431.36s)]
*  She's a strong person and maybe 100 times she's a supporter. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=435.36s)]
*  So what can I do? Doesn't matter what the person does, they're a supporter. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=438.64s)]
*  That may all be true, but it's not true that Trump is unfamiliar with Loomer's statements. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=442.44s)]
*  And you know how I know that? Well, because just yesterday he was sharing links to Loomer's website on his own social media accounts. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=446.40000000000003s)]
*  Meanwhile, today, Loomer is today, today, posting more 9-11 conspiracy theories to her own social media. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=453.6s)]
*  I'm not going to share them with you. While some Republicans are grumbling about Trump's closeness to Loomer, others are following his lead. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=460.12s)]
*  Today, the bulwark reported that the National Republican Senatorial Committee, a group that's been doing a bang up job, by the way, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=468.28000000000003s)]
*  the GOP's official campaign arm for the upper chamber, has increasingly relied on the video content Loomer produces. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=474.92s)]
*  Since July, the NRC has promoted eight of Loomer's videos featuring her reporters who shout loaded questions from the street [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=481.4s)]
*  at Democratic senators up for reelection in battleground races. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=488.52s)]
*  Make no mistake, if Donald Trump becomes president again, Laura Loomer is going to be there on day one. [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=493.59999999999997s)]
*  She might even end up in his administration. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=500.24s)]
*  Laura Loomer has turned out to be a warrior for your dad. [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=503.32s)]
*  I pulled up the screen. [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=505.32s)]
*  I hope she's press secretary. [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=508.24s)]
*  Listen, she's she's a bulldog, man. I'll say that. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=510.15999999999997s)]
*  She gets after it. I love this press secretary just to watch DC just explode. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=513.24s)]
*  That was Don Jr. back in November of last year. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=520.8s)]
*  OK, this is not I can't stress this enough. This is not like incidental, trivial stuff. [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=524.4s)]
*  It's not guilt by association thing. Oh, you like some tweet? No, no, no, no, no, no. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=528.6s)]
*  It's Trump's MO openly embracing supporters with the most extreme, vile, authoritarian, [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=533.4s)]
*  bloodthirsty impulses to match and deepen his own and then empowering them and using them to facilitate his own worst impulses. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=538.44s)]
*  We saw it already. We've been through it. [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=546.6800000000001s)]
*  It's not theoretical. On January 6th, that's what we are heading for again. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=550.5600000000001s)]
*  Very obviously. That's why it matters that a free spirited, openly racist, deeply troubled 9-11 truth or who wants to prosecute perceived [[00:09:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=557.4000000000001s)]
*  opponents for treason is getting so very, very close to Donald Trump. [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfrFMrCoFms&t=567.92s)]
