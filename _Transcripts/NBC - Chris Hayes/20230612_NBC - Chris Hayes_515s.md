# Raskin Trump federal indictment is a ‘powerful and devastating document’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 12, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY)
*  When Donald Trump appointed Bill Barr as attorney general of the United States in 2019, he wanted [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=0.0s)]
*  someone who would protect him. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=6.6000000000000005s)]
*  And Bill Barr did not disappoint. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=8.32s)]
*  Soft peddling the Mueller report to launching an investigation into the FBI, Barr did a [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=10.72s)]
*  whole lot for Trump. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=15.08s)]
*  As David Rove, for the New Yorker, like no attorney general since the Watergate era, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=16.92s)]
*  he has acted as the president's political sword and shield. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=20.92s)]
*  So it was notable that Bill Barr went on TV this weekend and said this about the president's [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=25.32s)]
*  latest indictment. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=29.4s)]
*  If even half of it is true, then he's toast. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=32.04s)]
*  I mean, it's a very detailed indictment, and it's very, very damning. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=34.72s)]
*  And this idea of presenting Trump as a victim here, a victim of a witch hunt, is ridiculous. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=41.0s)]
*  Yes, he's been a victim in the past. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=47.16s)]
*  Yes, his adversaries have obsessively pursued him with phony claims. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=49.44s)]
*  And I've been at his side defending against him when he is a victim. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=55.4s)]
*  But this is much different. [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=60.120000000000005s)]
*  He's not a victim here. [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=61.24s)]
*  If he had just turned over the documents, which I think every other person in the country [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=62.56s)]
*  would have done, they're the government's documents. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=65.84s)]
*  They're official records. [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=68.64s)]
*  They're not his personal records. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=69.72s)]
*  Battle plans for an attack on another country or defense department documents about our [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=71.8s)]
*  capabilities are in no universe Donald J. Trump's personal documents. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=77.58s)]
*  They are the government's documents. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=83.6s)]
*  I'm joined now by Congressman Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, served on the January [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=85.83999999999999s)]
*  6th Committee, was the lead impeachment manager in the second impeachment of Donald Trump. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=89.6s)]
*  Congressman, it's good to have you on. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=93.96s)]
*  I haven't gotten a chance to talk to you since all this happened, and I know that you're [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=95.75999999999999s)]
*  a constitutional law professor and know your way around the law and have thought a lot [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=99.19999999999999s)]
*  about Donald Trump's behavior, particularly in the run-up to January 6th and after. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=102.96s)]
*  And I'm curious what you make of the indictment. [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=107.19999999999999s)]
*  Well, it's a powerful and devastating document, which, if it turns out to be true, leads irresistibly [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=110.64s)]
*  to conviction and manifestation of his guilt. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=121.32000000000001s)]
*  I mean, it's a remarkable thing that he did. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=127.08000000000001s)]
*  And it's a very finely tuned instrument, this indictment, because it points out that [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=130.4s)]
*  there are hundreds and hundreds of documents that were taken. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=137.12s)]
*  But when he returned the first batch, they let him go on all of that stuff, even though [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=142.12s)]
*  it was a crime for him to be in unlawful possession of them originally. [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=147.32s)]
*  They're only going after him for his continuing refusal to turn over other documents and then [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=151.92000000000002s)]
*  his game of hide and go seek that he plays with the government and indeed with his own [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=158.84s)]
*  lawyers. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=163.56s)]
*  So I think that they have found him on very clean and simple charges that seem irrefutable, [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=165.22s)]
*  at least now. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=175.3s)]
*  But I'm curious, you know, under the presumption of innocence and due process, what he and [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=176.3s)]
*  his lawyers will have to say about it. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=180.94s)]
*  We are in fairly uncharted constitutional territory here for this reason. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=183.18s)]
*  One is that there was reporting by multiple folks sourced to people around Trump that [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=186.98s)]
*  one of the reasons he declared so early and he declared for election very early was so [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=192.48s)]
*  that he could point to any subsequent indictments as political. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=197.7s)]
*  He unilaterally could transform them into political and say, well, you're you're indicting [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=200.92s)]
*  someone running for office if he decided to run for office early. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=206.22s)]
*  But it is the case now that presidential candidate is indicted in two different jurisdictions. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=210.2s)]
*  There may be further to go. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=216.57999999999998s)]
*  And this question about like timing and what justice looks like and what it would mean [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=219.78s)]
*  for the office, the presidency. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=223.42s)]
*  Like have you tried to get your head around any of that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=225.39999999999998s)]
*  Well, yeah. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=229.45999999999998s)]
*  You know, Trump has got to accept the fact that constitutional agnosticism about your [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=230.45999999999998s)]
*  criminal status cuts in both directions. [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=238.04s)]
*  So he's very fond of saying even if he's convicted, he will run for office, even if he's in the [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=240.68s)]
*  middle of trial, he will run for office and he will be president if he wins and so on. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=245.94s)]
*  And he's absolutely right that the only requirements for running for president are age and being [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=250.72s)]
*  a born citizen as opposed to a naturalized citizen of the country. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=258.06s)]
*  But it's also true that it works in the other direction, too. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=261.56s)]
*  You know, you you can't just by declaring yourself a candidate and running for office, [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=264.8s)]
*  make yourself immune to all criminal prosecution and thereby go out and rape and murder and [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=270.04s)]
*  pillage and say, well, you can't touch me because I'm running for the Republican or [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=275.38s)]
*  Democratic or Libertarian Party nomination in America. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=279.62s)]
*  It doesn't work like that. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=283.46s)]
*  So, you know, I think he's got to accept that that reality works in both directions. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=284.78s)]
*  And just like he can't be stopped from running because he's been indicted by a grand jury [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=293.54s)]
*  of his peers from South Florida. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=301.16s)]
*  Similarly, he can't be freed from ever being criminally prosecuted again because either [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=303.6s)]
*  he's a candidate or he's in office. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=309.68s)]
*  So it seems to me that the folks that want to defend who have sort of devoted themselves to [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=312.12s)]
*  Trump's defense as the kind of primary responsibility in the House of Representatives, your [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=316.88s)]
*  colleagues on the Republican side, are going to have a lot to say about this. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=322.92s)]
*  And this was Marjorie Taylor Greene today. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=326.68s)]
*  She says, well, this is her announcing a rider to defund Jack Smith. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=329.36s)]
*  Take a listen to that. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=334.12s)]
*  Today, I'd like to announce that I'm writing an appropriations rider to defund Jack Smith's [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=336.52000000000004s)]
*  special counsel, his office and the investigation. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=342.68s)]
*  Now, this strikes me as largely in her and performative. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=347.36s)]
*  I don't think that's going to happen. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=350.04s)]
*  But there are other folks, Jim Jordan, James Comer, who who might start mucking around [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=351.40000000000003s)]
*  with the Department of Justice on this. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=358.12s)]
*  And what do you anticipate and how do you chart the strategy for Democrats in the House to [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=359.6s)]
*  deal with it? [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=363.92s)]
*  Well, that's an authoritarian playbook to attack the prosecutors or attack the judges to [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=366.48s)]
*  make your guy absolutely immune and impervious to the rule of law. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=372.96s)]
*  It they're not going to be able to get that through the House, I don't think, much less the [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=378.88s)]
*  Senate. And it's too late in any event. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=384.24s)]
*  But, you know, I think that it's worth us pausing to look at that strategy. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=386.56s)]
*  I mean, these are people who declared Trump innocent before ever having seen the unsealed [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=394.6s)]
*  indictment, much less waited to see how the trial unfolds. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=401.52s)]
*  I mean, they're declaring themselves not just defense counsel, but also judge and jury in [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=405.48s)]
*  the case. And they're declaring him innocent. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=411.16s)]
*  It's as if Donald Trump must be innocent of charges for anything that he does. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=413.20000000000005s)]
*  And he is, you know, as we know, absolutely incorrigible recidivist when it comes to [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=420.64000000000004s)]
*  offenses against the rule of law. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=427.76000000000005s)]
*  On January 6, obviously, quite famously, there were criminal recommendations that were [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=430.88s)]
*  offered by your committee. Those have no force of law. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=434.96000000000004s)]
*  They're essentially just, you know, you guys saying, look, we we investigate this. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=437.0s)]
*  We think crimes are committed and we think we're committed by the by the president. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=442.6s)]
*  I wonder if the outcome of this investigation makes you feel in either direction about [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  whether we would see some further criminal ramifications for his role in the coup. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=451.44s)]
*  Well, I think that there are a lot of people in the country breathing a sigh of relief that [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=460.84000000000003s)]
*  Donald Trump cannot completely escape the criminal justice consequences of his own [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=467.12s)]
*  actions. And, you know, as he gets away with one thing, you know, whether it's emoluments [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=474.84s)]
*  clause violations or the Ukraine shakedown, then it empowers him and inspires him to go [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=480.88s)]
*  on further and incite violent insurrection and steal government documents. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=486.76s)]
*  So we do need to have some criminal consequences. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t1Gjz_KUzDY&t=491.52s)]
