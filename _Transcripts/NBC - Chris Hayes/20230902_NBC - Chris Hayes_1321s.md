# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Sept.1
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 02, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Today, a federal judge sentenced one of the most [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=0.0s)]
*  infamous figures in the January 6th attack on the Capitol to 10 years in prison. Proud Boy [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=5.04s)]
*  Dominic Pizzola was convicted of six felonies for his actions that day, along with several other [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=11.36s)]
*  members of the far-right quasi-militia group. On January 6th, Pizzola was the first person to [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=17.36s)]
*  breach the Capitol building, smashing open a window with a riot shield he'd stolen from an officer. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=23.28s)]
*  Inside the building, Pizzola led a group of rioters through the halls where they came within sight of [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=30.0s)]
*  Senator Chuck Grassley, then third in line to the presidency as he was evacuated from the Senate [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=52.08s)]
*  chamber. Pizzola also filmed himself in the Capitol, smoking what he called a victory cigar, [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=57.12s)]
*  though that didn't really turn out. Now, Pizzola was actually the third Proud Boy to be sentenced [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=63.199999999999996s)]
*  this week. Yesterday, Judge Timothy Kelly handed down a 15-year sentence to Zachary Rell, [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=68.88s)]
*  who led 200 people to the Capitol on January 6th, and 17 years for Joseph Biggs, whose prosecutors [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=74.0s)]
*  described as the tip of the spear throughout the attack. This afternoon, he also sentenced Ethan [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=82.56s)]
*  Nordeen, former president of the Proud Boy Seattle chapter, to 18 years. Those men received longer [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=88.64s)]
*  sentences because they were convicted of the rare and quite serious charge of seditious conspiracy. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=94.32000000000001s)]
*  Dominic Pizzola was the only one of his co-defendants to be acquitted on that charge. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=100.64s)]
*  Today, in front of Judge Kelly, Pizzola expressed remorse, calling his actions, [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=105.44s)]
*  quote, the worst, most regrettable decision in his life. He was also seen wiping away tears [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=109.76s)]
*  while his wife and mother spoke to the court, pleading for mercy on his behalf. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=115.92s)]
*  But after the judge announced the 10-year sentence, as he's being led out of the courtroom, [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=120.64s)]
*  Pizzola turned to the gallery, raised a fist, and shouted, quote, Trump won. Now, so far, [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=124.96000000000001s)]
*  all of these sentences, remember the Proud Boys, have represented significant downward departure [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=132.8s)]
*  from the federal sentencing guidelines and the government's request. Prosecutors asked for 33 [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=138.24s)]
*  years for Joseph Biggs, 30 for Zachary Reel, 27 for Ethan Nordeen, and 20 for Dominic Pizzola. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=143.68s)]
*  They each received a lot less than that. And as I've said before, I'm generally in favor of lower [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=150.24s)]
*  sentences. I think this is something we get wrong in this country. Prison sentences in the US are [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=155.44s)]
*  much more severe than our peers, averaging twice as long as the next country, which is Hungary. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=160.56s)]
*  But I also got to say, as these January 6 cases pile up, it's become even clearer that we live in [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=166.48s)]
*  a country with a two-tier system of justice, and it's enraging. On January 6, 2021, thousands of [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=170.95999999999998s)]
*  people descended on the Capitol in a violent attack broadcast live on television. There were [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=178.56s)]
*  just a handful of arrests that day. Nearly all those people left freely. They went home. [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=184.0s)]
*  Now, to their credit, the DOJ then launched a massive investigation charging more than [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=190.32s)]
*  1,000 rioters. The vast majority of them have not been in jail while they await trial. And that [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=196.32000000000002s)]
*  itself is not the norm. Let's be clear. Studies show that 75% of people charged in federal court [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=202.08s)]
*  are detained pre-trial, many because they cannot afford bail. And yet, there are some that were [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=208.96s)]
*  detained pre-trial. And some of those jailed January 6 defendants and their allies, like [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=216.72000000000003s)]
*  Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump, have loudly complained about the conditions of their [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=221.36s)]
*  detention. Well, the conditions in American jails are awful. That's true. It's true for everyone who [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=226.4s)]
*  goes there. Most of the time, Marjorie Taylor Greene and Donald Trump and all the rest don't [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=233.84s)]
*  really care much about it. Take the Fulton County Jail, for example. Well, Donald Trump briefly [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=238.72000000000003s)]
*  stopped in last week, pulled up in a giant motorcade, a pre-negotiated bond agreement, [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=244.0s)]
*  spent a grand total of about 20 minutes inside. Ever since, the ex-president has been [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=248.72s)]
*  whining about how humiliating it was to have his mug shot taken. Of course, much worse things happen [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=253.44s)]
*  in that jail to people who go there for things that are, to my mind, much less serious than [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=259.76s)]
*  trying to overthrow American democracy. Twenty-three people have died while in custody at the Fulton [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=264.0s)]
*  County Jail in a little over three years. Just last week, listen to this, a 34-year-old inmate [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=270.08s)]
*  was found dead days after he sent a desperate letter to federal court about his treatment at [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=277.12s)]
*  the jail. This week, this week, one detainee was killed, two others injured in multiple stabbings. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=283.2s)]
*  There's an ongoing DOJ civil rights investigation into the jail's conditions. The place is a human [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=292.0s)]
*  rights disaster. That's the context to remember when people like Donald Trump and his co-defendants [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=297.36s)]
*  complain about being persecuted or treated unfairly. 18 of the 19 co-defendants in the [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=304.24s)]
*  Fulton County election Rico case have not set foot in a cell. I should note the one person who did, [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=310.08s)]
*  the only black man charged, Harrison Floyd. He was detained for five days after turning himself in [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=315.92s)]
*  without a lawyer and without negotiating a bond agreement ahead of time. Floyd also had a recent [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=321.44s)]
*  arrest on his record for allegedly charging at an FBI agent who served him with a grand jury [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=326.16s)]
*  subpoena earlier this year. So as we all watch the legal maneuvering of these defendants, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=330.56s)]
*  as we analyze it and dissect it and they're exercising the due process they're entitled to [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=337.36s)]
*  by the US Constitution, we just have to remember their experience, this experience for watching [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=343.04s)]
*  play out is completely and totally removed from the actual day-to-day reality of how the American [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=349.04s)]
*  criminal justice system works. The vast majority of defendants in this country are not running [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=356.16s)]
*  around filing motions and selling t-shirts with their mugshots on it. They are sitting in jail, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=362.08000000000004s)]
*  jails that are often dangerous where they may get a few visits from their public defender before [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=368.8s)]
*  they go and plead guilty. That's how the system normally works. What Donald Trump and his co-defendants [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=374.56s)]
*  including the Proud Boys have experienced can only be described as the white glove bespoke [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=382.56s)]
*  five-star top tier version of the American justice system. And they still say they're being unfairly [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=387.68s)]
*  persecuted and they are still largely undeterred. I mean that's clear as Donald Trump continues [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=394.48s)]
*  flying around in his private jet. His former lawyer John Eastman keeps making TV appearances. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=402.0s)]
*  It's clear from the behavior of Proud Boy Donnie Pezzolla in court today when he stood up called [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=407.28s)]
*  himself a change in Hubble man received a 10-year sentence again significantly less than prosecutors [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=410.72s)]
*  asked for and when the judge left the room Dominic Pezzolla turned to the gallery to yell Trump won. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=415.6s)]
*  I'm not sure if the lesson is really getting through. We continue to cover the rise in [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=423.20000000000005s)]
*  anti-democratic efforts by Republican officials in states across the country. We did so yesterday [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=428.48s)]
*  with that absolutely crazy story out of North Carolina where it appears Republicans or someone [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=433.36s)]
*  has launched a judicial commission investigation which may call for the removal of the sole black [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=438.32s)]
*  female justice on the state Supreme Court because she was caught speaking about the lack of diversity [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=444.48s)]
*  in the court system in an interview when she was asked about it. Well tonight we got another one [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=450.15999999999997s)]
*  of those stories and this one is out of Wisconsin about Republicans stopping at nothing to just get [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=455.36s)]
*  rid of state judges they don't like. In April Wisconsin held a high stakes election for an open [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=460.56s)]
*  state Supreme Court seat a seat that would determine if conservatives maintain control [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=467.68s)]
*  of that ultra important high court. We covered it on the show it got a lot of national attention. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=472.4s)]
*  Justices in Wisconsin don't actually run on partisan lines not DNR but back in April there [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=478.0s)]
*  was a clear liberal and a conservative candidate so Democrats and Republicans too right saw it as a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=483.84s)]
*  race with the fate of the court up in for grabs. Democrats saw an opportunity to flip the court [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=490.4s)]
*  for the first time in 15 years and it wasn't even close. NBC News has projected a result in [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=496.56s)]
*  the very important Wisconsin Supreme Court election tonight. Janet Protasewicz is the more [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=504.32s)]
*  liberal of the two candidates. Dan Kelly the more conservative of the two candidates. This is [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=512.4s)]
*  considered broadly to be the most important election in the country the most consequential [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=516.64s)]
*  election in the country in the year 2023. As you see with these elections here the projected [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=521.76s)]
*  winner is Janet Protasewicz. So the more liberal justice Janet Protasewicz won by a whopping 11 [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=526.64s)]
*  points the conservative got absolutely crushed and he was not very happy about it. I wish that in a [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=533.92s)]
*  circumstance like this I would be able to concede to a worthy opponent [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=542.24s)]
*  but I do not have a worthy opponent to which I can concede. My opponent is a serial liar. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=550.8s)]
*  She's disregarded judicial ethics. She's demeaned the judiciary with her behavior. [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=560.24s)]
*  Here's one of the nastiest concessions speeches I've ever seen. Hard to imagine that guy didn't [[00:09:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=567.6s)]
*  win over the voters of Wisconsin. But apart from the utter lack of decorum Republicans were sulking [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=573.36s)]
*  because here's the thing. Wisconsin its state legislature is one of the most gerrymandered [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=579.36s)]
*  states in the country. It's a 50-50 state right? We know that right down the middle. [[00:09:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=583.52s)]
*  Statewide elections have been won by Democrats, governor right now, the attorney general. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=588.16s)]
*  But the state legislature because of the maps they themselves have drawn [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=592.3199999999999s)]
*  has super majorities in both houses under Republican control because of those maps. [[00:09:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=596.64s)]
*  Their entire power in the state rests on that. Rests on those maps. Now the existential threat [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=602.0799999999999s)]
*  to that power would be if the state supreme court in Wisconsin found those jerry maps to be [[00:10:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=608.4799999999999s)]
*  unconstitutional under state law. Now that is a real possibility with the new four to three majority [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=614.64s)]
*  and new lawsuits challenging the gerrymandered maps. And so before she's even heard a single [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=622.0s)]
*  case in the state supreme court, Republican lawmakers, the ones who gerrymander those maps [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=627.5999999999999s)]
*  right, are now talking about impeaching Janet Protoziewicz and removing her from office. [[00:10:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=632.4799999999999s)]
*  And here's a thing that might very well have the votes do it. Ruth Conniff is editor of chief of [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=639.5999999999999s)]
*  Wisconsin examiner and has been reporting on this and she joins me now. Ruth, this is really [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=644.72s)]
*  something. So first just tell us what is the status? My understanding is these maps were [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=650.08s)]
*  challenged and the old four three court with the conservative majority said they're fine, is that [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=655.84s)]
*  right? Well, yes. The old majority, I mean it goes back further than that when Republicans controlled [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=661.7600000000001s)]
*  not just both houses of the legislature but also the governor's mansion under Scott Walker, [[00:11:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=669.12s)]
*  they gerrymandered the maps in 2010 after that census and they made this incredibly Republican [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=673.36s)]
*  favoring setup in a back room, you know, in a map that was challenged repeatedly in court, [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=680.32s)]
*  hidden from the public, you know, very much all Republicans rigging it for themselves. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=686.4s)]
*  And then in the next census, there was a new round of maps and our state supreme court, [[00:11:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=692.48s)]
*  then conservative majority of our state supreme court made a rule that it had to be the least [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=696.8000000000001s)]
*  change possible from the gerrymandered map. So they threw out the perspective maps made by a [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=701.6s)]
*  nonpartisan commission that could have been, you know, fair maps and they insisted on this least [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=706.88s)]
*  change standard. And so we have maps that are once again, pretty much the same, same gerrymandering. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=711.0400000000001s)]
*  And that there is going, there is a lawsuit now, right? This is going to come back to the state [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=717.12s)]
*  supreme court where there's a color of a claim and in the past other justices have found that [[00:12:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=721.36s)]
*  it violates the, the, the state constitution. Yeah. I mean, it's, it's, you know, it's been an [[00:12:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=726.64s)]
*  issue for years that we don't have fair maps. I mean, the clearest illustration of how unfair [[00:12:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=735.76s)]
*  they are was in the 2018 election when governor Evers, a Democrat was elected and Democrats won [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=740.64s)]
*  every single statewide race that year. And yet in the assembly, Democrats were only able to win 36 [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=745.36s)]
*  out of 99 seats. So you can, the skew is overwhelming. People voted by many more points than half for [[00:12:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=751.44s)]
*  Democrats. And yet they couldn't pick up, you know, more than a third of seats. So, so yeah, [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=759.9200000000001s)]
*  it's very gerrymandered. There's no question about that. And the fact that they're accusing [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=764.8000000000001s)]
*  protest, say what's of somehow being corrupt for having said what everyone knows, which is that the [[00:12:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=768.5600000000001s)]
*  maps are rigged. A federal judge has said it. It's, you know, a standard line in AP news stories. [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=773.2s)]
*  Robin Vasi, the head of our assembly, who's now threatening to impeach her has admitted it himself. [[00:12:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=778.56s)]
*  You know, it's, this is, it's a fact. It's just factually, you know, demonstrable that the maps [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=783.8399999999999s)]
*  are rigged. Yeah. Yeah. If you have an election like 2018, where you, you win a bunch of statewide [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=789.04s)]
*  races and in that same election with that state voter base who votes for a bunch of Democrats [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=795.36s)]
*  statewide turns into a two to one majority in one house. Like, you know, so this is the thing though, [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=801.4399999999999s)]
*  this is existential for them, right? Because this is how they have their power. So they are [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=807.44s)]
*  now talking about publicly impeaching her before she even does anything or rules. Right? Am I right [[00:13:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=812.0s)]
*  about that? Right? Yes, you're right. You're right about that. Robin Vasi, who is the speaker of the [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=817.84s)]
*  assembly has said that they're going to seriously consider impeaching her. And the issue that they [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=822.72s)]
*  want to impeach her on is that it was unfair for her during her campaign to say plainly that she [[00:13:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=827.2800000000001s)]
*  thought the maps were rigged, that she described that, that that was somehow prejudging a case. [[00:13:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=833.28s)]
*  Of course there was no case at that time. So even that is, is kind of silly. But the thing is it's [[00:13:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=837.28s)]
*  a constitutional crisis in Wisconsin because there are recusal rules in the state Supreme court. [[00:14:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=843.12s)]
*  And the recusal rules are weak because the then conservative majority made them that way. In 2017, [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=849.04s)]
*  they rejected an effort to say that judges should be forced to recuse if they had their own donors [[00:14:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=855.8399999999999s)]
*  in front of them. They said, no, we're not going that far. In fact, we're going to let judges [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=860.56s)]
*  decide whether or not to recuse in every case, including the Supreme court justices. So there's [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=864.0s)]
*  no basis for this. And it's, you know, it's really a lot of talking points and a lot of drama, [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=868.56s)]
*  but there's just no, there's no actual law behind it. I mean, the only, I think, I mean, they may [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=873.4399999999999s)]
*  go ahead with this. The only sort of hope again here is that like there's actual public opinion [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=879.68s)]
*  backlash that they do, which I think there will be. I mean, so we're going to, we're going to keep [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=883.68s)]
*  our eyes on this one. It's not going to like go under the radar if they actually try to pull this [[00:14:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=887.52s)]
*  off. Ruth, kind of thanks so much for joining us. Go say your last word. Go ahead. Well, it's just [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=891.52s)]
*  that they could procedurally delay her if they impeach, but don't convict. She can't act. And so [[00:14:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=896.72s)]
*  then that sets up this dilemma where she's kind of sidelined for the, before the 2024 election on [[00:15:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=902.16s)]
*  this issue. And so the issue there is Evers could reappoint. He could, you know, she could quit, [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=907.6s)]
*  somebody else could step in. And so that is going to unfold. And that's going to be very interesting. [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=912.64s)]
*  The writers and actors strike has basically frozen all TV and movie production. There've been some [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=918.0s)]
*  talks between the production companies and the two unions. As of now, there still appears to [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=923.04s)]
*  be no end in sight. And it's not just the entertainment industry, auto workers, flight [[00:15:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=929.12s)]
*  attendants, New Jersey transit engineers, all have voted to authorize their unions to strike. [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=933.68s)]
*  Part of the reason we're seeing this huge uptake in labor, militancy and strikes right now is that [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=939.76s)]
*  the economy is booming. Labor market is today. We got the latest example of that. We got the [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=944.0s)]
*  August jobs report. The U S added 187,000 new jobs, exceeding expectations once again, [[00:15:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=949.12s)]
*  bringing the labor participation rate up to its highest level since February, 2020. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=955.28s)]
*  And joining me now is acting labor secretary Julie Sue. Secretary, the jobs number today [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=962.08s)]
*  came in above expectations though, does show deceleration in the, in the job growth over trend. [[00:16:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=968.56s)]
*  Do you, are you concerned about that? Or do you think this is coming in for the kind of [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  much vaunted soft landing people are really, really hoping for? [[00:16:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=980.0799999999999s)]
*  Exactly, Chris, this is what you'd want to see. If you want to see a soft landing, this is what is [[00:16:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=983.5999999999999s)]
*  we, you know, what we know as strong and steady growth after the very hot and rapid recovery [[00:16:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=989.68s)]
*  under president Biden, 13.5 million jobs created, record levels of unemployment. [[00:16:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=996.88s)]
*  This is the transition to the kind of strong, stable economy that we want. [[00:16:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1001.76s)]
*  So there's a lot of labor activity and labor militancy going on this summer. Of course, [[00:16:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1007.04s)]
*  as I mentioned before, you've got the writers and the actors on strike. You've got the strike [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1011.6s)]
*  authorization vote for the, the auto workers. I think that deadlines in two weeks. Do you see [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1015.4399999999999s)]
*  a role for the department of labor, the white house, the president in those negotiations? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1021.28s)]
*  Well, the president has said that he is the most pro union, pro labor president that we've had. [[00:17:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1027.0400000000002s)]
*  And part of that is economic policies that have created a tight labor market, which give workers [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1032.8000000000002s)]
*  more power. Part of that is our recognition of the collective bargaining process, why it's important, [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1037.92s)]
*  how it works and respecting the parties. So we get involved if we think we can be helpful, [[00:17:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1043.92s)]
*  but we also respect the parties and their need and willingness to grapple through some hard issues [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1048.8000000000002s)]
*  and find win-win solutions themselves. Well, I want to come back to a, one of the [[00:17:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1054.48s)]
*  more high profile labor battles that's happened under the Biden administration for which the [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1059.44s)]
*  president took some, some criticism and that was the, the railroad unions and the railroad [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1063.6s)]
*  companies are a number of unions because of the way that railroad labor disputes are sort of [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1068.8s)]
*  statutorily governed. It's possible to basically unilaterally a sort of foist an agreement on the [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1073.68s)]
*  parties in order to avoid a railroad strike that was done. And at the end of that process, [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1080.08s)]
*  the big ask from the railroad labor unions was for sick paid sick days, which they didn't have. [[00:18:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1085.76s)]
*  My understanding is that subsequent to that, there actually have been additional rounds of [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1090.8s)]
*  bargaining that have led to a number of those companies and unions actually securing paid sick [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1096.8s)]
*  days. Now, is that right? That's exactly right. So that demonstrates too, that the collective [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1101.76s)]
*  bargaining process sort of, you know, it's not, it's not like a one and done situation. [[00:18:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1107.28s)]
*  And that's exactly what happened is workers wanted paid sick days. And one thing that we saw [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1111.2s)]
*  certainly through the pandemic is just how untenable it is to have, you know, workers not [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1116.32s)]
*  having any kind of paid days where they can just take off when they need to because they're sick, [[00:18:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1123.28s)]
*  because a family member is sick. And so the rail workers have gotten that. And that's just one [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1127.68s)]
*  example of many in which unions and employers have come together to the bargaining table [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1132.4s)]
*  and reached really historic wins. We see that in the West Coast ports, right? 29 ports, [[00:18:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1138.5600000000002s)]
*  I L W U made historic demands and they just ratified that contract. Obviously the teamsters [[00:19:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1143.0400000000002s)]
*  and UPS, same thing. Yep. Yeah. And that was another one that looked like it, I think there [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1149.1200000000001s)]
*  was also a strike authorization vote there. They did not have to go to a strike that they came to a [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1154.48s)]
*  deal. You've been around labor your whole life and career. You worked representing folks that were [[00:19:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1160.48s)]
*  workers, garment workers. You're now, you've been a policy person. You're now the acting secretary [[00:19:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1168.88s)]
*  of labor. What is your belief about why we are seeing the level of labor activism, militancy, [[00:19:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1173.52s)]
*  organizing that we're seeing this year in the last two years? I think it's a few things. One is that [[00:19:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1181.04s)]
*  we are coming off a global pandemic and the pandemic induced economic catastrophe that has [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1188.0s)]
*  given a lot of people some room to take stock and workers are realizing that for a long time, [[00:19:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1193.92s)]
*  workers have not gotten their fair share that there has been growing inequality, that there's been [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1200.8s)]
*  declining unionization for the last about four decades, stagnant wages and workers are realizing [[00:20:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1206.32s)]
*  that in this moment they want better and they deserve better. Another part of it is that a strong [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1212.48s)]
*  labor movement and a worker centered economy is very much part of Bidenomics. It's the president's [[00:20:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1220.16s)]
*  entire vision for how we build a strong workforce, profitable employers and a strong nation. [[00:20:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1226.08s)]
*  Final question for you is about a regulation the Department of Labor just promulgated, if I'm not [[00:20:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1233.68s)]
*  mistaken, on overtime pay. This is one of those things where, again, these things can happen [[00:20:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1237.52s)]
*  deep in the administrative state. They wind through, they get announced, but they have [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1242.4s)]
*  incredibly important tangible consequences for people. Explain to me the new rule, which [[00:20:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1246.24s)]
*  my understanding would make several million more workers eligible for overtime pay. [[00:20:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1250.4s)]
*  That's right. All of our rulemaking is extremely transparent, Chris. It goes through a process, [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1255.2s)]
*  it was publicly announced and now there's a comment period before it gets finalized. [[00:21:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1260.96s)]
*  The overtime rule is really about that American promise that if you put in a fair day's, a hard [[00:21:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1266.3200000000002s)]
*  day's work, you should get a just day's pay, right? A fair day's pay for a hard day's work. [[00:21:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1273.92s)]
*  When finalized, if at this standard, it would get about 3.6 million workers who are currently [[00:21:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1281.1200000000001s)]
*  not eligible for overtime, overtime. That's just to protect people. If you work over 40 hours in a [[00:21:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1287.3600000000001s)]
*  week, you should be paid for it. Acting Secretary of Labor Julie Hsu on this Labor Day weekend, [[00:21:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1291.84s)]
*  thank you so much for making some time for us. Thank you so much, Chris. Happy Labor Day to you. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URIp2JOXrdg&t=1297.52s)]
