# Hayes: Trump’s Putin call proves he hates our allies and loves our enemies
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 12, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes in just the past few hours [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=0.0s)]
*  We've gotten a fuller look at Donald Trump's foreign policy vision and I have to say [[00:00:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=3.48s)]
*  It is worse and more dangerous than I think I even expected [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=8.8s)]
*  With MAGA poised to rapidly undo the American-led global democratic order in fact taking concrete steps today to do so and unraveling [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=13.620000000000001s)]
*  That began this morning with an announcement from Trump's Secretary of Defense Pete Hegseth saying that America was pulling back from defending its allies [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=21.64s)]
*  We must start by recognizing that returning to Ukraine's pre-2014 borders is an unrealistic objective [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=31.0s)]
*  Chasing this illusionary goal will only prolong the war and cause more suffering. The United States does not [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=40.56s)]
*  Believe that NATO membership for Ukraine is a realistic outcome of a negotiated settlement [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=48.879999999999995s)]
*  We're also here today to directly and unambiguously [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=54.54s)]
*  Ambiguously express that stark strategic realities prevent the United States of America from being [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=57.46s)]
*  Primarily focused on the security of Europe [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=65.02s)]
*  So we want the Ukraine war to end Ukraine will have to hand over territory that Russia took from military force [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=68.7s)]
*  Ukraine won't be in NATO. I mean again, these are all the things that we're gonna be negotiated rack, right and [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=74.14s)]
*  Crucially and that was really the key line there. We're pulling back from NATO. You're kind of on your own. You're a [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=79.66s)]
*  Sort of side concern [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=85.34s)]
*  Now part of the reason this type of rhetoric is so seismic the reason it had such [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=88.34s)]
*  Explosive landing on the continent and around the world has to do with what NATO stands for when it was created [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=92.62s)]
*  I mean the reason that we have this set of interlocking international institutions from the World Bank to the IMF the UN to NATO [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=98.54s)]
*  They were established after World War two [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=106.58s)]
*  precisely [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=109.26s)]
*  Because of the tens of millions of people who died in the bloodshed as a result of the competitive conquering [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=111.3s)]
*  aspirations of rising empires and fascist regimes throughout the world [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=117.14s)]
*  NATO was formed by the United States 76 years ago to pledge that an attack on one member was an attack on all what is known [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=122.14s)]
*  As Article 5 it started with 12 countries. It now has 32 members. The only time we should know that article 5 was actually invoked the one time [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=129.02s)]
*  Was when all the Allies joined together in one fight [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=137.85999999999999s)]
*  When they all came to America's aid after September 11th [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=141.29999999999998s)]
*  Pledging their troops and material to our war in Afghanistan Canadians Italians Danes Spaniards Norwegians [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=146.22s)]
*  Estonians Latvians and more gave their lives for our war on terror [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=152.94s)]
*  That's how alliances work allies are supposed to have each other's back at least they were before this morning [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=159.5s)]
*  Not long after Hegcess spoke Senate Republicans voted to confirm [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=165.06s)]
*  Telsey Gabbard as the next director of National Intelligence a policy lightweight [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=168.9s)]
*  His greatest foreign policy achievement was visiting Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad along with his top cleric who threatened suicide bombings in the United States [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=173.78s)]
*  Gabbard also has a lengthy track record of siding with Russia and Putin over US intelligence consensus [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=182.5s)]
*  And that just sat fine with all the Senate Republicans except for Mitch McConnell [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=187.94s)]
*  Who joined all 47 Democrats and independents in voting against Gabbard [[00:03:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=191.94s)]
*  Here is Gabbard being sworn in just hours after that confirmation vote at almost the same time [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=196.5s)]
*  Gabbard was being confirmed Donald Trump was getting off the phone with another international leader [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=201.54s)]
*  Breaking news from the White House President Trump saying he's spoken with Russian President Vladimir Putin this morning [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=207.14s)]
*  Trump says he agreed to visit Russia and Putin is coming here to the US [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=213.06s)]
*  Trump breaking the news of his quote highly productive call with Putin on social media this morning saying we both agreed [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=216.9s)]
*  We want to stop the millions of deaths taking place in the war with Russia Ukraine [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=221.62s)]
*  President Putin even used my very strong campaign motto of common sense. Wow [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=225.22s)]
*  We both believe very strongly in it. Well, that's nice [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=230.5s)]
*  We agreed to work together very closely including visiting each other's capital N nations [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=233.38s)]
*  Now [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=239.86s)]
*  I think the idea of bringing the war to some conclusion is that we're both very close to each other [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=240.66s)]
*  And peace is obviously something that basically everyone wants at this point [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=246.9s)]
*  but [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=250.66s)]
*  The glaring thing here is that the other country [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=251.70000000000002s)]
*  On the receiving end of russia's aggression the one that got invaded that's had thousands of people killed by Russian troops who invaded ukraine [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=254.98000000000002s)]
*  Didn't seem to be looped in on the developments relating to their future [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=263.06s)]
*  No, I don't think so as long as he's there but you know at some point you're gonna have to have elections too [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=272.02s)]
*  You're gonna have to have an election [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=276.97999999999996s)]
*  Um, it's an interesting question [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=283.14s)]
*  Uh, I think they have to make peace [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=286.41999999999996s)]
*  Their people are being killed and I think they have to make peace president. Putin wants to have peace now and [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=288.97999999999996s)]
*  That's good, and he didn't want to have peace with biden [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=294.58s)]
*  I want to be clear about what we're watching just today [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=299.06s)]
*  You are watching donald trump disassembling the us-led international worker [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=302.9s)]
*  I mean it started with the usaid stuff [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=306.58s)]
*  But but today was the first big step to take it apart in order to benefit global [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=308.42s)]
*  Authoritarians that he envies and and and openly admires [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=313.76s)]
*  Politically trump has succeeded in selling this kind of foreign policy posture a sort of america first isolationism to a lot of americans [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=317.94s)]
*  And it's really true that our leading role in the world has been largely a product of a kind of [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=326.04s)]
*  bipartisan elite consensus and sometimes pretty removed from democratic majorities [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=330.90000000000003s)]
*  Who tend to believe americans give out too much foreign aid and quote police the world? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=335.40000000000003s)]
*  And believe me I gotta say [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=340.28000000000003s)]
*  Personally, i've spent two decades critiquing the many many shortcomings and downright cruelties and absurdities of that same american-led international order [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=342.28000000000003s)]
*  Is it true that the international order is a perfect and perfect world order? [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=351.72s)]
*  But however imperfect it is and god is it [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=356.84000000000003s)]
*  What trump wants to replace it with is just far far worse [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=360.76s)]
*  Again the current international order was created by the u.s. And its allies to prevent the world from the unthinkable [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=366.2s)]
*  There were rising tensions between the victorious nuclear superpowers and institutions like nato [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=373.24s)]
*  From becoming world war three in a global nuclear holocaust and by the way the threat of nuclear war is not exactly gone [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=377.48s)]
*  But there's another reason trump is eager to jettison the old order in favor of an anarchic world in which strong countries just do what they want [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=385.16s)]
*  Back in the day when you would hear nazis claim that austrians austrians and cheques really are german anyway [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=394.12s)]
*  You can hear echoes of putin's claim that ukrainians are really just misguided russians. There's no such thing as ukraine [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=399.72s)]
*  And so right now what trump is doing is sending the message to everyone around the world [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=405.23999999999995s)]
*  That not only is territorial acquisition by force. Okay, but and this is really crucial the u.s. Is interested in pursuing it [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=408.91999999999996s)]
*  repeatedly constantly over the last few weeks from greenland to panama canal to canada as a 51st state to now envisioning the gaza strip [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=417.85999999999996s)]
*  As an american occupied development project [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=426.11999999999995s)]
*  The emerging trump doctrine is that democracies are weak and soft we will sigh with autocracy over over them [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=429.4s)]
*  And it's disastrous not just for america's place in the world [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=435.71999999999997s)]
*  But also for the cause of peace [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=439.64s)]
*  The idea that the path to peace is to throw overboard democracies in favor of authoritarian regimes is wildly dangerous [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=442.12s)]
*  It's the fundamental through line of trump's world view [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=448.36s)]
*  He he hates our allies. He's trying to pick a fight with canada and [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=451.96s)]
*  Seems to love our enemies because our enemies see the world as he does transactional right for the picking [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=456.68s)]
*  And with loyal morally flexible subordinates like hegseth and gabard he is essentially reorienting american politics as friendly to dictators and authoritarian regimes [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=463.48s)]
*  Primarily and hostile fundamentally to democracies [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=472.68s)]
*  It's shaping up to me the most radical transformation of america's role in the world since roosevelt [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=476.52s)]
*  And I don't think it's going to end very well [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=481.4s)]
*  You [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lgbxby28BGA&t=486.68s)]
