# Bernie: Elon wants you to think ‘government stinks’—so he can privatize it
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 19, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA)
*  Senator Bernie Sanders is an independent of Vermont. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=0.0s)]
*  This week he's launching a national tour to fight oligarchy here in America. [[00:00:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=2.7600000000000002s)]
*  He's visiting swing districts represented by Republican members of Congress. [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=7.28s)]
*  Senator, great to see you. Thank you for being with us. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=11.56s)]
*  We've been talking about consumers and protections for Americans this whole show. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=14.0s)]
*  You have been talking about the oligarchy and warning about [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=18.32s)]
*  the concentration of wealth and power long before it became stylish to do so. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=21.44s)]
*  Given everything you've been talking about for decades, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=26.080000000000002s)]
*  what advice do you have to the rest of us who have woken up to this threat? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=28.7s)]
*  I think the main political point is that we should not forget that in the House of Representatives today, [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=33.9s)]
*  the Republicans have a three vote majority. That's all. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=41.3s)]
*  And if we could turn two Republicans around to vote no, for example, against massive tax breaks for billionaires [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=45.019999999999996s)]
*  while they cut Medicaid and education and vitally important programs for working people, [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=53.5s)]
*  we can make a huge dent in the Trump agenda. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=58.379999999999995s)]
*  So right now, what I am focusing on, Ali, is getting out to districts around the country [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=62.3s)]
*  where Republicans, won by slim margins, inform the people there what's at stake [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=67.82s)]
*  and urge them to have their members do the right thing and vote no on the so-called reconciliation bill. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=73.5s)]
*  All right. So to anybody who's out there, who's watching, who might be a Democrat, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=79.97999999999999s)]
*  who might have voted for Donald Trump, might be Republican, might be a moderate. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=83.42s)]
*  What's the message? Because in broad strokes, when Doge was first floated and it was Vivek Ramaswamy [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=86.22s)]
*  and it was Elon Musk and they were going to find waste fraud and whatever it is in government, [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=91.82s)]
*  in broad strokes, that appeals to people because we'd all like to have lower taxes and not have any waste. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=96.38s)]
*  What do you say to people like that to say this isn't actually what you were promised? [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=101.58s)]
*  All right. This is what we say. Is there waste and bureaucracy and fraud within the federal government? [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=106.86s)]
*  Absolutely, there is. Should we do our best to get rid of it? Absolutely. But number one, keep in mind [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=113.66s)]
*  what these guys really want to do when they go after Social Security, when they go after various [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=120.61999999999999s)]
*  federal programs, at the end of the day, Ali, not tomorrow, but at the end of the day, what they want [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=126.22s)]
*  to make the case to the American people, the whole government stinks, Social Security, Medicare, [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=132.06s)]
*  Medicaid, all of these programs that help you, they're terrible and the way forward is to [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=137.66s)]
*  privatize them. You don't need a Veterans Administration. We'll let the private sector [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=144.3s)]
*  and the hospitals take care of our veterans. That is their end game. But right now, what I think we [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=149.66s)]
*  have got to make clear is that when you are throwing a thousand workers out of the Veterans [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=155.82s)]
*  Administration, scientists out of the NIH, you are harming the well-being of the American people [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=161.18s)]
*  and as you've indicated, you have the richest guy in the world elected by nobody who is doing that. [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=168.46s)]
*  So that I think is what we've got to be focusing on. Do you think, because you're targeting, you're [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=174.70000000000002s)]
*  saying we only have to turn three districts, there are the places that are up for special election [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=179.5s)]
*  right now are pretty safe Republican districts. You are talking about telling people not to change [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=184.22s)]
*  necessarily their political ideology, but to understand the importance of structure in your [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=188.78s)]
*  government that is there to work for you. Ali, there are very few people in this country who [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=194.46s)]
*  think that at a time of massive income and wealth inequality, you know, when three people are more [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=201.74s)]
*  wealth in the bottom half of American society, that billionaires need a huge tax break. Nobody [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=207.82s)]
*  believes that. And at the same time, in order to pay for that tax break, what Trump and the [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=214.3s)]
*  Republican leadership are talking about are horrific cuts to Medicaid, education, housing, [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=219.42000000000002s)]
*  and programs that working class people in this country desperately need. The overwhelming majority [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=226.62s)]
*  of the American people do not support that agenda. And our job is to educate, to organize, to put a [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=233.5s)]
*  special emphasis on those swing districts and force Republicans to do the right thing and vote [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=240.22s)]
*  no on that proposal. You just mentioned Medicaid. Donald Trump said last night he doesn't support [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=246.78s)]
*  any cuts to Medicaid. And then today he tweets out that he supports the House Republican budget, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=251.02s)]
*  which actually includes cuts to Medicaid. At what point, what are the things when you're- [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=255.26s)]
*  Massive cuts. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=259.98s)]
*  Massive cuts. And so what point do people register, hey, this isn't an abstraction about big [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=260.94s)]
*  government. This is actually about my life? [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=265.1s)]
*  Well, that is precisely what we have got to do. And when you talk about Medicaid, people may say, [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=269.18s)]
*  middle class people may say, hey, well, you know, that's too bad. Doesn't impact me. That's just [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=273.74s)]
*  poor people. Truth is that Medicaid not only provides health care to millions and millions of [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=278.62s)]
*  children, 40% of the community of the revenue for community health centers, which provide health [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=285.34000000000003s)]
*  care to 30 million people, including many people watching this program. Guess what? You cut Medicaid, [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=292.3s)]
*  you're going to make it very difficult for community health centers to do their job. You [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=297.98s)]
*  got a mother or dad who is in a nursing home. Guess what? Two out of three people in nursing homes [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=302.38s)]
*  get supported by Medicaid. At a time when our health care system today is in deep distress, [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=308.94s)]
*  it is a broken system. Massive cuts to Medicaid will cripple it. It'll raise hospital bills. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=316.94s)]
*  It'll be a disaster for virtually all Americans. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=323.18s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NkMl7AzSMeA&t=346.94s)]
