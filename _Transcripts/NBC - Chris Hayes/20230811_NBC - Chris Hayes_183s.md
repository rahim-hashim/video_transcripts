# Iowa man to Pence: ‘I’m glad they didn’t hang you’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s)
*  You know, one of the great things about the democratic enterprise of campaigning for office is that, you know, we choose our representatives and the folks that want our vote have to ask us for it. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=0.0s)]
*  And it means that candidates have to go out in the world, interact with people where they can't control what happens on the trail. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=8.64s)]
*  Particularly true for former Vice President Mike Pence. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=15.24s)]
*  I mean, he's got a weird task before him, a very strange relationship to the voters he's trying to win because they believe he sold out their beloved Donald Trump. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=17.64s)]
*  That has resulted in situations where Pence has faced questions from people who may not have been at the Capitol on January 6 chanting hang Mike Pence, but do hold a special kind of contempt for him. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=27.12s)]
*  Like this voter who confronted him in Sioux City, Iowa last month. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=38.52s)]
*  If it wasn't for your vote, we would not have Joe Biden in the White House. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=43.6s)]
*  Joe Biden shouldn't be there. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=51.08s)]
*  And all those wonderful things that you and Trump were doing together would be continuing. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=53.16s)]
*  And this country would be on the right path. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=59.2s)]
*  Do you ever second guess yourself? [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=63.28s)]
*  That was a constitutional right that you had to send those votes back to the states. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=65.64s)]
*  I'm sorry, ma'am, but that's actually what the Constitution says. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=70.36s)]
*  No vice president in American history ever asserted the. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=73.44s)]
*  I'll do respect. I said before, I said when I announced President Trump is wrong about my authority that day, and he's still. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=81.48s)]
*  Leave it with all my heart. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=89.88000000000001s)]
*  Not huge applause there, but you know, he responded and this sort of thing happens all the time. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=92.72s)]
*  Happened again yesterday at the Iowa State Fair. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=96.84s)]
*  My question is this. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=101.04s)]
*  Why did you commit treason on January 6 and not stand by the president? [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=102.28s)]
*  I don't know. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=110.0s)]
*  Buddy, shut your mouth. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=111.24s)]
*  That's a fair question. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=113.92s)]
*  Look, come on. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=114.88s)]
*  So you guys why I came. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=115.64s)]
*  No, I got you. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=119.16s)]
*  I'll answer your question. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=119.96000000000001s)]
*  I'll answer your question. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=121.16s)]
*  Now, he did get some, you know, got booze from the crowd and that guy defended him. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=123.16s)]
*  And the candidate thinks, why did you commit treason is a fair question? [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=126.12s)]
*  Well, no wonder the polling looks like it does for Mike Pence. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=131.2s)]
*  He currently ranks sixth in Iowa, just three percent. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=134.28s)]
*  Now, at least one Iowa State Affair attendee did have something nice to say to Pence this week. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=137.16s)]
*  I'm glad they didn't hang you with just over five months left until the Iowa caucus. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=154.88s)]
*  It's not much, but it's a start. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2zEZVV3sD8s&t=159.6s)]
