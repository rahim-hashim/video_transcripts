# All In with Chris Hayes - Jan. 25  Audio Only
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [January 25, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw)
*  Tonight on All Ed. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=0.0s)]
*  Melina Hava said the defense calls President Donald Trump and everybody's jaw just dropped. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=4.72s)]
*  The Republican front-runner takes a stand as we await an immunity decision and a MAGA [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=10.4s)]
*  crony is sentenced to jail. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  The top line here is that... [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=17.76s)]
*  Tonight are the slow wheels of justice endangering democracy. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=22.48s)]
*  Is Donald Trump derailing the border deal to get himself elected? [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=27.279999999999998s)]
*  That he doesn't want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=32.08s)]
*  Biden for it is really appalling. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=36.48s)]
*  And a check-in on the state of the Democratic party amid fresh new evidence of the Biden boom. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=39.6s)]
*  The U.S. economy grew at a shocking pace. I love that shocking pace. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=45.04s)]
*  But All In starts right now. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=50.08s)]
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=58.879999999999995s)]
*  So Donald Trump's closing arguments to voters in New Hampshire this past weekend into Election [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=60.56s)]
*  Day on Tuesday. The issue he's most focused on now as the man on the glide path to be the [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=65.12s)]
*  Republican nominee and run for president is that he can't be prosecuted for crimes he [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=70.88s)]
*  committed when he was president. That's his North Star. It's now his central platform plan. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=75.76s)]
*  And 16 days ago, Donald Trump's lawyers argued that ex-presidents, all ex-presidents, but [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=82.4s)]
*  particularly Donald Trump, are immune from prosecution and that therefore Trump has total [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=87.52000000000001s)]
*  immunity and cannot be brought to justice for his blatant efforts to steal the 2020 election. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=91.92s)]
*  And now, that was two weeks ago, over two weeks later, we're still waiting for the [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=98.48s)]
*  judge's decision as Trump racks up delegates at the primary and the election looms closer every day. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=103.04s)]
*  Meanwhile, many people are understandably anxious to find out if Donald Trump actually can be held [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=109.36000000000001s)]
*  legally accountable for an effort to overthrow America's constitutional republic, culminating [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=114.64s)]
*  in January 6th. The problem for everyone who wants to see Trump actually face a trial on justice, [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=121.28s)]
*  and everyone who would like this all to just be over, is that the justice system is slow. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=126.96000000000001s)]
*  Justice system doesn't work on anyone else's timeline, not a campaign timeline, and certainly [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=132.24s)]
*  not a cable news timeline. We just saw an example of this today with former Trump advisor Peter [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=136.4s)]
*  Navarro. Remember that guy? He got sentenced today to four months in prison. Navarro, along with Steve [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=142.08s)]
*  Bannon, orchestrated one of Trump's coup plots, intended to block the certification of electoral [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=148.0s)]
*  votes. And he didn't try to hide it. In fact, he even described the very plot in great detail to [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=154.24s)]
*  Ari Melbourne. This plan we had called the Green Bay sweep, clearly between constitutional and [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=159.84s)]
*  legal lines, to basically have only legal votes counted in the election. And the plan was simply [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=167.2s)]
*  this. We had over 100 congressmen and senators on Capitol ready to implement the sweep. The sweep [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=174.39999999999998s)]
*  was simply that. We were going to challenge the results of the election in the six battleground [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=182.07999999999998s)]
*  states. Yeah, you were going to try a coup. Now, unsurprisingly, Peter Navarro attracted the [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=188.64s)]
*  attention of the January 6th committee, which issued him a subpoena that Navarro ignored. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=195.35999999999999s)]
*  And in September, he was convicted on two counts of contempt of Congress for ignoring those [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=201.04s)]
*  subpoenas. They weren't long trials. He had no defense. He clearly had ignored them. And I have [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=205.67999999999998s)]
*  to say, I don't feel any particular joy at all about a 74-year-old man going to prison for four [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=210.16s)]
*  months. But Peter Navarro sentencing is welcome news in the sense it is absolutely necessary for [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=214.56s)]
*  there to be some measure of legal accountability for the people who committed gross crimes against [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=219.92000000000002s)]
*  our democracy. Once again, the problem is the timing. Navarro's sentence will not deter anyone [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=224.32s)]
*  else from defying a subpoena from the January 6th committee because the committee no longer exists. [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=231.76s)]
*  It was disbanded over a year ago. I mean, he may not even serve his time for quite a while, if at [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=237.52s)]
*  all. He will almost certainly appeal his conviction, putting the sentence on hold. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=242.96s)]
*  His co-conspirator, Steve Bannon, is still walking free, released on his own recognizance, [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=247.6s)]
*  pending his appeal out there with three shirts and a podcast a year after his sentencing on the [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=251.84s)]
*  very same charges. We've got two sayings about the justice system. They're cliches, but people use [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=257.44s)]
*  them for a reason. And I think they get at the heart of this whole conflict. One is justice [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=264.08s)]
*  delayed is justice denied. If the legal system moves too slowly, then it can't deliver justice [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=268.64s)]
*  at all. And the other indirect tension with that idea is the wheels of justice turn slowly, but [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=274.56s)]
*  grind exceedingly fine. So yes, the legal system moves slowly, but it gets the right result. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=279.68s)]
*  And it has to grind slowly to grind fine. Now, of course, we live in the era of Donald Trump, [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=285.36s)]
*  whose strategy at every turn is to test the law, to try to get away with as much as possible. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=290.8s)]
*  And one of the ways he does that is to delay, delay, delay long enough for issues to become [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=295.52s)]
*  moot or for him to return to the White House or for litigants to just give up. And we've seen that [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=300.88s)]
*  over and over that the justice system often moves slowly enough that he can't outrun it. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=305.59999999999997s)]
*  And delaying justice, getting those wheels to turn as slowly as possible for him has really worked. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=311.28s)]
*  From the very beginning, here's an example of Donald Trump's term as president. It was clear [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=318.0s)]
*  he had conflicts of interest through his businesses that really looked like they violated [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=322.72s)]
*  the Foreign Emoluments Clause of the United States Constitution. Multiple groups filed suit, [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=328.08000000000004s)]
*  and those cases turned so slowly through the system, they were eventually dismissed by the [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=333.28000000000003s)]
*  Supreme Court days after Trump left office because they were moot. And there was Manhattan [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=338.56s)]
*  District Attorney Cy Vance's effort to obtain Trump's tax returns. After an 18-month legal battle, [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=344.32000000000005s)]
*  Trump finally turned over those documents again after he was out of the White House. [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=350.16s)]
*  You may also remember Trump White House counsel Don McGahn, who, like Peter Navarro and Steve [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=355.20000000000005s)]
*  Manham, refused to comply with a congressional subpoena about Trump's attempts to interfere in [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=360.0s)]
*  the Mueller investigation to obstruct justice. It took two years before McGahn was finally forced [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=364.88000000000005s)]
*  to testify long after Trump was out of the White House and back in Mar-a-Lago and the whole chapter [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=371.44000000000005s)]
*  had closed. Oh good, okay, well yeah, we won. We get dumbed against testimony. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=376.96s)]
*  And that, of course, brings us to the most high-stake case of all, the four criminal [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=383.28s)]
*  cases against Donald Trump, totaling 91 felony counts. The speed at which these cases move is [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=387.44s)]
*  obviously absolutely critical. This is a zero-sum game. This is a finite thing. There are 284 days [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=392.64s)]
*  left until the election. Every single day, Trump and his lawyers are able to delay the proceedings [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=401.12s)]
*  to push back a trial is a victory for the ex-president. Now to her credit, Judge Tanya [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=406.16s)]
*  Chukkin overseeing the federal case about Trump's attempted coup has been moving quite efficiently. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=411.6s)]
*  She set a trial date for March 4th, but the case is on hold while we await the appeals court decision [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=416.32000000000005s)]
*  on Trump's immunity argument. It's also clear the slow pace of Trump's cases are already helping him [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=422.64000000000004s)]
*  politically. As the Wall Street Journal explains, the former president is proving less vulnerable [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=429.04s)]
*  on the legal front than many of his critics predicted. Trump has raised money on his legal [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=433.68s)]
*  battles, seeing his support grow as he depicts himself as a victim of partisan prosecutors [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=437.76s)]
*  marshaling a crooked justice system to thwart his bid for a second term in the White House. [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=442.48s)]
*  Now, I want to be very crystal clear here. It is wholly improper and illegitimate for the justice [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=447.84000000000003s)]
*  system to hurry up for the purpose of hurting Donald Trump politically. That's not what we want [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=453.12s)]
*  and not what I'm saying. But what is a legitimate argument and an important one, and it's one that [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=458.96s)]
*  both Judge Chukkin and Special Counsel Jack Smith have made, is that there is a public interest to [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=465.68s)]
*  bring Donald Trump to trial swiftly. Trying the ex-president would definitively establish whether [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=470.88s)]
*  or not he did what he is accused of, and that information, that is information that voters [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=477.28s)]
*  deserve to have. To be clear, an acquittal as much as a conviction, don't you think? [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=482.79999999999995s)]
*  Right? Don't you think if he's acquitted, not guilty, voters should know that too? [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=487.92s)]
*  That's information everyone should have before they decide if they want to send him back to the [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=492.71999999999997s)]
*  White House. Now, based on what we've seen from Republican primary voters so far, I don't know [[00:08:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=497.03999999999996s)]
*  if it would make much difference in the outcome to them. But the question is, will that key [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=503.68s)]
*  information, is the man guilty or not of attempting to subvert the Constitution, [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=508.8s)]
*  that key information and the ability to make an informed choice with it, will that be taken away [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=513.76s)]
*  from the 150 million Americans who are going to vote in November? [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=519.92s)]
*  Harry Littman is a former Deputy Assistant Attorney General for the Department of Justice. [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=526.0s)]
*  Sham Wu, served as counsel to Attorney General Janet Reno, is now a White Collar Criminal Defense [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=528.96s)]
*  Attorney. They both join me now. Sham, let me start with you just on the basic context here. [[00:08:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=533.6s)]
*  The speed at which federal courts and court systems in general are used to operating, [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=540.64s)]
*  the timeline and tempo they have tends to not be bound by deadlines. They're sort of improvised, [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=546.88s)]
*  then get delayed. You got a date and then the people, one of the lawyers says, [[00:09:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=556.4799999999999s)]
*  actually, I can't make that date. You kick it another 90 days. That's not an unfair [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=560.64s)]
*  characterization of the general tempo of American justice and even appellate practice. [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=565.76s)]
*  You're absolutely right. That's not an unfair characterization at all. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=574.24s)]
*  I think if we look at the D.C. Circuit's pending decision in particular, I don't find it to be an [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=578.24s)]
*  unusually long time that they're taking. Two weeks for a complex appellate issue is nothing. That's [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=585.12s)]
*  a dragging of the feet. Naturally, everyone is very anxious for that decision on both sides, [[00:09:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=591.76s)]
*  defense as well as prosecution, although the defense would like it to be dragged on as long [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=599.12s)]
*  as possible. They're only anxious in the sense of the outcome. The delay here is, I have to say, [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=603.68s)]
*  if there's blame to be held on anyone for this delay, it's at the feet of Attorney General [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=613.2s)]
*  Garland and the Justice Department because they started late. This was not a case that was going [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=619.44s)]
*  to quickly resolve in any sense. If they started earlier, we wouldn't be quite up against the wall [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=625.9200000000001s)]
*  the way we are. I want to say I'm not necessarily blaming anyone in particular here. I don't know [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=631.5200000000001s)]
*  what people are doing. I'm making a point here about the tension between the tempo of the courts [[00:10:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=637.5200000000001s)]
*  and the urgency of this situation. Here's an example of this, Harry. A small little [[00:10:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=643.36s)]
*  calendaring thing that indicated something important the other day, which is that Judge [[00:10:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=652.32s)]
*  Tanya Chutkin scheduled a likely trial in April. What that means is she understands that despite [[00:10:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=656.8000000000001s)]
*  the fact that ostensibly it's still slated for March 4th for Donald Trump's trial on his federal [[00:11:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=664.32s)]
*  charges for overturning the election, that's not going to happen then. She's got a trial in April. [[00:11:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=670.08s)]
*  Again, all this stuff is like in the micro, it's like what's another week here, what's another week [[00:11:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=675.44s)]
*  there. My point is there's 284 days and you add up enough numbers and you get to 284. That is how [[00:11:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=680.1600000000001s)]
*  the math works. For sure. You're right that in general, the court system works, say, by the [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=686.4000000000001s)]
*  hour hand and the political system by the second hand. I do not think that's what's going on here, [[00:11:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=695.52s)]
*  Chris. I think the D.C. Circuit set a very quick oral argument schedule and they were prepared and [[00:11:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=701.28s)]
*  people anticipated they would issue a decision in warp speed for them, very much on the second hand [[00:11:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=708.4s)]
*  kind of pace. That's been held up. We're not sure exactly why, but I think we had every expectation [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=715.92s)]
*  and might have been say by last Friday. That matters here because it's not simply an issue of [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=722.16s)]
*  slippage day by day. Because if it's the case and it looks like it well may be that the three judges [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=729.36s)]
*  don't have the same point of view, that in particular Judge Henderson, a Republican appointee, [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=737.04s)]
*  writes separately, what that might produce is an opinion that requires Judge Chutkin to apply a [[00:12:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=743.04s)]
*  different standard than the one she made. Judge Henderson, for example, was asking what about the [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=750.48s)]
*  possibility of a floodgate situation should we maybe think about limiting it somewhat? [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=757.12s)]
*  If the panel overall says something like that, that means it returns to Judge Chutkin to apply, [[00:12:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=763.52s)]
*  even if it's very straightforward, and that in turn raises the possibility of yet another [[00:12:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=770.0s)]
*  interlocutory appeal. That's the real risk here rather than the day by day loss. I think they're [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=776.96s)]
*  moving lickety split, but if they're not in lockstep with Chutkin, it nevertheless portends [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=782.8s)]
*  an additional delay. So the other issue here is just the tension between the political calendar [[00:13:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=789.76s)]
*  and the judicial calendar, which again, shouldn't be a consideration. This I think is actually the [[00:13:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=794.88s)]
*  nub of the issue. At some level it shouldn't be a consideration. You do what you do in the best way [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=800.64s)]
*  you can, right? But it's also the case that two states of voters have gone to the polls [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=806.16s)]
*  and the question of whether this man is immune from prosecution is not answered for those voters. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=811.92s)]
*  That's actually a pretty important piece of information for people to make informed choices [[00:13:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=818.88s)]
*  in the primary and in the general. I think that the way that the training works and the ethos and [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=823.36s)]
*  norms of the judicial system is that that's not our problem. That's kind of cabined. But what I'm [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=829.4399999999999s)]
*  saying is from the democratic small d perspective and a civil society perspective, it very much is [[00:13:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=834.56s)]
*  your problem. It is because for the judicial system, the judges are also citizens of the country. We [[00:13:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=838.88s)]
*  all have to live here. But I do think, to go back to my original point, once it's in the court system, [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=846.64s)]
*  I completely agree with Harry. They're moving very quickly on this, Chutkin as well as the [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=854.7199999999999s)]
*  DC circuit. I just don't think that there's any real delay that you can say because they're [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=858.64s)]
*  actually moving quickly. But when it hits the court system, there's a process that is somewhat [[00:14:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=862.88s)]
*  deliberate and takes time. It's certainly not going to be answering to political calendars. [[00:14:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=868.96s)]
*  But to get it there, there are other movers that have to get it there quickly. Law enforcement, [[00:14:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=873.28s)]
*  prosecutors. And that's why I tend to come back to say if they'd gotten an earlier start with DOJ [[00:14:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=879.04s)]
*  appointing a special counsel earlier, some of this could have been avoided. And to briefly [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=884.16s)]
*  argue against myself, which as a liberal I love to do, is the deliberateness is also on purpose [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=888.64s)]
*  because due process is process. And we don't want a star chamber justice here. We don't want a sham [[00:14:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=894.64s)]
*  trial. You know what I mean? I mean that seriously when I say, Harry, the public's owed something [[00:15:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=900.56s)]
*  definitive here in either direction. If he is not guilty of these crimes, it is important we know [[00:15:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=907.04s)]
*  that as well. I really do mean that. That it goes in either direction. And the process here [[00:15:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=912.88s)]
*  is important. You don't want to intrude on it. But the other thing about this, Harry, is this [[00:15:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=918.8s)]
*  won't go away, this problem here. It's going to haunt everything for the next 284 days. [[00:15:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=923.6s)]
*  And possibly years after that. So that's exactly right. I just want to say your small d democratic [[00:15:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=933.04s)]
*  principle has been largely adopted by the courts, which they do in very rare instances. [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=939.2s)]
*  They did in the Nixon case. And they've done in some of the Trump cases here. The Supreme Court [[00:15:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=944.32s)]
*  had a warp speed schedule for the Colorado case. I think they understand that imperative. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=951.0400000000001s)]
*  And remember, no matter what happened, it was never going to be definitively resolved. There [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=959.84s)]
*  will always be appeals and the like. But I think the courts are behind this position. And the [[00:16:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=964.64s)]
*  specific bump in the road here has to do with the lack of the unanimity of the D.C. Circuit. But you [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=970.56s)]
*  are seeing them jump to, especially in D.C., this unusual situation where the people need to know [[00:16:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=976.3199999999999s)]
*  something critical. I wholly agree. Harry Libbon, Shan Wu, thank you both. [[00:16:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=984.3199999999999s)]
*  Coming up, why the Republican frontrunner's long history of mistreating women could come [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=990.0s)]
*  back to hurt him both in the polls and the bank account. That's next. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=994.32s)]
*  Did you ever have a flicker when you're taking a shower, walking to work or waking up in the [[00:16:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1002.08s)]
*  morning when you said, Donald Trump, you've won every battle you've ever fought. Why don't [[00:16:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1005.5200000000001s)]
*  you run for governor? Why don't you run for president? Do you ever think about that? [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1008.96s)]
*  People want me to all the time. What about you? [[00:16:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1011.5200000000001s)]
*  I don't like it. Can you imagine how controversial that'd be? You think about him with the women. [[00:16:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1013.84s)]
*  How about me with the women? That was from 1998. Trump was nothing if not [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1018.1600000000001s)]
*  grossly prescient. Today, after being warned to keep his voice down in court, Trump took the [[00:17:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1024.16s)]
*  witness stand briefly, very briefly, in his sexual abuse defamation damages trial. The ex-president [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1029.2s)]
*  has already been found liable for sexually abusing and defaming writer E. Jean Carroll. She said that [[00:17:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1036.64s)]
*  he raped her in a dressing room. He called her a liar. A jury found that he was lying, in fact, [[00:17:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1041.92s)]
*  and was defaming her. He said on the stand that he considered the finding to be a, quote, [[00:17:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1047.2s)]
*  false allegation. But again, it's not a false allegation. In fact, calling it a false allegation [[00:17:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1052.0s)]
*  is the defamation he's been found liable of in the first place. And so that testimony was promptly [[00:17:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1057.76s)]
*  stricken, and Trump was soon sent back to the defense table. Trump says he will be back in [[00:17:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1063.76s)]
*  court tomorrow for closing arguments. In addition to showing up at his sexual abuse defamation trial, [[00:17:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1068.32s)]
*  Trump has also been reminding voters just who he is, with increasingly nasty attacks on his [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1075.04s)]
*  only remaining rival in the Republican primary, former South Carolina governor Nikki Haley. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1080.16s)]
*  I mean, a lot of these Wall Street guys, they know me, they like me, and I see that they're [[00:18:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1086.48s)]
*  endorsing like Nikki Haley, bird brain. A woman that I know very well, a woman that is not capable [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1090.16s)]
*  of doing this job, I know her very well. She's not tough enough. She's not smart enough. And she [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1098.0s)]
*  wasn't respected enough. She cannot do this job. Trump handily won the first two contests of [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1104.64s)]
*  the Republican nomination. But as you can see in the exit polling in New Hampshire, that victory was [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1110.48s)]
*  due in large part to a specific sector of the electorate, the big wins. Men broke for Trump, [[00:18:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1115.2800000000002s)]
*  49% to 39% for Haley, a 20 point difference. And single men? Well, they overwhelmingly preferred [[00:18:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1121.0400000000002s)]
*  Trump. 68% to 30%, plus 38 among single men. That's interesting. But women? Well, only 51% [[00:18:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1128.56s)]
*  preferred Trump. 47% wanted Haley. Katie Fang served as a prosecutor in the state attorney's [[00:18:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1136.56s)]
*  office in Florida's Miami D County. She's the host of The Katie Fang Show, which airs Saturdays at [[00:19:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1142.48s)]
*  noon here on MSNBC. She's been following E. Jean Carroll trial closely, and she joins me now. [[00:19:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1147.12s)]
*  I continue to be astounded that the person who is likely to be the nominee continues to draw [[00:19:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1152.48s)]
*  attention to an accusation that he raped a woman and then defamed her, an accusation that was [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1159.12s)]
*  essentially substantiated in a civil trial, and he was back at doing exactly that today. [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1167.2s)]
*  Yeah, because it's on brand one and two, because he's able to raise money off of it. And three, [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1174.6399999999999s)]
*  because he's a virus. And the Trump virus infects his followers, and it gives them [[00:19:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1180.88s)]
*  kind of the cover to be able to emulate him and to say and do things that are [[00:19:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1188.32s)]
*  mimicking of Donald Trump. And so because of that, that is the reason why Trump feels comfortable [[00:19:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1194.32s)]
*  to lean into what he has done, which is exposed him to a minimum of $5 million so far. And [[00:20:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1200.4s)]
*  we'll see another big verdict come out of this second defamation trial from E. Jean Carroll. [[00:20:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1207.28s)]
*  But as the numbers show, Chris, as you see, it's starting to very much whittle away, [[00:20:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1212.32s)]
*  I believe, at the support that he may have seen previously with female voters. But look, [[00:20:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1218.8s)]
*  the truly decent ones were never going to support Donald Trump, his misogyny, his disgust for women, [[00:20:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1224.6399999999999s)]
*  the way that he treats them as evidenced by the way that he's treated E. Jean Carroll and others. [[00:20:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1232.08s)]
*  That was never really for the decent women. And so because of that, when you now see that there [[00:20:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1236.4s)]
*  is an accountability alarm that is ringing loud and clear across the country and many different [[00:20:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1242.3200000000002s)]
*  courtrooms, this particular case is the one that bizarrely so he's decided is the one that he's [[00:20:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1248.48s)]
*  going to show up to court for. It's the one that he wants to take the stand for, even though [[00:20:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1255.44s)]
*  he was merely the three minute man today. But it's the one that he's leaning into, [[00:20:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1259.44s)]
*  which makes absolutely no sense. But yet if you stop and you think about it, it kind of does [[00:21:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1263.68s)]
*  because it fits exactly the mold that he broke when he was made. [[00:21:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1267.92s)]
*  Yeah, I want to read because I want to get your feedback on the legal strategy here, [[00:21:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1271.6000000000001s)]
*  because I don't think there is one. I think this is pure ego and insolence. And I think it's also [[00:21:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1276.96s)]
*  just a sense that like no one can hold you accountable. So you have to listen to anyone [[00:21:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1280.8s)]
*  because no one ever has before. And, you know, when they're a star, they let you do what you want, [[00:21:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1284.0s)]
*  like, you know, literal sense. That's what he said in the Access Hollywood tape. In this sense, [[00:21:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1288.4s)]
*  he is acting it out in courtroom with the woman who says he raped her and a civil jury [[00:21:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1292.16s)]
*  substantiated. So he takes a stand. And basically the judge is like, you can't just let him go off. [[00:21:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1297.0400000000002s)]
*  Like, there are rules. And the judge says, I want to know everything he's going to say. And Ms. [[00:21:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1303.44s)]
*  Haba says, I do not have an answer to that other than he stands by his deposition, his testimony, [[00:21:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1306.88s)]
*  the plaintiff brought in. He's going to say he stands by his testimony there. He's going to say [[00:21:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1311.3600000000001s)]
*  he did not make the statements to hurt Ms. Carroll. He's going to say the address spawn, [[00:21:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1315.0400000000002s)]
*  the accusations and deny them. The statements speak from the cells. They've already been put [[00:21:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1318.3200000000002s)]
*  into evidence. And that is 100% of what he would say on the witness stand. I have three questions, [[00:22:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1321.44s)]
*  Your Honor. I just ran through it. Answer my question. I can't tell you. Answer my question. [[00:22:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1326.24s)]
*  I'm not testifying for my client, Your Honor. You are making an offer of proof and your client [[00:22:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1330.0800000000002s)]
*  is bound by it. And so he then gets on and he begins to essentially defame her again and gets [[00:22:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1333.92s)]
*  yanked off. Like, is there some legal chess being played here I'm not getting or is this what it [[00:22:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1339.76s)]
*  looks like? I think you're imputing a little bit too much strategy to some situation wherein it [[00:22:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1345.92s)]
*  doesn't exist. I will say this. So Haba did exactly what her client wanted her to do, which was push [[00:22:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1351.8400000000001s)]
*  boundaries because that's a Donald Trump thing. You want to push the boundaries to see what you [[00:22:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1356.4s)]
*  get away with. But the problem is, is that Donald Trump has been confronted with two significant [[00:22:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1360.8000000000002s)]
*  things in this particular trial. One, E. Jean Carroll. He finally has somebody who's holding [[00:22:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1365.76s)]
*  him to task, holding him to account for what the wrongs that he has done and that he's inflicted [[00:22:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1371.12s)]
*  on someone. The fact that it took someone at her age and that it's a woman to do it is particularly [[00:22:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1376.56s)]
*  significant. But two, he's also been confronted with Judge Lewis Kaplan. So Judge Kaplan in this [[00:23:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1382.32s)]
*  case has had him and Alina Haba on the tightest of leashes and he's not tolerated anything. And [[00:23:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1387.6s)]
*  he's basically said, I'm not going to give you leeway in any capacity. So Alina Haba decided to [[00:23:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1394.6399999999999s)]
*  try, but she couldn't get away with it. And I think it's going to blow up in his face because [[00:23:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1399.92s)]
*  Donald Trump's having this jury that's watching this happen and none of it is positive for Donald [[00:23:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1404.96s)]
*  Trump. Katie Fang, as always a pleasure. Thank you so much. Still ahead, the indicted Republican [[00:23:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1409.04s)]
*  front runner confirms that he is blowing up the Senate border deal so he can campaign on a broken [[00:23:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1416.3200000000002s)]
*  border. More on this remarkable turn of events next. [[00:23:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1422.0s)]
*  There's one thing you hear over and over from swing voters. It's true in interviews you do, [[00:23:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1429.92s)]
*  in polling, in focus groups. Voters who are likely as to be tuned out of politics until [[00:23:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1436.16s)]
*  the election. They say things like both sides need to work together and it just seems like [[00:24:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1440.96s)]
*  they're bickering and they never get anything done. Now the whole value proposition behind a [[00:24:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1444.64s)]
*  Joe Biden presidency, in fact the way that he ran in 2020, is that he can get things done. And he [[00:24:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1449.92s)]
*  has had surprising success on that score as president. He came in after the Capitol [[00:24:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1455.44s)]
*  insurrection, deeply divided Congress, got lower prescription drug costs and climate and infrastructure [[00:24:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1460.3200000000002s)]
*  deals, even gun safety laws, the latter two, passed with bipartisan majorities. And now there [[00:24:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1465.52s)]
*  is another somewhat different example where they have had these bipartisan talks to arrive at a [[00:24:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1470.8s)]
*  border deal. This is something that Biden and the White House had to do in order to get Republicans [[00:24:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1476.48s)]
*  to support funding for Ukraine. And they did it. These were weeks and weeks of talks. The Senate [[00:24:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1482.24s)]
*  started looking at how to fund the compromise deal this week. Now as I said, this is a slightly [[00:24:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1489.36s)]
*  different example of Biden dealmaking. From my perspective, the difference is from what we know [[00:24:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1494.16s)]
*  about this border deal, it looks terrible on the merits. As a top Republican Senate negotiator [[00:24:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1498.96s)]
*  crowed to NBC News this week, quote, it will be by far the most conservative border security bill [[00:25:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1504.72s)]
*  in four decades. Think about that. It would ramp up deportations. It would essentially [[00:25:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1510.4s)]
*  carve up the American promise of asylum in ways that I think are just completely objectionable, [[00:25:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1515.2800000000002s)]
*  which is why, again, Republicans who crafted the deal, including Senators Lindsey Graham and [[00:25:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1521.1200000000001s)]
*  Tom Tillis, are ecstatic about it. They're like, guys, we did it. We solved it. We got what we [[00:25:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1526.64s)]
*  wanted, a conservative border bill. Let's do it. There's a problem. There's a problem, which is [[00:25:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1531.92s)]
*  that they are operating under delusion that actually getting stuff done, even really conservative [[00:25:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1539.2s)]
*  stuff, is the point of governing. Donald Trump does not want that to be the case. And so now, [[00:25:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1543.8400000000001s)]
*  he has come in and is basically trying to kill the deal, telling Republicans to oppose it. [[00:25:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1550.48s)]
*  And the absolutely feckless Mitch McConnell is going to go along with it. He acknowledged to [[00:25:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1556.96s)]
*  his caucus yesterday in a private meeting on the Hill. Why is Trump telling his party members to [[00:26:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1562.96s)]
*  sink an immigration bill that basically gives them everything they want? Senator Mitt Romney [[00:26:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1568.72s)]
*  laid it out for reporters today. I think the border is a very important issue for Donald Trump. [[00:26:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1573.52s)]
*  And the fact that he would communicate to Republican senators and Congress people that he [[00:26:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1579.76s)]
*  doesn't want us to solve the border problem because he wants to blame Biden for it is really appalling. [[00:26:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1586.0s)]
*  Passing legislation that actually does what Republicans want on what they say is an [[00:26:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1593.52s)]
*  existential crisis would then make it a little harder for Trump to attack Joe Biden on the [[00:26:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1599.92s)]
*  campaign trails weak on the border. And that's the Trump candidacy value proposition right there. [[00:26:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1605.68s)]
*  Can't you guys just keep doing nothing? That would work better for me. [[00:26:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1612.16s)]
*  I'm joined now by Congresswoman Katie Porter. She's a Democrat of California, [[00:26:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1616.56s)]
*  as well as a candidate for U.S. Senate in 2024. Congresswoman, obviously these negotiations are [[00:26:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1619.84s)]
*  happening in the Senate, not the House. What is your perspective as you watch this deal, [[00:27:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1626.24s)]
*  which looked like it was a deal attempting to be torn up by Donald Trump? [[00:27:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1632.8799999999999s)]
*  Well, as a member of Congress, this is concerning that we don't seem to have a branch of government, [[00:27:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1638.32s)]
*  the legislative branch that's supposed to be the branch that really solves problems that are on [[00:27:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1644.6399999999999s)]
*  the minds of the American people. What we're seeing from Mitch McConnell and others is that [[00:27:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1648.96s)]
*  they're not willing to do the work of actually solving problems. I don't agree with these [[00:27:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1654.4s)]
*  solutions, but there can be little doubt that this is an effort to try to address challenges at the [[00:27:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1659.52s)]
*  border and for them to be listening to former President Trump, who's not the president, [[00:27:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1665.6000000000001s)]
*  and to be taking his advice about what to do and essentially being beholden to him, [[00:27:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1672.8s)]
*  rather than beholden to their constituents, I think is a big problem for our entire democracy. [[00:27:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1677.36s)]
*  On social media, Trump has sort of made this official that he's calling for it to be sunk. [[00:28:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1683.1999999999998s)]
*  We need a strong power of essentially perfect border. Unless we get that, we're better off [[00:28:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1687.04s)]
*  not making a deal. Even if that pushes our country to temporary close up for a while, [[00:28:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1690.9599999999998s)]
*  I don't even know what that means, of course. But there's also the question of what this would, [[00:28:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1695.36s)]
*  if they work it out in the Senate, would even happen in the House. [[00:28:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1701.12s)]
*  And here's one of your colleagues, Troy Nels, what he had to say about the possibility of it. [[00:28:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1704.4s)]
*  Let's say they work it out in the Senate coming to the House. Take a listen. [[00:28:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1709.12s)]
*  Oh, I'm sorry. Let me read it because it's a full screen. [[00:28:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1714.32s)]
*  Let me tell you, I'm not willing to do too damn much right now to help a Democrat and to help [[00:28:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1717.28s)]
*  Joe Biden's approval rating, he told CNN. I will not help the Democrats try to improve this man's [[00:28:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1721.44s)]
*  dismal approval ratings. I'm not going to do it. Why would I? What do you think of that? [[00:28:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1726.72s)]
*  I think that is a shame. It is a shame that the American people cannot look to their Congress, [[00:28:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1731.1200000000001s)]
*  to one entire party of our political system, to actually do the work that they were elected to do. [[00:28:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1738.4s)]
*  And on top of that, let me just say that the subtext here, and it's not very subtle, I should say, [[00:29:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1744.8000000000002s)]
*  is that immigrants are just political pawns. It completely overlooks the fact that these are real [[00:29:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1750.16s)]
*  people who are coming to the United States seeking a better life and that border communities are [[00:29:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1755.68s)]
*  under strain trying to address that. And so I think for the Republican party to constantly talk [[00:29:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1761.2s)]
*  about and parade in folks from border communities, people who work for Customs and Border Protection, [[00:29:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1767.8400000000001s)]
*  and to tell us they want solutions. And then when we are able to get to an agreement about solutions [[00:29:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1775.28s)]
*  for Trump to tear it up, I think is both disappointing and frankly disgusting. [[00:29:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1781.28s)]
*  Yeah, I mean, it's a good point because again, this is one of those, this is the only area of [[00:29:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1785.6s)]
*  policy they like to talk about. It's also an area in policy in which there have been a record [[00:29:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1790.0s)]
*  setting number of crossings. There are a lot of asylum seekers. There is stress on the system. [[00:29:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1794.8799999999999s)]
*  I think the language they're talking about these folks is utterly dehumanizing and disgusting. [[00:30:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1800.16s)]
*  I think that there's a whole bunch of reasons the asylum system makes us better. I would not have [[00:30:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1804.16s)]
*  their solutions, but it's like it is a recognizable form of politics. Like there's a problem. There's [[00:30:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1808.4s)]
*  an issue. Here's different debates about what to do about it. Here's the possibility of a deal. [[00:30:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1815.8400000000001s)]
*  And the rejection of that says something, it seems to me, about where we're at. [[00:30:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1822.24s)]
*  No, I think that's exactly right. The other part of this that I think is going to be a challenge [[00:30:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1828.0800000000002s)]
*  when it comes over to the House, and I think is actually a problem again, kind of for the structure [[00:30:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1832.48s)]
*  of our democracy, is that this is all tied in to aid for Ukraine. And I think the American people [[00:30:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1837.2s)]
*  need to know where Congress stands on the issues. But when you start putting things that don't make [[00:30:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1842.96s)]
*  any sense together into a deal, then everybody can find a reason both to vote for it or to vote [[00:30:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1848.72s)]
*  against it. And we don't actually learn and we don't reveal to the American people who are about [[00:30:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1855.28s)]
*  to go to the ballot box to vote, we don't actually reveal to them where their representatives stand [[00:30:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1859.6000000000001s)]
*  on delivering solutions. This is a great point. The only reason those two things are linked was [[00:31:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1865.6s)]
*  as a gambit to try to get a vote in the House because Johnson doesn't want to bring up a [[00:31:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1869.6799999999998s)]
*  Ukraine vote and they want some cost for it. Basically, they demanded a cost. We're only going [[00:31:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1875.36s)]
*  to vote for Ukraine aid and let you bring it up if you give us our border bill. So then they had [[00:31:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1880.8s)]
*  negotiations. Now they have the border bill. Now here's this weird package, which I agree with you. [[00:31:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1885.76s)]
*  Why are they linked? Blown up. Well, I think when people say that we should have bipartisanship, [[00:31:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1889.6799999999998s)]
*  and we should work together, they're not talking about this kind of naked political leverage over [[00:31:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1896.08s)]
*  each other, where one of us gives up something entirely like the long-standing obligation of [[00:31:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1902.08s)]
*  this country to help people who are fleeing persecution in order to do something else, [[00:31:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1907.12s)]
*  which is defend our position in terms of democracy and protecting the Ukraine from invasion. That's [[00:31:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1912.32s)]
*  not what we mean by bipartisanship. We mean coming together, finding solutions, not quite agreeing on [[00:31:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1918.56s)]
*  those solutions, and then giving and taking at the margin. That's not what this deal is. [[00:32:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1925.12s)]
*  That's a great, great point. It is a weird machine that got us here. We'll see what happens, [[00:32:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1929.6799999999998s)]
*  Congresswoman Katie Poehler. Thank you. Earlier today, California's governor, [[00:32:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1933.6s)]
*  Gavin Newsom, spoke to Alex Wagner and reacted to the Republican breakdown in immigration. [[00:32:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1940.0s)]
*  I think it is a disgrace what the Republican party is doing, what Donald Trump is doing, [[00:32:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1946.1599999999999s)]
*  and this is hidden in plain sight. He sent out a tweet or some truth whatever, saying, [[00:32:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1950.64s)]
*  kill it. And these guys are so weak, so pathetically weak, this Republican party [[00:32:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1956.0s)]
*  and the new speaker said, oh, yes, sir, what else would you like us to do? We don't care about [[00:32:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1963.44s)]
*  America. We don't care about our freedoms and liberties. We care about politics exclusively [[00:32:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1967.2s)]
*  at the expense of the American people, because all we care about is winning for winning's sake. [[00:32:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1972.0800000000002s)]
*  That is shameful. They busted out the awesome cameras with the focal length. I love that. [[00:32:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1976.4s)]
*  Can we get that next time we do an interview? Much more of Alex's interview with California [[00:33:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1981.92s)]
*  Governor Gavin Newsom, recorded today in South Carolina. It's coming up on Alex Wagner Night [[00:33:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1985.68s)]
*  at the top of the hour. That is going to be fantastic, so definitely stick around for that. [[00:33:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1990.3200000000002s)]
*  Here's this morning's headlines from the Wall Street Journal and other papers. Quote, [[00:33:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=1999.52s)]
*  US shatters expectations. Second headline, the US economy boomed in 2023. Third, US economy grew [[00:33:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2003.6000000000001s)]
*  at a shocking pace. I love that shocking pace. I mean, it's true. It is true. Another day, another [[00:33:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2010.96s)]
*  shockingly good piece of economic news for the country and also for President Joe Biden. [[00:33:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2019.3600000000001s)]
*  Economists had estimated that GDP, that's a measure of basically the total growth of the economy, [[00:33:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2024.3200000000002s)]
*  all goods and services produced, would grow at a rate of about 2% in the fourth quarter of last [[00:33:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2028.4s)]
*  year. Today, we learned that GDP actually grew at a rate of 3.3% during that time. The rate of [[00:33:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2033.04s)]
*  economic growth blew the already quite optimistic prediction out of the water. And once again, [[00:33:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2038.96s)]
*  in what is starting to feel like a weekly tradition, Fox News struggled to cover this [[00:34:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2046.24s)]
*  great news for the economy through almost literally gritted teeth. We'll look through [[00:34:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2050.88s)]
*  this report to see if there are signs that maybe the economy doesn't feel as or isn't as resilient [[00:34:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2056.48s)]
*  as it might seem. What troubles me about this GDP estimate for the fourth quarter is number one, [[00:34:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2062.64s)]
*  it was a holiday quarter. So people are going to push it during the holidays because you don't [[00:34:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2066.96s)]
*  want to tell your kids there's no presence under the tree. The second thing is the government [[00:34:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2070.3199999999997s)]
*  spending, right? I didn't want to say that. Of course. I don't want to say that. So, you know, [[00:34:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2074.08s)]
*  government spending has contributed to this as well. And it's really not helping people. All it's [[00:34:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2078.4s)]
*  done is get us deeper into the inflationary hole. Having said that, these do get revised. [[00:34:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2082.4s)]
*  So let's see what happens. It's seasonally adjusted. They adjust. They adjust for the fourth [[00:34:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2087.6s)]
*  quarter. They know that it's the holidays. Now, despite what she said about inflation, [[00:34:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2092.7999999999997s)]
*  it actually came in at just one point seven percent last quarter, which is actually below [[00:34:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2096.88s)]
*  the Fed's target of about two percent, which is also great news. And it is easy to just see these [[00:35:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2100.88s)]
*  as numbers or restrictions, but they do represent real tangible things out in the world. As Heather [[00:35:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2106.16s)]
*  Long of the Washington Post points out, the economy boomed last year for key three reasons. [[00:35:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2111.04s)]
*  One, consumer spending was way up to government investment in the economy was way up, especially [[00:35:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2115.2s)]
*  among state and local governments. And three, there was a huge uptick in what is called structure [[00:35:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2121.12s)]
*  building for things like factories. And again, as long notes, points two and three are a direct [[00:35:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2126.48s)]
*  result of policy investments from the Biden administration. Point one is due to a strong [[00:35:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2131.6s)]
*  economy, which is also a result of Biden administration policies. None of this is an [[00:35:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2136.48s)]
*  accident. None of it is arbitrary. The Biden administration took proactive steps to grow [[00:35:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2141.04s)]
*  the economy and the economy has boomed. It is not even February yet, but the Biden Harris [[00:35:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2145.6s)]
*  campaign clearly believes with good reason the general election has already started. [[00:35:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2153.84s)]
*  Following Donald Trump's New Hampshire primary win on Tuesday night, President Biden said in [[00:35:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2158.4s)]
*  the statement, it is clear Trump will be his opponent again. One reason why the Biden [[00:36:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2162.32s)]
*  Harris ticket was so successful in 2020 was its ability to unify a Democratic Party that had been [[00:36:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2167.04s)]
*  full of pretty intense internal divisions between its centrist and progressive wings. Achieving that [[00:36:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2172.56s)]
*  unity is much easier to do when you are the challenger rather than the incumbent. In a new [[00:36:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2178.24s)]
*  book, my next guest write about the campaign's struggle to do it again, quote, while bridges [[00:36:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2182.72s)]
*  have been built between left and center, sharp divisions remain in the Democratic ranks. The [[00:36:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2186.88s)]
*  question now is whether the current truce can hold. The Democratic Party is still struggling to find [[00:36:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2191.12s)]
*  itself and the future of the country is hanging in the balance. Hunter Walker is an investigative [[00:36:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2195.52s)]
*  reporter on Talking Points of Mellow. He's been a featuring guest here. Lupe Lupin is the internet's [[00:36:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2200.64s)]
*  favorite lawyer with a dog profile picture, but I followed for 10 years. Together they are co-authors [[00:36:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2204.72s)]
*  of the new book, The Truce, Progressive Centrist and the Future of the Democratic Party, which is [[00:36:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2209.7599999999998s)]
*  out now. Hunter, let me start with you. I like that line about the stakes here because this is [[00:36:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2213.7599999999998s)]
*  really one of these things where the margins matter tremendously. There's a view, I think, across all, [[00:36:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2218.08s)]
*  almost all parts of this broad coalition that this is existential and that Trump is an existential [[00:37:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2223.84s)]
*  threat. And yet, you know, the work of politics of bringing people together is difficult, but [[00:37:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2228.32s)]
*  is happening against the backdrop of very little margin for error. Yeah, I think that's part of [[00:37:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2233.92s)]
*  what drove us to write this book. You know, we all, I think, agree that this is a turning point for [[00:37:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2238.96s)]
*  the country. And it's happening at the same time that the Democrats, who are basically the bulwark [[00:37:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2244.48s)]
*  against Trumpism, are dealing with their own turning point and their own identity crisis. [[00:37:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2249.44s)]
*  So we started to look into, you know, how that dynamic is playing out. And I think what we found [[00:37:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2254.88s)]
*  is that, you know, Joe Biden was remarkably adept at healing the divisions that we saw from 2016. [[00:37:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2260.48s)]
*  These fissures remain. And I think the question is whether he can do it again. But I do think it's a [[00:37:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2266.7200000000003s)]
*  question that is largely one for the future because right now, from top to bottom in the [[00:37:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2271.52s)]
*  progressive movement, they are behind Joe Biden in this election. I think the question is whether [[00:37:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2276.24s)]
*  voters will follow that progressive leadership. That's interesting. What were the things they [[00:38:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2281.2s)]
*  figured out, the different players figured out in 2020? Because I remember, like, 2016 was [[00:38:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2285.6s)]
*  incredibly divisive, that primary went so long, it was divisive along a bunch of different lines of [[00:38:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2290.64s)]
*  division in the party, not just ideological. And it lasted for a while. I think people were having [[00:38:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2296.0s)]
*  2016 fights for years. I mean, literally, really litigating. How did those get sutured together? [[00:38:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2302.16s)]
*  Well, so one of the things we report is that Barack Obama came out of that experience in 2016, [[00:38:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2308.16s)]
*  really committed to this idea of party unity, figuring out how to stitch the party back together. [[00:38:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2314.8799999999997s)]
*  And he took a number of steps that I think we report for the first time to bring the party [[00:38:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2320.08s)]
*  together. We found a speech that he gave behind closed doors in this mansion in the Colorado [[00:38:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2325.92s)]
*  neighborhood to young lawmakers right after they'd taken back the house and were sort of [[00:38:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2331.6s)]
*  settling into their offices in 2019, where he talked about reaching out to younger voters, [[00:38:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2336.64s)]
*  to progressive voters, to making them feel empowered in the campaigns that they were running [[00:39:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2341.2799999999997s)]
*  in and in their offices as well. And we also found that Obama had reached out to the 2020 candidates [[00:39:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2346.7999999999997s)]
*  when they started their campaigns in 2019, talked to them as they were launching their campaign, [[00:39:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2353.12s)]
*  saying, hey, give it your best shot, but you're going to be hearing from me again. [[00:39:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2357.6s)]
*  And there's going to be a moment when we need you to consolidate around a consensus candidate. [[00:39:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2362.4s)]
*  And we found that Obama was making those calls after South Carolina in 2020 and trying to bring [[00:39:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2369.12s)]
*  the party together to get behind Joe Biden. There's also the role of people in Biden world, [[00:39:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2374.08s)]
*  Ron Klain, one of them, and the relationship between the, not just in the campaign, [[00:39:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2382.64s)]
*  but after the campaign between the White House and the Hill. That was quite a functional one, [[00:39:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2388.16s)]
*  I think I got from your book. Yeah. I mean, after that notable assist from Obama, [[00:39:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2393.68s)]
*  there was a real intentionality on the part of Joe Biden and his team to heal the rift that still [[00:39:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2398.72s)]
*  existed from 2016. And that included making these unity task forces with veterans of the Sanders [[00:40:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2405.2799999999997s)]
*  campaign with people like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. And Ron Klain, Biden's initial chief of staff, [[00:40:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2411.2s)]
*  was a leader in that effort. And one of his partners was Pramila Jayapal, head of the [[00:40:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2416.48s)]
*  Congressional Progressive Caucus. And we talked to her. And I think one of the takeaways from there [[00:40:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2420.7999999999997s)]
*  was, A, that progressives actually ended up being more of an ally to Joe Biden than centrists like [[00:40:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2425.8399999999997s)]
*  Joe Manchin and Josh Gottheimer. That was really counterintuitive given how he ran as a staunch [[00:40:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2432.16s)]
*  moderate. But also, Jayapal said she was worried when Klain left. And I think what we see right now [[00:40:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2436.88s)]
*  is this interesting moment on the eve of the new election, where Gaza is almost uniquely suited [[00:40:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2443.6800000000003s)]
*  to put the Democratic coalition in danger. Barack Obama said young voters are the whole ball game. [[00:40:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2449.28s)]
*  We see how upset they are over Biden's handling of this. And Jayapal has expressed similar worries [[00:40:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2454.56s)]
*  and also expressed worries about the new Biden staff. All of this being said, Joe Biden has, [[00:40:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2459.52s)]
*  it's looked bleak for him before, and he kind of always manages to pull it out. [[00:41:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2464.88s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:41:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2468.88s)]
*  He'll really be able to do it again. [[00:41:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2469.12s)]
*  Yeah. It's almost as an issue engineered to cleave the coalition, right? Like, [[00:41:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2470.08s)]
*  people feel very strongly on either side of it within the coalition. But there also is this [[00:41:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2474.1600000000003s)]
*  transactional nature to the Biden administration, I mean, in the best way, where there is this back [[00:41:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2479.12s)]
*  and forth. They just came, promulgated this role where they're going to pause exports of LNG liquid, [[00:41:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2483.52s)]
*  natural gas. Now, this is not making huge headlines, but this is an enormously important thing for [[00:41:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2487.76s)]
*  climate folks who are very focused on this, right? And here's a place where they won this. [[00:41:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2492.32s)]
*  I mean, you know, like, and that's going to matter a huge amount to that coalition. [[00:41:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2497.92s)]
*  Absolutely. And that's another part of the reporting in the book is that there is this [[00:41:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2502.1600000000003s)]
*  coalition building was real in the, not only in the sense of brought the party together in the [[00:41:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2506.32s)]
*  election, but also that it forged relationships between the Biden administration and progressives. [[00:41:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2510.4s)]
*  Hunter talks about Pramila Jayapal and Ron Klain, but you also see figures like Rokana, [[00:41:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2514.56s)]
*  who's a progressive legislator who potentially could have been a presidential candidate in this [[00:42:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2520.56s)]
*  cycle. And who says that, you know, the, who says the, excuse me, who said that this was a really [[00:42:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2524.72s)]
*  big win for the climate, the LNG export ban was a big win for the climate movement. [[00:42:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2534.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's, yeah, I should say not just a win for the movement, but also for the world. It's [[00:42:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2539.36s)]
*  good policy on the merits. Hunter Walker and Lupe Lupin, thank you. Check out The Truce, [[00:42:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMDliewwaVw&t=2543.04s)]
