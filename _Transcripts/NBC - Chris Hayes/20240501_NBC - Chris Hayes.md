# Chris Hayes Why campus protests are 'the easier debate'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I)
*  In the spring of 1969, a group of students at Morehouse College, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=0.0s)]
*  historically back college in Atlanta, were frustrated by what they said was the school's slow progress on civil rights. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=4.0s)]
*  And they protested, they'd been rebuffed. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=10.0s)]
*  So they locked the college trustees in their office for two days and essentially held them hostage. [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=13.0s)]
*  Now, one of the trustees was Martin Luther King, Sr., father of the recently slain civil rights leader. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=19.0s)]
*  He began having chest pains, and one of the students later said, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=26.0s)]
*  we let him out of there so we wouldn't be accused of murder. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=29.0s)]
*  That student and his classmates eventually gave up under a promise of amnesty from the college. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=32.0s)]
*  The college reneged, and he was expelled. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=38.0s)]
*  It would be years before he was rehabilitated, decades before he became known the world over as actor Samuel L. Jackson. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=40.0s)]
*  Now, I tell this story for two reasons. [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=48.0s)]
*  One, to remind us that college activism has long been a part of college education. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=50.0s)]
*  The other reason, though, is to get a sense of proportion, which seems lacking today. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=55.0s)]
*  As we watch the disturbing imagery emerge from campuses at Columbia, UCLA, University of Texas, University of South Florida, [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=60.0s)]
*  so many others, where cops, or in some cases mobs, took down pro-Palestinian student encampments and protests, [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=69.0s)]
*  as well as professors and journalists and just random bystanders. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=77.0s)]
*  The cumulative effect of all this coverage, along with some unverified assertions from police and politicians, [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=83.0s)]
*  has been to drive home the idea that student protests are basically a terrorist-level threat, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=89.0s)]
*  that they have to be neutralized by battalions of cops armed like soldiers with MRAPs and sonic cannons. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=95.0s)]
*  The reason, this seems to me, a reaction that's out of proportion to the protests themselves. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=102.0s)]
*  It seems especially true when you look at some other campuses, like Brown University, [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=111.0s)]
*  where administrators negotiated with student protesters who took down their encampment, [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=115.0s)]
*  and Wesleyan University, whose president said the protesting there was nonviolent and non-disruptive, [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=119.0s)]
*  adding, as long as it continues in this way, the university will not attempt to clear the encampment. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=124.0s)]
*  Now, these universities crucially have reiterated their important existing rules against anti-Semitic invective and harassment, certainly, [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=129.0s)]
*  while also protecting assembly, which seems sensible, also out of step with what you're seeing elsewhere. [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=137.0s)]
*  Because ever since October 7th, when Hamas committed its atrocities in Israel, [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=144.0s)]
*  there has been this obsessive media focus on college campuses. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=149.0s)]
*  And that's true partly because there are genuine issues we're debating, [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=154.0s)]
*  including the degree to which universities are creating spaces that are hostile to pro-Israel Jewish students, [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=158.0s)]
*  where they feel under threat, or universities to the degree to which they're suppressing pro-Palestinian speech. [[00:02:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=164.0s)]
*  And those issues really do matter. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=171.0s)]
*  But the way that so many prominent voices have focused so exclusively on colleges feels, honestly, a bit decadent to me. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=174.0s)]
*  Like we're doing a paper doll version of the conflict, [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=184.0s)]
*  because the actual reality of what's happening in Gaza is so horrific, unceasing and high stakes, [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=188.0s)]
*  it's more enjoyable to argue about what college kids are doing than to confront the human misery and destruction that's happening in the actual conflict. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=194.0s)]
*  That is, of course, the source of these protests. [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=202.0s)]
*  What seems most worth debating isn't campus speech, [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=206.0s)]
*  but whether the U.S. government should continue to fund and support an Israeli war in Gaza that has pushed more than a million people to the brink of famine, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=210.0s)]
*  a war that has damaged half of the buildings in Gaza, [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=218.0s)]
*  a war that has failed to bring home most of the hostages held by Hamas that has in fact led to the death of some of those hostages, [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=221.0s)]
*  as well as the deaths of an estimated 34,000 Palestinians, including roughly 10,000 women and 13,000 children. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=228.0s)]
*  Is that ongoing effort morally defensible? Is it strategically wise? [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=237.0s)]
*  Are we as a nation doing the right or wrong thing and continuing to support it? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=242.0s)]
*  Now, whenever that becomes a question, it almost becomes reflexive to challenge the questioner. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=246.0s)]
*  And I can't help but think of the protests that marked the lead up to the Iraq War, [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=251.0s)]
*  which were both widely attended and widely attacked. [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=255.0s)]
*  And many, many prominent war supporters, including one-time student protester Christopher Hitchens, [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=259.0s)]
*  blasted those demonstrations and he pointed to the fact that some of the people organizing the protests held genuinely odious and fringe views. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=264.0s)]
*  For instance, the view that North Korea is a workers paradise and a great place. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=273.0s)]
*  That's a horrible view. There were protest organizers with bad views, lots of them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=277.0s)]
*  There were people at the protest with terrible views. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=282.0s)]
*  There were people who thought 9-11 was an inside job. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=285.0s)]
*  I would argue with them myself at protests. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=287.0s)]
*  Did that have anything to do at all with whether the war in Iraq was moral and prudent? [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=290.0s)]
*  No, the war in Iraq demonstrably was neither. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=296.0s)]
*  On that, the protesters were right. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=301.0s)]
*  Which brings us back to Columbia University, where 56 years ago, almost to the day, [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=304.0s)]
*  student protesters took over the same building, Hamilton Hall, that was occupied earlier this week. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=309.0s)]
*  They too were forcibly removed and arrested. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=314.0s)]
*  Many were bloodied and beaten. [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=316.0s)]
*  For protesting, among other things, the university's involvement in the Vietnam War. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=318.0s)]
*  They believed the war was a moral catastrophe and the U.S. should stop waging it. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=323.0s)]
*  They were right. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=328.0s)]
*  And the fact that there were absolutely genuine extremists among those protesters in 68, [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=330.0s)]
*  again, had no bearing on whether they were right or not about that. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=335.0s)]
*  What I find particularly maddening about our focus on the protesters of the conflict is that it's an invasion. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=339.0s)]
*  It avoids the difficult task of being universally empathetic to our fellow human beings [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=345.0s)]
*  and truly reckoning with the scale of devastation that is wrought by our country, in our names, with our support. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=351.0s)]
*  In the aftermath of 9-11, we waged a global war on terror for two decades that killed an estimated 430,000 people. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=358.0s)]
*  Many of them children, women, elderly, innocents. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=366.0s)]
*  In Vietnam, we are estimated to have killed more than a million people. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=370.0s)]
*  Huge swaths of them civilians, women, children, male-bound combatants, old people, and the like. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=374.0s)]
*  Can you even make sense of those numbers? [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=380.0s)]
*  I can't. No one can. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=382.0s)]
*  It's hard to think of them, to contend with them as actual real human beings who lived lives before you took them, [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=384.0s)]
*  who were people like you and I, who were loved by the people in their lives. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=389.0s)]
*  It is much easier to get angry at the spoiled brats on college campuses. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=394.0s)]
*  Why are they being so disruptive? What are they so upset about? [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=398.0s)]
*  If you feel that way, which I can understand, honestly. [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=402.0s)]
*  I've felt irritation and anger at protesters many times in my life, even ones I was ostensibly on the same side as, broadly speaking. [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=405.0s)]
*  If you feel that way, just try recasting the question. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=411.0s)]
*  Why are all these people so upset that we're helping a government wager brutal war that's killed 13,000 children? [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=414.0s)]
*  The question kind of answers itself. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=422.0s)]
*  To take seriously the scale of human suffering that's happening in Gaza doesn't mean you must come down the side of the protesters, certainly. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=426.0s)]
*  There are many people who think the war is a brutal but necessary campaign for Israel's defense. [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=433.0s)]
*  What it does necessitate is that you weigh all the human suffering against the actual endgame of the conflict that is currently being waged and is unarticulated as of now. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=438.0s)]
*  A conflict the U.S. continues to support. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=449.0s)]
*  Our humanity demands we focus on those questions, first and last. [[00:07:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LZi7gxXEh5I&t=452.0s)]
