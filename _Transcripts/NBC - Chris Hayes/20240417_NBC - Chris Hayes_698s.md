# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: April 16
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 17, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI)
*  Mr. Rubin is an MSNBC legal correspondent, has been watching the trial unfold from inside [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=0.0s)]
*  the courthouse. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=5.0s)]
*  Katherine Christian spent over 30 years as a prosecutor in that office, Manhattan District [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=6.0s)]
*  Attorney's Office, and they will join me now. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=10.200000000000001s)]
*  Great to have you here. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=12.280000000000001s)]
*  Let's, can we start with the moment with the juror and the Trump saying something within, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=14.040000000000001s)]
*  in the words of Judge Marshawn, 12 feet of the juror in the response. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=21.52s)]
*  Just take me through that. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=24.36s)]
*  So Judge Marshawn, after that juror left the stand, essentially, she was being questioned, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=26.08s)]
*  after she left and Judge Marshawn decided he was not going to excuse her for cause, [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=32.64s)]
*  he said, I have something that I want to put on the record. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=37.599999999999994s)]
*  And that's when he said, Mr. Blanche, your client, while this prospective juror was sitting [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=40.839999999999996s)]
*  no more than 12 feet away from him, was audibly saying something and looking in her direction. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=46.56s)]
*  I couldn't quite make out what it was. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=53.76s)]
*  This is Marshawn saying this. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=55.8s)]
*  I couldn't quite make out what it was. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=57.08s)]
*  But I want you to understand that witness intimidation will not be tolerated in my courtroom. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=59.4s)]
*  Have a talk with your client. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=65.75999999999999s)]
*  Again, I'm going to do my check-in that I always do, Katherine, with you, who practiced [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=67.0s)]
*  for 30 years in that office. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=71.8s)]
*  Like a common thing in voir dire to have the defendant like audibly saying things to the [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=73.03999999999999s)]
*  jurors. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=79.67999999999999s)]
*  No, only the, and I'm not making light of this, only the mentally unwell ones. [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=80.67999999999999s)]
*  That's the only time you see criminal defense acting out, literally. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=83.8s)]
*  In that kind of situation. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=87.08s)]
*  And then it's sort of, you understand it. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=88.08s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=89.24s)]
*  It's someone who, for some deep psychological medical reason, literally can't control themselves. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=90.24s)]
*  Exactly. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=94.39999999999999s)]
*  And that's really the only case. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=95.39999999999999s)]
*  That's the only time you ever see that. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=96.39999999999999s)]
*  I will say that having watched both Eugene Carroll trials, the first of which Donald [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=98.28s)]
*  Trump did not attend, the second of which he did attend, there were some episodes that [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=102.24s)]
*  were reminiscent of what happened today. [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=106.28s)]
*  I don't recall them happening during jury selection themselves, but there were times [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=108.12s)]
*  when lawyers were speaking in the courtroom and he disagreed vociferously with what they [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=112.72s)]
*  were saying. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=115.8s)]
*  And for demonstrative effect, Donald Trump pounded the table or shook his head or crossed [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=117.04s)]
*  his arms to indicate his vigorous disagreement with what was being said. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=122.5s)]
*  And we all know how that story ended. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=127.32s)]
*  None of the jurors were positively impacted by that performance. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=129.84s)]
*  In fact, there were jurors in that case who I thought were not at all partial to Eugene [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=134.12s)]
*  Carroll, who looked the other way when her lawyer, Robbie Kaplan, was closing. [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=139.04s)]
*  I really thought that something might happen that we weren't expecting. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=142.84s)]
*  And yet, unanimously, they found for her. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=148.04s)]
*  So that's a long way of saying you can't always read into prospective jurors or jurors' behavior [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=150.79999999999998s)]
*  just based on what a defendant does in the courtroom. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=156.0s)]
*  So I'm going to start with where we are and then work backwards to how we got here. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=158.57999999999998s)]
*  So as of today, we've got seven jurors sworn in. [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=163.32s)]
*  Now, again, this is not my thing. [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=166.28s)]
*  It's remarkable. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=169.24s)]
*  It seems to me so fast. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=171.2s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=173.07999999999998s)]
*  This is, Judge Machan is known as a fair and efficient judge. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=174.07999999999998s)]
*  This is remarkable because this type of defendant, meaning very high profile that people have [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=177.64s)]
*  strong opinions, this is very remarkable that he was able to, Judge Machan, get seven jurors, [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=182.84s)]
*  which means he only needs five more for the 12 and an additional six for the alternates. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=190.35999999999999s)]
*  He also worked overtime today, Judge Machan. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=194.96s)]
*  Courts closed at 4.30. [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=197.24s)]
*  He worked to 5.30. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=198.76s)]
*  So it shows that he's, we're going to do this by Thursday. [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=199.98s)]
*  And he probably will, unless something happens and, you know, things happen. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=203.26s)]
*  But I think there will be a complete jury by the end of the day on Thursday. [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=207.16s)]
*  Now, just to benchmark this, we had a former New York judge sitting in that chair, Judge [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=210.84s)]
*  Kiesel, on Thursday, I believe. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=216.04s)]
*  And she was looking at this saying, like, I don't know, man, this could be a few weeks. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=218.56s)]
*  And you know what? [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=221.96s)]
*  She's a friend of mine. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=223.32s)]
*  In fact, there's only one other judge in that courthouse who would get a jury as fast as [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=225.07999999999998s)]
*  this judge, Judge Pickles-Hillel. [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=228.72s)]
*  So it's, it just, he has done a remarkable job, Judge Machan. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=230.92s)]
*  Okay. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=235.28s)]
*  So the process today, so we already got the 50 who said, I can't. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=236.28s)]
*  Correct. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=240.12s)]
*  It's Donald Trump. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=241.12s)]
*  Forget it. [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=242.12s)]
*  I think it was probably the subtext. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=243.12s)]
*  And even some more, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=244.68s)]
*  Because there were not people who took themselves out off the top, but came back. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=245.76s)]
*  And when they were ready to take the jury questionnaire, basically said, you know, [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=249.56s)]
*  I thought about it overnight. [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=252.88s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=254.24s)]
*  So that's, so that's two, like two cuts, right? [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=255.24s)]
*  So you've got like the, I can't do it. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=257.4s)]
*  Then I thought about it for a night. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=258.48s)]
*  I can't do it. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=259.48s)]
*  Then you have people like, I can do it. [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=260.48s)]
*  And then you've got this to me, slightly comical spectacle of Trump's lawyers and legal team [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=261.48s)]
*  furiously checking out the social media profile of these people. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=270.0s)]
*  And in a number of cases finding, you know, someone posted an AI video of Trump saying, [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=274.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm a dumb F word. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=280.96s)]
*  Someone else on the day that I think the election was declared on Facebook being like, hunt [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=283.48s)]
*  that horse, baby. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=288.52s)]
*  Lots of memes about Trump being a buffoon or bad or dumb, being read into court from [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=291.52s)]
*  the perspective jurors. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=297.12s)]
*  I'm just, what was that like? [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=299.15999999999997s)]
*  It was fascinating because on some level, some of them you could see really were legitimately [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=302.26s)]
*  struck for cause. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=307.8s)]
*  So I'll give you an example. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=308.8s)]
*  There was someone who relevant to the events at issue here had posted something on Facebook [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=309.8s)]
*  saying get him out and lock him up. [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=314.92s)]
*  Oh yeah. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=318.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=319.28000000000003s)]
*  That person can't stay. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  I think we are all agree. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=321.28000000000003s)]
*  Like, nope, can't be on the jury. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=322.28000000000003s)]
*  Okay. [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=323.92s)]
*  And the person with the AI video was the other person to go. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=324.92s)]
*  But let's talk about the woman with the horn. [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=328.6s)]
*  That woman, when she was brought in for questioning said, well, let me put it into some context [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=331.28000000000003s)]
*  for you. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=335.12s)]
*  I took that video watching what was happening in my neighborhood because election night [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=336.72s)]
*  felt historic to me. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=339.64s)]
*  And it was also evocative of the nightly seven o'clock cheer that we did in New York for [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=341.0s)]
*  emergency workers and healthcare workers during that period of time in 2020. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=347.12s)]
*  And I wanted to remember. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=351.64s)]
*  Documented. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=353.28000000000003s)]
*  Correct. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=354.28000000000003s)]
*  And she said, I documented it, you know, sitting here today, do I believe that I can be fair [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=355.28000000000003s)]
*  unequivocally? [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=359.32s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=360.32s)]
*  And Rashad said, look, I have the power under our case law to take her out her word and I'm [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=361.32s)]
*  going to. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=364.44s)]
*  She was struck with a peremptory challenge, but not for cause. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=365.52s)]
*  Right. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=368.91999999999996s)]
*  Peremptory means again, just to remind you, you get, they each get 10 where you could [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=369.91999999999996s)]
*  just strike people for any reason. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=373.64s)]
*  And if Trump is convicted, they will appeal on that, that they were denied that cause [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=375.44s)]
*  and had to use their peremptory challenge. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=379.56s)]
*  They will lose that because Judge Michonne, as Lisa said, struck other people and didn't [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=381.47999999999996s)]
*  even wait for cause. [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=387.12s)]
*  It just says you're gone and also struck people who self-identified that they couldn't be [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=388.12s)]
*  fair. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=393.28s)]
*  There is no appealable issue assuming Donald Trump is convicted on the jury selection. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=394.76s)]
*  Chris, can I point out something else too that's unusual about today? [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=399.55999999999995s)]
*  Because as a person who practiced primarily in federal courts, I find New York State Court [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=402.67999999999995s)]
*  voir dire, that's the questioning of the prospective jurors, fascinating because it's conducted [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=406.52s)]
*  by the lawyers. [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=411.08s)]
*  It reads like watching a focus group conducted by two different lawyers where they're like, [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=412.11999999999995s)]
*  here are some themes that are important to me or here's some issues I really care about. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=417.88s)]
*  What do you think about that juror number one? [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=421.52s)]
*  What do you think about that juror number two? [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=423.48s)]
*  You know that Lee Greenwood song, Proud to be American? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=425.08000000000004s)]
*  Hey, you like that song? [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=427.08000000000004s)]
*  You like the Lee Greenwood song? [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=428.08000000000004s)]
*  But for Todd Blanch, it was an opportunity to connect with them and to try and get from [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=429.56s)]
*  them what is your opinion of Donald Trump when they didn't want to give it and to have [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=434.28000000000003s)]
*  to be friendly? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=438.40000000000003s)]
*  Very interesting. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=439.40000000000003s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, Kathryn Christian, great to have you. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=440.40000000000003s)]
*  We'll have you back again soon. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=443.20000000000005s)]
*  Back in 2020 during the George Floyd protests, a United States Senator penned a controversial [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=446.28000000000003s)]
*  in the New York Times calling for the U.S. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=451.56s)]
*  military to be brought in to crush the protests in the streets, claiming those demonstrations [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=453.72s)]
*  were shot through with, quote, cadres of left-wing radicals like Antifa. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=458.40000000000003s)]
*  That was, of course, Republican Senator Tom Cotton of Arkansas. [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=464.08000000000004s)]
*  And that essay was hugely controversial, led to a revolt among staff at the Times where [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=467.20000000000005s)]
*  leaders concluded it should not have been published. [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=471.88s)]
*  The top opinion editor ultimately resigned over the publishing of it. [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=474.40000000000003s)]
*  We would later find out from an editor who actually worked on Cotton's essay, a self-identified [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=478.32s)]
*  conservative editor, that he had to soften Cotton's first draft by deleting, quote, [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=482.68s)]
*  several objectionable sentences and adding that Cotton's desire for essentially mass [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=488.48s)]
*  violence on American streets by the state should not apply to, quote, peaceful protesters. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=494.0s)]
*  The result was still pretty objectionable. [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=500.48s)]
*  Raise the question, how much worse is Tom Cotton when he doesn't have an editor trying [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=503.15999999999997s)]
*  to save him from himself? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=507.78s)]
*  Turns out there is an answer. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=509.97999999999996s)]
*  Because yesterday he posted this, quote, I encourage people who get stuck behind the [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=511.21999999999997s)]
*  pro-Hamas mobs blocking traffic. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=515.66s)]
*  Take matters into your own hands. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=518.54s)]
*  It's time to put an end to this nonsense. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=522.06s)]
*  That's a sitting U.S. Senator. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=525.4599999999999s)]
*  What he is calling pro-Hamas mobs are Americans, including from many Jewish groups, who are [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=527.42s)]
*  protesting and calling for a ceasefire in Gaza. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=532.06s)]
*  According to most polls, that's not even a radical sentiment in America. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=536.2199999999999s)]
*  A majority of Americans actually want to ceasefire. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=538.9399999999999s)]
*  And Tom Cotton sure seems like he's calling for vigilante street violence against those [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=542.86s)]
*  people when they protest. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=548.68s)]
*  Wildly reckless, despicable behavior out of an elected official. [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=550.54s)]
*  So a few minutes after publishing it, he edited the post to clarify that you should take matters [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=554.38s)]
*  into your own hands, quote, to get them out of the way. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=559.3199999999999s)]
*  Much better, right? [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=562.9599999999999s)]
*  I got to say, even by the quite debased standards of our day, this is just crazy, explicit incitement [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=565.62s)]
*  to violence by a sitting U.S. Senator. [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=573.58s)]
*  Also a good reminder of what happened back in 2020 when Senator Tom Cotton wanted to [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=577.38s)]
*  crush the protesters with military might. [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=580.74s)]
*  A Boston Globe investigation found that the 16 months after George Floyd's death, drivers [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=584.02s)]
*  rammed their cars and trucks into protesters at least 139 times. [[00:09:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=588.38s)]
*  They recorded three deaths and 100 injuries, including concussions and broken bones. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=593.28s)]
*  You've got to ask, is that what Tom Cotton means by taking matters into your own hands, [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=597.8399999999999s)]
*  running people over? [[00:10:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=602.48s)]
*  Wait, there's another edit. [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=603.88s)]
*  Today Cotton posted a demonstration of the violence he actually wants against peaceful [[00:10:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=606.36s)]
*  protesters saying that this is, quote, how it should be done. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=610.4399999999999s)]
*  Catch a little kick to the peaceful protesters face at the end. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=623.28s)]
*  That's how Tom Cotton wants it done. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=638.24s)]
*  Most of us, I think, have that inner voice, that internal editor, if you will, that reminds [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=641.1999999999999s)]
*  us to be decent and humane to each other, even in really frustrating, trying circumstances, [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=646.12s)]
*  sitting in traffic behind a protest. [[00:10:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=651.08s)]
*  But for years now, a different, darker impulse has been pushed on Americans by people with [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=653.76s)]
*  no internal editor, people with no capacity and no use for empathy. [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=657.9200000000001s)]
*  And some of them are even United States senators. [[00:11:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4zIoD1R7eI&t=662.22s)]
