# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights Aug. 4
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [August 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Well for Donald Trump the stakes of the next presidential election are clear [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=0.0s)]
*  We all know he is running for his freedom [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  To put an even finer point on it. He's running for his life [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=10.0s)]
*  I mean the ex-president now faces 78 criminal counts across three jurisdictions and a combined [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=14.64s)]
*  641 years in prison at age 77 if he is convicted of any of these offenses just one [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=21.36s)]
*  He could spend the rest of his natural life behind bars [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=27.44s)]
*  The stakes for the country are equally dire [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=31.44s)]
*  Donald Trump tried to end America's constitutional republic and we know that and have known that for a while [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=35.08s)]
*  From the facts as they are alleged in the most recent federal indictment the facts as they are laid out in the [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=40.32s)]
*  840 page select committee report and the facts as we all witnessed them with our own two eyes [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=47.0s)]
*  In the run-up to and on the day of January 6, 2021 [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=54.68s)]
*  Had Donald Trump convinced enough people to go along with his scheme [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=59.519999999999996s)]
*  we could be living right now in a kind of presidential dictatorship and [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=63.96s)]
*  He has explicitly said and signaled multiple times that he is running again to finish the job. I [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=68.2s)]
*  Will appoint a real special prosecutor to go after the most corrupt president in the history of the United States of America [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=75.64s)]
*  Joe Biden [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=84.2s)]
*  And the entire Biden crime family name a special prosecutor [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=86.68s)]
*  And all others involved with the destruction of our elections our borders and our country itself [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=93.68s)]
*  They're destroying our country and when I'm reelected and we will get reelected. We have no choice. We're not gonna have a country [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=100.16000000000001s)]
*  Anymore, I will totally obliterate the deep state. We will obliterate [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=107.64000000000001s)]
*  The deep state [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=114.04s)]
*  The ex-president now finds himself cornered legally. He's mostly alone. You notice that [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=116.64s)]
*  None of his family members by his side. He's unable to summon the mobs [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=122.16000000000001s)]
*  He once was and he's been denuded of the official power of the presidency [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=126.32000000000001s)]
*  He's smaller in many ways. It's not getting any younger and he's attempting to threaten his way through [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=130.8s)]
*  In a post this afternoon. He threatened apparently his prosecutors [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=137.4s)]
*  Writing if you go after me, I'm coming after you [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=142.20000000000002s)]
*  If he is elected next year Donald Trump could very well escape accountability [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=146.16000000000003s)]
*  That's the plan of him and his advisors to get elected and then avoid facing trial on the dozens of charges [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=149.98000000000002s)]
*  he faces or drop the charges or avoid sentencing and then upon taking office he would set about the task of [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=156.04000000000002s)]
*  Completing the unfinished work of January 6, which was the work of destroying American democracy as the New York Times reported last month [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=162.88000000000002s)]
*  Trump and his allies are planning a sweeping expansion of presidential power over the machinery of government [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=170.88s)]
*  Reshaping the structure of the executive branch to concentrate far greater authority directly in his hands [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=177.0s)]
*  includes bringing independent agencies under direct presidential control [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=182.64s)]
*  Reviving the practices of impounding funds refusing to spend money Congress is appropriated for programs of president doesn't like [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=187.16s)]
*  Making it easier to replace career civil servants removing State Department intelligence agency officials [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=193.84s)]
*  He describes as the sick political class that hates our country [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=199.4s)]
*  now [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=203.4s)]
*  Let's be clear a lot of this is tough talk [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=204.44s)]
*  from a guy who's [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=207.96s)]
*  In a lot of trouble, you know hitting out the caps lock on his truth social posts [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=209.72s)]
*  but [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=215.96s)]
*  You got to take it seriously [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=217.32s)]
*  If you've ever seen an image of what happened on January 6, right? [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=219.52s)]
*  The guy's running for president. He could win imagine how our system of justice would run in that world. I [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=223.96s)]
*  Mean really it's [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=228.79999999999998s)]
*  Hard to think about but it could happen taking the oath. He's elected the president. Maybe he would [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=230.79999999999998s)]
*  Pardon his as yet unindicted co-conspirator. Jeffrey Clark and finally succeed installing that guy's attorney general [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=237.28s)]
*  Not a particularly far-fetched idea if Donald Trump wins the presidency again [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=245.44s)]
*  He could not be making it more clear that he intends to defeat [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=250.56s)]
*  American democracy once and for all if he is given the means and [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=254.44s)]
*  Obviously obviously obviously it goes out saying even though I have to say it that a man like that should not be allowed anywhere [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=258.52s)]
*  Near the levers of power that was clear to me and many of you eight years ago when he came down the escalator [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=264.76s)]
*  And there are mechanisms to stop him short of putting him in present prison for the rest of his natural life [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=270.36s)]
*  First of all, there's a really good case to be made [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=275.71999999999997s)]
*  He should be barred from holding office under the 14th Amendment of the Constitution [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=278.56s)]
*  Section 3 of which states and I quote no person shall hold any office who having previously taken an oath to support the Constitution the [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=283.24s)]
*  United States like the president shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same and [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=291.16s)]
*  There's been a movement [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=298.12s)]
*  Spring up to try to bar his reelection on precisely these grounds lawsuits of the courts or legislation [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=299.76s)]
*  And I gotta say it hasn't got a ton of attention, but I think it has a lot of merit [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=305.32s)]
*  I think Donald Trump plainly engaged in insurrection and plainly should therefore be ineligible for future office [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=309.76s)]
*  Per the US Constitution. I think the original intent of that amendment would see it that way, too [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=316.55999999999995s)]
*  But of course, there's another way that he could be barred from future office and that's impeachment. Remember that one [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=324.28s)]
*  After January 6 Donald Trump was impeached in the house for the second time first president ever [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=330.88s)]
*  he could have been convicted in the Senate and [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=335.52s)]
*  Pursuant to the conviction barred from holding future office [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=338.71999999999997s)]
*  Seven members of his own party voted for that conviction. It was the most [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=341.96s)]
*  bipartisan support for an impeachment conviction in the history of this nation [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=346.32s)]
*  At one point even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was reportedly [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=351.24s)]
*  considering voting to convict [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=356.47999999999996s)]
*  But when it came down to it McConnell just washed his hands of the whole thing [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=358.64000000000004s)]
*  Shrugged told the country not my job to hold Donald Trump accountable, but you know, maybe someone else should do it [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=364.32s)]
*  Our system of government gave the Senate a specific task [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=372.96000000000004s)]
*  The Constitution gives us a particular role [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=378.28000000000003s)]
*  This body is not invited to act as the nation's [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=382.08s)]
*  overarching moral tribunal [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=385.68s)]
*  President Trump is still liable for everything he did while he was in office [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=388.68s)]
*  As an ordinary citizen [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=394.28s)]
*  Unless the statute of limitations is run still liable for everything he did while he's in office [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=396.28s)]
*  Didn't get away with anything yet [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=404.12s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=407.56s)]
*  Yeah [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=410.12s)]
*  We have a criminal justice system in this country [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=412.64s)]
*  We have civil litigation and [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=416.24s)]
*  Former presidents are not immune from being accountable by either one all these guys. They're also tough aren't they at their lecterns? [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=419.08s)]
*  stern [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=427.52s)]
*  hectoring [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=428.96s)]
*  posting in caps lock Mitch McConnell [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=430.52s)]
*  He's not out of the woods yet bravely standing on the Senate floor [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=433.2s)]
*  To dump the problem of a sociopathic [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=438.24s)]
*  maniacal hater of American democracy on someone else someone else should so what you know, you should really do something about this guy and [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=443.48s)]
*  Thereby allowing the ex-president to escape accountability and the obvious punishment for his crimes [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=451.96s)]
*  Which is to bar him from running for office again [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=457.48s)]
*  where he can now do so and threaten the Republic and [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=460.03999999999996s)]
*  Mitch McConnell voted to acquit Donald Trump. He told Republicans to vote their conscience and all but seven voted to acquit [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=464.20000000000005s)]
*  so [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=471.32s)]
*  Now that someone else has actually done the thing that McConnell said they should do [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=474.04s)]
*  Held him liable for his alleged crimes under our system of justice gosh [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=478.20000000000005s)]
*  Haven't heard a lot from Mitch [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=483.12s)]
*  He seems silent on the matter [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=486.40000000000003s)]
*  To be clear we are where we are [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=489.68s)]
*  With both accountability for Donald Trump and the fate of the American constitutional republic. I'm not overstating things [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=493.88s)]
*  hanging in the balance a toss-up [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=501.12s)]
*  Because Mitch McConnell and all the Senate Republicans and the whole Republican Party just refused to do the obvious simple and straightforward thing [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=504.12s)]
*  They could have just convicted him [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=512.8000000000001s)]
*  We wouldn't be here [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=516.04s)]
*  But they refused to convict him for inciting the violent insurrection that [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=517.56s)]
*  Concussed a bunch of police officers and threatened the life of the vice president [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=521.84s)]
*  The insurrection that went on for hours violently in front of us for which over a thousand people have been charged that we all watched happen [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=526.24s)]
*  The one that he incited that we knew he incited they could have convicted him for that and they could have barred him for holding future office [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=534.28s)]
*  But they didn't and so then we now have them to thank [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=540.0799999999999s)]
*  For this image remember this one pretty hard to forget [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=543.22s)]
*  Former Trump Justice Department official Jeffrey Bossert Clark in his underwear last year when the FBI executed a search warrant on his home [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=546.78s)]
*  They see it to cell phone as part of their sprawling inquiry into Donald Trump's attempts to seal the election [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=555.74s)]
*  Mr. Clark who were pretty sure is co-conspirator number four in Trump's indictment [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=560.94s)]
*  And here in the body cam footage obtained as federal agents searched his home he looks well rather comical and just a bit pathetic [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=566.34s)]
*  Can you step outside with me? We've got a search warrant and we need to speak to you. Can I get you to step outside for me? [[00:09:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=573.7s)]
*  Can I call my lawyer? Sure. Come on outside. Yeah, let's step outside. Just real quick. We got to clear the house. Can I put pants on first? [[00:09:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=579.7s)]
*  Sure. We got to clear the house. We're gonna clear the house. We're gonna make sure to take one. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=586.58s)]
*  As soon as we clear the house we'll get to talk to your lawyer and we'll get some information on your lawyer. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=589.22s)]
*  That entire scene is somewhat indelible because if you look at Jeffrey Clark's bio anytime before 2020 it would be entirely unremarkable. [[00:09:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=592.42s)]
*  Went to law school, clerked for an appeals court judge after law school, worked at a white collar law firm. [[00:09:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=599.86s)]
*  He headed the Justice Department's environmental division during the George W. Bush administration. [[00:10:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=604.74s)]
*  Served as an advisor for Mitt Romney's 2020-12 presidential campaign. [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=610.3399999999999s)]
*  He was a prominent member of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group that stocks the judicial branch with conservative judges as well as Republican administrations. [[00:10:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=616.3399999999999s)]
*  He was, before working for Donald J. Trump, before 2020, quintessential Republican Washington lawyer. [[00:10:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=622.3399999999999s)]
*  But Jeffrey Clark is also this key figure who wanted to take over the Department of Justice in 2020. [[00:10:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=628.1s)]
*  And he wanted to throw the world into the hands of the people who were in the Department of Justice in 2020. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=634.1s)]
*  He was also this key figure who wanted to take over the Department of Justice in 2020. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=640.1s)]
*  And he wanted to throw the weight of the DOJ behind Trump's coup by sending letters to swing states to tell them the election was not trustworthy. [[00:10:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=644.34s)]
*  And that the state should send their own electors electing Donald Trump. [[00:10:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=653.78s)]
*  When Justice Department officials, his bosses, wouldn't bend to Trump's will. [[00:10:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=659.7s)]
*  Trump tried to install Clark in a kind of mini coup at the DOJ as the acting attorney general in a bid to remain in power so that Clark could send those letters out and have the DOJ help with the coup. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=666.1800000000001s)]
*  And Clark's starring role in the conspiracy to subvert American democracy is detailed in the indictment. [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=678.58s)]
*  Clark's not named, but he sure does match the description of co-conspirator four. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=684.26s)]
*  When Clark was confronted with the ramifications of trying to steal the election, things took a turn according to the indictment. [[00:11:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=689.46s)]
*  On page 30, federal prosecutors described the moment three days before the attempted coup. [[00:11:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=696.42s)]
*  Quote, on the afternoon of January 3rd, when Clark spoke with a deputy White House counsel, he tried to dissuade Clark from assuming the role of acting attorney general. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=702.42s)]
*  The deputy White House counsel reiterated to Clark that there had not been outcome deterrent of fraud in the election. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=711.46s)]
*  That if Trump remained in office, nonetheless, there would be riots in every major city in the United States. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=717.78s)]
*  Clark responded, well, that's why there's an insurrection act. [[00:12:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=723.14s)]
*  And that, I submit to you, is the most chilling line in the entire indictment. [[00:12:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=727.86s)]
*  Jeffrey Clark, according to it, wanted to use the U.S. military to use force, their guns, bullets in the streets on the American people so as to install a dictatorship under Donald J. Trump, according to prosecutors. [[00:12:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=731.7s)]
*  To be clear, the insurrection act is an 1807 law that allows the president to deploy the military to stop an uprising. [[00:12:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=745.94s)]
*  That's the big culmination of the entire conspiracy. That's the fantasy that Jeffrey Clark had. [[00:12:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=753.22s)]
*  It was what Clark and others wanted Trump to invoke. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=759.14s)]
*  And when I read that line, the indictment, I thought of Hannah Arendt's infamous line about the banality of evil. [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=762.7399999999999s)]
*  As I looked at this middle-aged lawyer in his boxers and his glasses, fantasizing about what those big, bad troops would do with their guns, how they would shove a dictatorship down the throats of the American people. [[00:12:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=769.3s)]
*  You would think the revelations of his role in the conspiracy would have destroyed his career, but in fact, it's been the opposite. [[00:13:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=783.38s)]
*  He has become a celebrated MAGA figure because the explicit goal of the MAGA movement in action and word is for the Jeffrey Clark vision to come true, to end American democracy. [[00:13:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=788.9s)]
*  And it's more than a little troubling how many lifelong Republican lawyers were in on this plot. [[00:13:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=800.66s)]
*  Congresswoman Madeline Dean is a Democrat of Pennsylvania. She served as a manager in the second impeachment trial of Donald Trump. She joins me now. [[00:13:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=806.34s)]
*  Well, have you thought about that impeachment as much as I have been in the last few days? [[00:13:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=815.38s)]
*  Oh, I've thought about it an awful lot, Chris. Thank you for having me on. [[00:13:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=821.38s)]
*  You're absolutely right. And we as managers, as we prepared the case with the able lead of Jamie Raskin, [[00:13:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=826.1s)]
*  so faithful to the Constitution, we really believed that this evidence was so overwhelming that, of course, 100 senators should have voted guilty. [[00:13:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=835.8599999999999s)]
*  We knew what was going on politically, but what we wanted was for a guilty verdict and then the opportunity, as you say, to disqualify him by way of a separate vote for further office. [[00:14:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=848.8199999999999s)]
*  You're absolutely right. There were other constitutional means, the 14th Amendment within subrection, the 25th Amendment. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=860.42s)]
*  And we have learned that some secretaries did begin to speak about disqualifying him, showing that he was unfit for office. [[00:14:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=866.42s)]
*  The founders gave us these levers, the break the glass levers in the case of this level of corruption and criminality. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=874.8199999999999s)]
*  And I have to tell you, that last day, when each member of the Senate, you know how they did it, they stood to cast their votes. [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=883.4200000000001s)]
*  I went running back in from the little war room where we prepared to see and watch and listen to their votes. [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=891.4200000000001s)]
*  And I watched as Mitch McConnell stood in his place, said not guilty, sat down. [[00:14:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=899.34s)]
*  When we went back to the war room within minutes of the conclusion of that vote, as you say, 57-43, Mitch McConnell stood and gave a prepared speech that said the president is practically and morally responsible, effectively speaking out of both sides of his mouth. [[00:15:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=905.34s)]
*  I think about it a lot. [[00:15:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=925.34s)]
*  Yeah, it's a very stirring speech after he just voted not guilty. [[00:15:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=927.34s)]
*  And what is important to me is we face ourselves with this remarkable situation, right? [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=931.34s)]
*  The multiple indictments and the most important to me, obviously, Jack Smith's indictment for the crimes as laid out in the impeachment and then in the select committees report. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=937.34s)]
*  That, you know, criminal conviction is not the only means at our disposal. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=946.34s)]
*  The Constitution contemplates precisely the most appropriate sanction here before this whole thing. [[00:15:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=951.34s)]
*  We got to this point, which is disqualification. [[00:15:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=959.34s)]
*  Like, it is contemplated by the Constitution, the notion that certain people should be barred from office. [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=962.34s)]
*  And if ever such a person existed, it seems to me this man is he. [[00:16:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=967.34s)]
*  You know, I was thinking as we were preparing the case and when I would be off and not having a role, but just would be observing and preparing, I was thinking I was praying, frankly, that the members of the Senate would have and call for the wisdom of Solomon. [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=972.34s)]
*  Do you know what Solomon asked for? [[00:16:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=988.34s)]
*  He asked for an open heart. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=990.34s)]
*  He asked for wisdom and an open heart. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=992.34s)]
*  And the God said, We're really impressed. [[00:16:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=995.34s)]
*  I'm very impressed with that. [[00:16:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=998.34s)]
*  You didn't ask for power, for riches, for long life. [[00:16:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=999.34s)]
*  I prayed that those folks there would see with the wisdom of Solomon what this country needed, which was to disqualify this man, to hold him accountable, to hold him guilty for incitement of insurrection and disqualify him. [[00:16:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1003.34s)]
*  Look where we are now, because they would not do their duty. [[00:16:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1018.34s)]
*  Because they didn't have the wisdom. [[00:17:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1022.34s)]
*  They were instead praying for power. [[00:17:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1023.34s)]
*  And I don't know what else. [[00:17:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1026.3400000000001s)]
*  How do you think about all this? [[00:17:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1029.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I guess how how seriously do you take the threat? [[00:17:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1031.3400000000001s)]
*  I mean, I, you know, he's a front runner for the nomination. [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1034.3400000000001s)]
*  We're a polarized country. [[00:17:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1037.3400000000001s)]
*  If you win one of the major party nominations, you're, you know, within a coin flip, you know, you probably start with 40 percent of the vote. [[00:17:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1039.3400000000001s)]
*  It's extraordinarily frightening. [[00:17:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1048.34s)]
*  You see the polls that have President Biden and the former guy at a dead heat. [[00:17:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1053.34s)]
*  I believe that will shake out and become very, very different because the economy has moved in the right direction. [[00:17:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1059.34s)]
*  We have passed incredible resources that are going into American communities, into American homes and businesses. [[00:17:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1065.34s)]
*  So I think that will change. [[00:17:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1073.34s)]
*  But you are right to sound the alarm. [[00:17:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1075.34s)]
*  This is a very scary time. [[00:17:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1078.34s)]
*  If this man is gets the nomination, if somehow delays these trials, I have a feeling this judge in D.C. [[00:18:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1080.34s)]
*  is not going to be played with. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1088.34s)]
*  But if somehow he gets the nomination or somehow would win the election. [[00:18:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1090.34s)]
*  The threat to our democracy is so grave, I don't even want to talk about it. [[00:18:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1098.34s)]
*  You have raised some of those things. [[00:18:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1104.34s)]
*  He says it out loud. [[00:18:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1106.34s)]
*  You know, I was thinking of the his inaugural address. [[00:18:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1108.34s)]
*  Do you remember what he said? [[00:18:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1110.34s)]
*  The stunning line was this American carnage stops now. [[00:18:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1111.34s)]
*  Do you know what I heard when he said that? [[00:18:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1116.34s)]
*  This American carnage starts now. [[00:18:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1119.34s)]
*  He is in the midst of American carnage. [[00:18:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1122.34s)]
*  People have lost their lives. [[00:18:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1125.34s)]
*  And we have people like McCarthy and McConnell taking a back seat to all of this. [[00:18:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1127.34s)]
*  McCarthy entertaining the idea of resolutions to erase his impeachments as though they never happened. [[00:18:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1132.34s)]
*  Tell that to the officers who lost their lives, to their families who lost their lives, the officers who were so severely wounded, [[00:19:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1141.34s)]
*  to all of us who were in the Capitol terrorized, your colleagues who were terrorized, [[00:19:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1149.34s)]
*  that staffers who cleaned up the mess, you can't erase this part of history. [[00:19:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1154.34s)]
*  And we must not let this former president, this criminal former president who cares nothing for democracy, get back into office. [[00:19:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1159.34s)]
*  Congresswoman Madeline Dean of Pennsylvania, who was one of the impeachment managers in that very important [[00:19:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1167.34s)]
*  and I thought well presented second impeachment of the former guy. [[00:19:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1174.34s)]
*  Thank you very much. [[00:19:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1177.34s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:19:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ljg7DTOTLmw&t=1189.34s)]
