# ‘Horrific’: Joe Rogan blasts Trump for sending innocent people to El Salvador prison
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [April 01, 2025](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw)
*  You gotta get scared that people who are not criminals are getting like [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=0.0s)]
*  lassoed up and deported and sent to like [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=5.58s)]
*  El Salvador prisons. This is kind of crazy that that could be possible. That's horrific. And that's again [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=9.42s)]
*  That's bad for the cause like the cause is let's get the gang members out everybody agrees [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=16.18s)]
*  But what's not innocent gay hairdressers get lumped up with the gangs and then like how long? [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=20.04s)]
*  Before that guy can get out can we can we figure out how to get him out? [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=25.26s)]
*  Is there any plan in place to alert the authorities that they've made a horrible mistake? [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=28.94s)]
*  The guy that Joe Rogan is talking about is Andre Jose Hernandez Romero [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=34.02s)]
*  He is the gay Venezuelan makeup artist that was flown to a maximum security prison El Salvador for having crown tattoos [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=38.1s)]
*  Which is apparently for the Trump administration proof [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=45.7s)]
*  That he is in a gang [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=49.14s)]
*  This case is just one of many we have learned about where tattooed non gang members [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=50.86s)]
*  Have been uprooted and sent to El Salvador with zero due process and to Joe Rogan's point it is horrific [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=55.54s)]
*  And it was a horrible mistake [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=61.64s)]
*  Just like when they sent a father from Maryland with protected legal status to that same El Salvadorian prison [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=63.440000000000005s)]
*  That man's name is Gilmar Abrego Garcia now. He came to the US from El Salvador in 2011 [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=69.34s)]
*  He's a legal resident who has a 2019 court order that prevented him from being sent back to his home country [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=74.82000000000001s)]
*  The White House have provided no credible evidence that he's in a gang his lawyers denies he has any gang affiliation [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=82.06s)]
*  Yesterday the administration actually made it in court papers that quote on March 15th [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=89.42s)]
*  Although ICE was aware of his protection from removal to El Salvador [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=93.38s)]
*  Abrego Garcia was removed to El Salvador because of an administrative error [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=98.14s)]
*  Administrative error that took this man away from his home, Maryland where he lives with his wife and three children [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=102.86s)]
*  Including a five-year-old child who's an American citizen who is autistic and intellectually disabled [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=108.42s)]
*  Simon Sandoval motion Berg is the attorney representing that Maryland father kilmar Abrego Garcia and he joins me now [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=115.02s)]
*  It's good to have you on the program first. I want to just ask we've all seen these sort of [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=121.42s)]
*  Horrific images of this prison. We've read reporting about it [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=126.58s)]
*  How are you able to contact your client is there any avenue to even talk to him down there? [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=129.57999999999998s)]
*  No, unfortunately prisoners in the notorious CICOT prison are held in communicato. It really is a black hole [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=137.82s)]
*  So there's just is there any way to like talk to the El Salvadoran authorities? [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=145.5s)]
*  Is there any pathway or route when a mistake has been made as the government has now admitted? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=151.38s)]
*  For any kind of process to get people out of that place [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=157.98s)]
*  We believe that if the government of the United States made simply made a good-faith request to the government of El Salvador to give him back [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=163.42s)]
*  I [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=170.14s)]
*  Expect that that would be successful right now [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=171.54s)]
*  It appears that the government of El Salvador does pretty much anything we ask them to do we say jump they say how high [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=173.82s)]
*  Christie Noem was inside the walls of that prison on Wednesday of last week [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=179.57999999999998s)]
*  We filed this case on Monday of last week [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=184.29999999999998s)]
*  We had our first scheduling conference with the judge on Tuesday of last week [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=186.22s)]
*  So after the government was already on notice of this case it was already on notice that they made this mistake [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=190.02s)]
*  They sent Christie Noem into that prison, but she didn't make any steps to bring [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=195.06s)]
*  Mr. Abrigo Garcia back to the United States with her. That's what we're asking the judge to order [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=199.78s)]
*  There has I'm sure you've seen the vice president United States was a lot of time to tweet apparently like a lot of time [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=205.06s)]
*  Posting about your your client basically saying that he's an illegal immigrant [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=212.46s)]
*  He has no right to be in the country [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=216.78s)]
*  The he a judge immigration to judge determined he was a member of the MS 13 gang and he's not a citizen [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=218.78s)]
*  So he got the due process necessary. What is your response to that? [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=225.62s)]
*  My client was issued an order of protection by an immigration judge under the first Trump administration in 2019 [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=232.10000000000002s)]
*  The government chose not to appeal that decision [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=238.9s)]
*  Right. They they simply released him and let it be there's no way that they could have done that [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=241.42000000000002s)]
*  There's lots of legal steps if the government really thinks that they have the evidence that my client is a gang member [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=246.18s)]
*  Which he's absolutely not but if they think they have evidence that he is [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=251.46s)]
*  There are lots of legal proceedings that they can go through to try to legally strip him of his order of protection [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=254.57999999999998s)]
*  They didn't do any of that. They just put him on a plane and by doing so they've prevented the immigration courts from doing their job [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=259.94s)]
*  Correct me if I'm wrong, but he came to the US [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=267.86s)]
*  Seeking asylum at exactly the age that lots of folks have fled El Salvador and Nicaragua and Honduras [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=272.14s)]
*  Precisely because when boys of a certain age start to sort of age into essentially gang either recruitment or basically [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=279.26s)]
*  You know being drafted. He didn't want to be part of that and that was why he came to the United States [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=286.94s)]
*  That's right, he was 16 years old at the time he came he came fleeing [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=295.7s)]
*  Harassment bullying and attempts at forced recruitment from the very gangs that they're now accusing him of being a member of [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=300.22s)]
*  His family his five-year-old child is an American citizen. Is that correct? [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=307.94s)]
*  That's right his wife is an American citizen his five-year-old child [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=314.34000000000003s)]
*  Who is autistic is an American citizen and the child was present for his arrest earlier this month and was severely traumatized by it [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=318.5s)]
*  the family [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=326.82s)]
*  First of all, how are they doing? I mean, I imagine you're in contact with them [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=328.86s)]
*  They can't talk to their husband or father like how are they doing? [[00:05:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=332.94s)]
*  No, it's very stressful. She was in communication with mr. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=337.34s)]
*  Obrego Garcia while he was in ICE detention [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=341.65999999999997s)]
*  They were bouncing him around from detention center to detention center [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=343.94s)]
*  And then all of a sudden one day just stopped calling and she didn't know what happened until a friend pointed out [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=346.76s)]
*  pictures of the [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=352.21999999999997s)]
*  Venezuelans who'd been deported to El Salvador and she recognized him in the media coverage from some scars on his head [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=353.42s)]
*  and a [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=358.86s)]
*  Tattoo of a lion that he has on his arm final question for you your your your your demand for the government to redress the error [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=360.02s)]
*  They themselves admit is for them to make a request to the government to get him out of that prison and bring him back [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=367.7s)]
*  Is that correct? [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=375.3s)]
*  Step one is just ask nicely ask bukele ask the government of El Salvador to give him back to us [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=377.96s)]
*  Again I expect that's gonna work if it doesn't work then we can look at other remedial steps that are necessary [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=384.42s)]
*  All right, Simon Sandoval motion Burke who represents that man who is in that prison [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=389.58s)]
*  Due to error by the admission of the Trump administration. Thanks for joining us and I appreciate it [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=395.02s)]
*  My pleasure [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=400.65999999999997s)]
*  You [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VvedT5oDhw&t=413.82s)]
