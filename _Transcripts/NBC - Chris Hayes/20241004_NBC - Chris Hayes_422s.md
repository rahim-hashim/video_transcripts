# ‘Smoking gun’: Trump refused disaster relief until he learned it helped GOP voters, ex-aides say
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 04, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY)
*  So Donald Trump is resorting to conspiracy theories and lies to blast the Biden administration's [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=0.0s)]
*  handling of the Hurricane Helene disaster. [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=4.8s)]
*  This week, we're learning from new bombshell reporting that this accusation was basically [[00:00:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=7.640000000000001s)]
*  a confession of an absolutely egregious act Trump took when he was president. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=12.44s)]
*  Two former Trump administration officials now tell Politico's E&E News that as president, [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=18.080000000000002s)]
*  Trump repeatedly hesitated to give disaster aid to areas he considered politically hostile [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=24.240000000000002s)]
*  or ordered special treatment for pro-Trump states. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=29.64s)]
*  One of those sources, former National Security Council official Mark Harvey, said that Trump [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=33.160000000000004s)]
*  initially refused to approve disaster aid for California after deadly wildfires in 2018 [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=37.88s)]
*  because of the state's democratic leanings. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=44.44s)]
*  But Harvey said Trump changed his mind after Harvey pulled voting results to show him that [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=47.44s)]
*  heavily damaged Orange County, California had more Trump supporters than the entire [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=53.519999999999996s)]
*  state of Iowa. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=57.88s)]
*  Quote, we went as far as looking up how many votes he got in those impacted areas to show [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=58.96s)]
*  him these are people who voted for you, Harvey said. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=64.76s)]
*  Harvey, who's since endorsed Kamala Harris for president, later said of Trump, there's [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=68.0s)]
*  no empathy for the survivors. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=72.0s)]
*  It's all about getting your photo up, right? [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=73.52000000000001s)]
*  Disaster theater to make them look good. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=76.04s)]
*  At some level, you probably suspected this all along, but this is a genuine smoking gun. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=77.52000000000001s)]
*  People that worked for Trump speaking openly on the record about what ought to be an impeachment [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=83.02000000000001s)]
*  an American president refusing to sign off on disaster aid to people he thought weren't [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=88.48s)]
*  sufficiently supportive of his political ambitions. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=93.36s)]
*  Trump did exactly what he's falsely accusing the current president of doing. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=97.12s)]
*  It's also a reminder of part of what was so upsetting about Trump's tenure, remember, [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=100.96000000000001s)]
*  four years ago, bungling the country's response to its first dangerous pandemic in a hundred [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=104.52000000000001s)]
*  years, watching him lie and brag and blame his through way through interminable daily [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=109.08000000000001s)]
*  press conferences. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=113.96000000000001s)]
*  It was crystal clear the political consequences were all he cared about with COVID. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=115.52s)]
*  He did not give one damn about whether people got sick or died or how many. [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=120.8s)]
*  He cared about his reelection, his political fortunes. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=124.84s)]
*  He told his vice president, Mike Pence, not to call desperate governors who he deemed [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=127.72s)]
*  insufficiently grateful. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=131.68s)]
*  He mused about cutting eight to blue states. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=133.06s)]
*  He talked about limiting testing for COVID, because more testing would show more sickness [[00:02:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=135.12s)]
*  and that will look bad for him. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=140.24s)]
*  Now we've got this smoking gun evidence of him basically saying, I'm not going to get [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=142.92s)]
*  disaster relief to California because they don't have enough Republicans there. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=146.39999999999998s)]
*  That's the Trump model of governance, extreme and thankfully rare. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=151.23999999999998s)]
*  I don't think there's anyone who governs like that. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=154.35999999999999s)]
*  For a different model of governance, look how President Joe Biden and Vice President [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=156.23999999999998s)]
*  Kamala Harris have handled the recent longshoreman strike, a strike over wages and mechanization [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=160.07999999999998s)]
*  that threatened to bring trade at many of America's ports and the East Coast to a halt, [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=166.17999999999998s)]
*  which could have and would have likely have driven up supply shortages and consumer costs, [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=171.12s)]
*  spiking inflation a month before the presidential election. [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=175.64000000000001s)]
*  Now a politically safe thing I think for the Biden administration to do would have been [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=179.44s)]
*  to just intervene, halt the strike, pause it, order union members back to work. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=183.16000000000003s)]
*  And that's a power that's given to the president under the Anti-Union Taft-Hartley Act of 1947. [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=187.66000000000003s)]
*  Previous presidents, including Richard Nixon, George W. Bush, have invoked it to stop port strikes. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=193.20000000000002s)]
*  But Biden thought that would be selling out the workers and their bargaining for a new contract. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=198.48s)]
*  Harris also came out in support of the union dock workers, saying it was about fairness [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=215.79999999999998s)]
*  and that she backed the strike and that support from the president and vice president strengthened [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=219.76s)]
*  the union's position. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=223.35999999999999s)]
*  And after two days, the union suspended the strike to continue negotiations on a new contract. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=225.0s)]
*  Conservatives at Fox News, who were rooting for a costly strike that could impact millions [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=230.32s)]
*  of Americans heading into the election, sounded pretty disappointed. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=233.64s)]
*  I've got to prepare all of you to get very angry because what we're about to share with [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=239.16s)]
*  you will rightly make your blood boil. [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=243.2s)]
*  As most of you know, ports, by the way, along the East Coast were shut down this week because [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=246.16s)]
*  of a union leader's demands. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=250.56s)]
*  We have the update on that and including a reported 75 percent pay raise for dock workers. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=253.36s)]
*  I think now the employers are up to 62 percent. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=259.72s)]
*  Anyway, a lot of them make six figures. [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=263.44s)]
*  Kamala Harris supported this shutdown, which cost you, the American people, is costing [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=265.92s)]
*  us billions of dollars a day. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=270.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, the longshoremen strike may be temporarily suspended until mid-January. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=272.44s)]
*  And although Kamala Harris, of course, breathing a sigh of relief tonight, American voters [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=277.04s)]
*  shouldn't. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=281.56s)]
*  Everything's politics, right? [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=283.68s)]
*  How does it benefit Trump? [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=284.68s)]
*  Right now, there wasn't a particularly clear political benefit to Biden and Harris supporting [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=285.76s)]
*  the strike. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=290.44s)]
*  The Longshoremen's Union, for instance, which endorsed Biden in 2020, hasn't made an endorsement [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=291.44s)]
*  this year. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=295.84000000000003s)]
*  And I'm not sure Harris is going to win a majority of those members. [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=296.84000000000003s)]
*  And labor is a core Democratic constituency. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=301.08000000000004s)]
*  But it's also clear that despite the Biden-Harris administration's strongly pro-labor record, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=303.04s)]
*  union voters in most polls support has hit an all time low for the Democratic ticket. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=308.1s)]
*  So this wasn't really transactional politics as much as I think it was just genuinely [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=313.32s)]
*  principled. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=317.76s)]
*  That the right thing to do in the moment was to side with labor. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=318.76s)]
*  That's what they believed. [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=321.24s)]
*  And that's not to say Biden and Harris and other politicians across both parties don't [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=322.24s)]
*  have political agendas as well. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=326.12s)]
*  Of course, they're traditional politicians in that sense. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=327.64s)]
*  For all their ideological commitments and relationships, though, they do have some sense [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=330.88s)]
*  of the public interest, like what is right? [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=335.32s)]
*  What is best for most Americans? [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=337.15999999999997s)]
*  They just don't approach every single last decision by first thinking, what will get [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=339.04s)]
*  me elected? [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=344.32s)]
*  What will give me more power? [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=345.42s)]
*  But that is how Donald Trump thinks. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=347.28000000000003s)]
*  He's a man who changed a hurricane path with a Sharpie because he'd been ridiculed for [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=349.40000000000003s)]
*  misstating where the storm was headed. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=354.16s)]
*  Who autographed a stock chart to take credit for every bump in market value in the middle [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=356.96000000000004s)]
*  of COVID. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=362.12s)]
*  He is incapable of thinking about others except in the most instrumental exploitive ways. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=363.12s)]
*  We lived through one of the worst examples and it was so traumatic, we basically blocked [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=368.4s)]
*  it out. [[00:06:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=372.12s)]
*  Now we've learned that he really does see aid as something that only his people deserve. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=373.64s)]
*  It is possible to expect something more out of our presidents than a constant transactional [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=379.15999999999997s)]
*  obsession with their status. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=384.59999999999997s)]
*  You don't have to love Joe Biden and Kamala Harris to see that they really have an idea [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=386.44s)]
*  of what it means to work for the public interest. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=390.12s)]
*  But you have to be blind to pretend Donald Trump has any interest in anything other than [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=393.12s)]
*  his own weird and broken ego. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zflI8x4dgGY&t=398.56s)]
