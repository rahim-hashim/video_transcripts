# Watch All In with Chris Hayes Highlights: May 5
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4)
*  There is an almost incomprehensibly beautiful painting that we have been showing you over the past few weeks. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=0.0s)]
*  It's been the center of all the stories about the relationship between Republican mega donor Harlan Crow and Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=5.0s)]
*  To me, this stunning image captures the real story. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=12.0s)]
*  Not only are Thomas and Crow pictured here at Crow's luxurious Adirondack Resort, where this painting hangs, [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=16.0s)]
*  we also see Federalist Society co-chairman Leonard Leo, who the Washington Post reports directed tens of thousands of dollars of business to the firm of Ginny Thomas, [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=23.0s)]
*  at least that we know of, while keeping her name off billing paperwork, though NBC News has not independently verified that report. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=32.0s)]
*  And then there's Mark Paoletta. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=39.0s)]
*  He's the former general counsel for the Office of Management and Budget under Donald Trump and the lawyer for Ginny Thomas. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=41.0s)]
*  He's also been writing defenses of this whole arrangement. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=46.0s)]
*  That's Peter Rutledge, dean of the University of Georgia Law School. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=49.0s)]
*  Now, the story of chumminess and, I'd argue, corruption told in this image is not tangential to the story of our current 6-3 conservative supermajority in the court [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=52.0s)]
*  and the Dobbs decision that struck down Roe v. Wade and many other dangerous decisions that have already been issued and will be issued by this court. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=63.0s)]
*  It is all one story. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=71.0s)]
*  To understand that story, you got to start by viewing it from the perspective of some of the men in that photo, like Leonard Leo, conservatives like Leonard Leo. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=72.0s)]
*  He's one of the most powerful people in conservative legal circles in this country. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=81.0s)]
*  In fact, the most powerful. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=84.0s)]
*  He's the architect of this court. [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=85.0s)]
*  And from Leo's perspective, here's how the last 50 years played out. [[00:01:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=87.0s)]
*  All right. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=91.0s)]
*  Listen to this. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=92.0s)]
*  Since the 1970s, the court has had majorities of justice that were appointed by Republican presidents. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=93.0s)]
*  The whole time, there was never a majority appointed by Democratic nominees. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=99.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=104.0s)]
*  Yet despite this, the court refused to move as far to the right as activists like Leo and hardliners wanted it to. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=105.0s)]
*  In some cases, quite famously, Republican appointed justices became bedrock stalwart liberals like the great Justice John Paul Stevens, to a somewhat lesser extent, David Souter. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=111.0s)]
*  Then in other cases, Republican appointees moved back and forth, but drifted to the middle on really key issues like abortion and gay rights, justices Sandra Day O'Connor and Anthony Kennedy. [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=123.0s)]
*  I mean, when Planned Parenthood v. Casey came to the court in 1992, those two justices, Kennedy O'Connor, both appointed by Reagan, ruled to uphold the protections in row. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=133.0s)]
*  And all of this was, to men like Leo and his cohort, an unfathomable betrayal and an outrage. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=142.0s)]
*  And, you know, it's not crazy they felt that way. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=148.0s)]
*  I mean, think about how it would feel if last June in the Dobbs decision, Justice Sonia Sotomayor had joined the majority in striking down abortion rights. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=151.0s)]
*  Liberals would have lost their minds. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=160.0s)]
*  And that's what it felt like for a lot of Republicans. [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=162.0s)]
*  So that was the problem they had, right? [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=165.0s)]
*  Justice after justice, being appointed by Republican nominees and then not voting the way they wanted to. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=167.0s)]
*  They would put people on the court, but then they couldn't control how they ruled. [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=172.0s)]
*  And what good was the power of getting justices on the bench if they just went liberal on you? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=176.0s)]
*  Now, I think they came to understand that they had a problem to solve. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=181.0s)]
*  And there were two sort of components of that problem. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=186.0s)]
*  The first was they weren't vetting their conservative justices enough to ensure that they were only selecting the most dyed-in-the-wool true believers. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=188.0s)]
*  And then secondly, once they were on the court, they were losing them to other influences. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=196.0s)]
*  They seemed to drift away from their previous hard-right positions. [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=203.0s)]
*  Now, it is my personal opinion this was likely the result of the realities of judging, not to mention the insufficiencies of right-wing legal dogma. [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=206.0s)]
*  For someone like Leo, he had to come up with a solution. [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=214.0s)]
*  They all did. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=218.0s)]
*  And I think he came up with a twofold solution. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=219.0s)]
*  You can see it in his actions. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=221.0s)]
*  First, make sure there is a mechanism for vetting true believers. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=222.0s)]
*  And I mean early on, a farm system from all the way down. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=226.0s)]
*  He is the co-chairman of the Federal Society, which cultivates, nurtures, selects young people starting in their first year of law school, in the first week of law school, [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=229.0s)]
*  and then nurtures them through law school and then to clerkships and then jobs in politics and helping them become Supreme Court clerks, [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=239.0s)]
*  which is the most important job for a young conservative or any young lawyer, and then nominees for being judges themselves. [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=246.0s)]
*  And once they are positioned properly, right, then this is the second part of the solution. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=253.0s)]
*  You've got to make sure that you keep them contained in this world so they do not drift away from right-wing beliefs. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=257.0s)]
*  Well, how do you achieve that? [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=267.0s)]
*  Well, you create a whole universe of conservative think tanks and get-togethers and conferences and donor relationships to surround these justices, [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=268.0s)]
*  like, I don't know, a summer retreat at Harlan Crowe's Resort where they enjoy luxury accommodations, fresh air, and some cigars with right-wing ideologues. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=275.0s)]
*  I know this sounds a little conspiratorial, but here's a description given to the New York Times by one of the few people who was part of this overall effort who then subsequently left it. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=283.0s)]
*  I'll quote him here. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=295.0s)]
*  Quote, [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=296.0s)]
*  See, the thing is, Leo, and I think other conservatives, have a mental model in which liberalism is this kind of conspiratorial indoctrination, [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=326.0s)]
*  hatched in back rooms to brainwash people as opposed to what I think it is, a complicated, emergent cultural phenomenon of an open society. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=340.0s)]
*  But conservatives take that false model of, like, men with literally cigars sitting around a table deciding how to control cultural institutions, and then they explicitly adopt it as their own. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=349.0s)]
*  Again, don't take my word for it. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=359.0s)]
*  Listen to a video of Leonard Lihill himself, who's now raised billions from right-wing billionaires, talking about his plans to use the strategy he helped for the court to spread conservatism to other parts of society as part of a private organization Leo co-chairs called Teneo. [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=361.0s)]
*  I spent close to 30 years, if not more, helping to build the conservative legal movement. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=376.0s)]
*  And at some point or another, you know, I just said to myself, well, if this can work for law, why can't it work for lots of other areas of American culture and American life where things are really messed up right now? [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=384.0s)]
*  Woke is in the corporate environment, in the educational environment, one-sided journalism, entertainment that's really corrupting our youth. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=399.0s)]
*  Why can't we build talent pipelines and networks that can positively affect those areas as well? [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=407.0s)]
*  Talent pipelines and networks. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=414.0s)]
*  What do you think Harlan Crowe and Leonard Leo and their conservative buddies talk about with the justice and the Supreme Court clearance Thomas Wolin hangout? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=416.0s)]
*  After Crowe has taken Thomas on a trip on his private jet or bought the house Thomas' mother was living in or paid private school tuition for the child Thomas was raising? [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=424.0s)]
*  What do you think they talk about? [[00:07:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=433.0s)]
*  Who are we kidding here? [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=435.0s)]
*  What about the Washington Post report, which NBC has not verified about Leonard Leo directing business fees to Ginny Thomas? [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=438.0s)]
*  Do you think the Thomas family simply had no idea where that money was coming from? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=444.0s)]
*  This is fundamentally what the conservative session has been about. [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=449.0s)]
*  It explains, among other things, why this court, the 6-3 Dobbs Court, is in such a rush to overturn precedent as fast as they can. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=453.0s)]
*  The first chance they got in this new conservative court, they overturned Roe. [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=461.0s)]
*  And it's not hard to imagine that part of that rush stems from the desire to execute this judicial revolution before any of the justices potentially change their mind or drift as previous justices have. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=465.0s)]
*  What we have now embodied in that image is the kind of captured court that Leonard Leo has worked towards for years. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=477.0s)]
*  You can see it all laid bare right there in a single picture. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=486.0s)]
*  In Donald Trump's civil rape trial, the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape where he grabs about assaulting women was shown as an exhibit to the jury yesterday. [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=495.0s)]
*  Not only did the jury watch the video itself, they got to watch Trump during the October deposition watching the infamous video in real time. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=504.0s)]
*  I took her out for an insh- I moved in her like a b- I couldn't get there and she was married. [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=534.0s)]
*  I'm automatically attracted to beautiful- I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. I don't even know what- and when you're starved, they let you do it. You can do anything. [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=539.0s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:09:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=548.0s)]
*  Grab them by the b- I can do anything. [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=549.0s)]
*  Eugene Carroll's attorney then asked Trump about those comments and he basically admitted to doing exactly what he said. He really did. [[00:09:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=553.0s)]
*  And you did say in the video that you quote, moved on her heavily, correct? [[00:09:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=561.0s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:09:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=565.0s)]
*  You do say in the video that you quote, moved on her heavily. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=566.0s)]
*  I did say that, yes, absolutely. [[00:09:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=569.0s)]
*  And you do say in the video that as part of trying to have sex with this woman, you took her furniture shopping, correct? [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=571.0s)]
*  We actually did look for furniture, yes. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=578.0s)]
*  So that was true. You actually took this woman and- [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=582.0s)]
*  I think so. I've been spent a long time ago. How long is it? Long time ago. But I think so. I do think so. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=586.0s)]
*  Is that the only occasion when you took a woman shopping? [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=594.0s)]
*  I think so. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=597.0s)]
*  And you say, and again this has become very famous in this video, I just start kissing them. It's like a magnet. Just kiss. I don't even wait. [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=598.0s)]
*  And when you're starved, they let you do it. You can do anything. Grab them by the b- You can do anything. That's what you said, correct? [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=607.0s)]
*  Well, historically that's true with stars. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=615.0s)]
*  It's true with stars that they can grab women by the b- [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=617.0s)]
*  Well, that's what- if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely true. Not always, but largely true. Unfortunately or fortunately. [[00:10:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=620.0s)]
*  And you consider yourself to be a star? [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=631.0s)]
*  I think you can say that, yes. [[00:10:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=634.0s)]
*  Unfortunately or fortunately. MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin was in the courtroom when the jury saw all that and she joins me now. [[00:10:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=638.0s)]
*  What a strange sort of inception moment. They're watching- they're in the jury room watching a deposition in which he's small screened while they play the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:10:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=647.0s)]
*  Just what was that like in the room during the 45 minutes of deposition excerpts they got to see? [[00:10:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=657.0s)]
*  Bizarre. And you can see him sort of trying to think on his feet too because initially in a portion that you guys didn't show, he's saying, oh, this has been litigated already. [[00:11:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=663.0s)]
*  That's locker room talk, locker room talk. I think I said that in a debate. [[00:11:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=673.0s)]
*  And then he is confronted with the tape itself and his words. And then he owns them, right? [[00:11:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=677.0s)]
*  Historically, that's been true, fortunately or unfortunately. [[00:11:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=684.0s)]
*  And then he says, she says, oh, that's true. You can, stars can do that. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=688.0s)]
*  And his response is breathtaking, right? For a million years. I didn't know that the Hollywood studio system was a million years old. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=693.0s)]
*  But for a million years and you consider yourself a star, I think it's fair to say that. [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=702.0s)]
*  That is essentially going from minimizing the statement entirely from locker room talk to I'm going to own this and be, I don't know, an expert on history of how the story goes. [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=707.0s)]
*  Of how the star system has evolved in this country. It's also the ideology of sexual predation. [[00:11:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=717.0s)]
*  I mean, it's the belief system of dominance and predation, which is basically if you have a certain status, that doesn't matter, which is what it's articulated in the video and what he reaffirms as his binding belief there, which is also why that she's not my type. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=722.0s)]
*  So to go back to your point, right? If sexual assault is fundamentally about predation and control and dominance and violence, whether or not you're someone's physical type really doesn't have anything to do with it at all. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=737.0s)]
*  Well, and it's also, I mean, I want to play a little bit of his insults just during the deposition because this is what he, you know, this is just what he does. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=750.0s)]
*  He's a person who is wildly insecure, is sort of driven above all things by his insecurity and that insecurity turns into this sort of like lashing out insults. [[00:12:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=756.0s)]
*  And this is him just sort of his various insults that were played during the deposition. Take a look. [[00:12:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=767.0s)]
*  I still don't know this woman. I think she's a whack job, but I know nothing about her. I think she's sick, mentally sick. [[00:12:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=774.0s)]
*  You wouldn't be a choice of mine either, to be honest with you. I hope you're not insulted. I would not under any circumstances have any interest in you. [[00:13:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=782.0s)]
*  I'm being honest when I say it. [[00:13:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=790.0s)]
*  This is Robbie Kaplan, one of the sort of most celebrated litigators and out gay women in the American bar. [[00:13:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=793.0s)]
*  But it just seems to me that like, I don't know. I just don't know how that like truculence and insolence and then just sort of owning it reads to the jury. [[00:13:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=801.0s)]
*  I mean, there's no way to know. There really isn't any way to know. I will say that the courtroom was really silent during the playing of this deposition. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=811.0s)]
*  And even though there were people like me in the courtroom who have read excerpts of this, right, we have seen excerpts of this deposition before they were released as part of the filings in this case in January. [[00:13:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=819.0s)]
*  I think I actually was here with you, Chris, and we talked about them when they were first released. [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=828.0s)]
*  Despite that, seeing him own them, saying them, his body language was really wild. And you could hear a pin drop in that courtroom. [[00:13:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=831.0s)]
*  So on Monday, we have closing arguments. There was a little bit. I want to this. This is a back and forth from yesterday. [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=841.0s)]
*  And I think this is about this, you know, Trump boasting that he's going to come back, right? Which he's not going to do. I mean, eat my hat if he does. [[00:14:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=847.0s)]
*  This is a talk of Pina. I'm going to rest. I'm telling you right now I'm going to rest. Judge, I understand. [[00:14:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=856.0s)]
*  Talk of Pina. OK, Judge. And that might well prove to be the case, but I will wait and see. [[00:14:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=860.0s)]
*  Talk of Pina then, Judge. And I'm not implying dishonesty on your part, meaning that when you say your rest, talk of Pina says, No, I know you're not. [[00:14:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=864.0s)]
*  I know you're not. I know you're not. I know you understand what I'm dealing with. [[00:14:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=872.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=876.0s)]
*  To a person, everyone who ever has worked with him at some point is in this position of being like you understand. [[00:14:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=877.0s)]
*  Yes. And there was a moment, you know, the part that you just read happened outside the earshot, not only of the jury, but of all of the observers in the courtroom. [[00:14:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=886.0s)]
*  It was published in the transcript that we got today. But when they came out from that conversation, they sort of rehashed that conversation publicly in front of everyone. [[00:14:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=895.0s)]
*  I noticed Judge Kaplan was very gentle towards Joe Talk of Pina and basically said the same thing publicly. [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=903.0s)]
*  I'm not implying that you are being dishonest, Mr. Talk of Pina, with the court. There seemed to be a sort of simpatico between them. [[00:15:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=908.0s)]
*  I understand the difficult position you're in. Donald Trump does this, as you said, to each and every one of his lawyers. [[00:15:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=914.0s)]
*  Closing argument is money. Just final thought here. I mean, there is a reason, right? [[00:15:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=922.0s)]
*  The majority of sexual assaults are not reported. Those that are reported very few go to trial. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=926.0s)]
*  When they do go to trial, it can be very hard to secure a conviction. This is decades after the incident. [[00:15:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=931.0s)]
*  It's in a civil trial. So there's a different standard of evidence, preponderance of the evidence as opposed to beyond reasonable doubt. [[00:15:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=936.0s)]
*  And yet, for all the reasons that it is difficult to secure justice in a courtroom under laws of evidence of a sexual assault, it doesn't strike me that this is necessarily a slam dunk. [[00:15:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=941.0s)]
*  It's not necessarily a slam dunk for a lot of the reasons that you just recalled. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=952.0s)]
*  And I think that's less to do with whether she screamed or whether she reported to the fact that she can't pinpoint certain details. [[00:15:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=955.0s)]
*  And they were able to chip away at her case. One of the things that you and I talked about on a break is that at one point somebody sent an email to E.J. Carroll saying, [[00:16:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=962.0s)]
*  Hey, are you aware of the fact that there's a law and order episode that's largely about the same constellation of facts that you say is what happened to you in Verdorf Goodman? [[00:16:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=972.0s)]
*  If the jury is entitled to rely on that, that could be hugely damaging because it's essentially a vehicle for talk of penises suggest you made this all up after seeing it on TV. [[00:16:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=981.0s)]
*  And so I do think that there are things for the jury to hang their hat on here, namely the corroboration from the two people she told in real time and the other two accusers, particularly Natasha Stoynov, [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=990.0s)]
*  who was one of the most credible witnesses I've ever seen in a courtroom. But at the same time, we still live in a society where victims don't report for a reason. [[00:16:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=1000.0s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, thank you so much for joining us. Have a great weekend. [[00:16:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sUXdFjBPwz4&t=1010.0s)]
