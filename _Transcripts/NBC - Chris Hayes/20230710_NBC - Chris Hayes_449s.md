# NYT Clarence Thomas gave elite group 'unusual' access to Supreme Court
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 10, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s)
*  Ultra-conservative Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas is no stranger to scandal. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=0.0s)]
*  Last year, in the midst of the January 6 Committee's investigation, we learned that his wife, Ginny, [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=5.84s)]
*  exchanged dozens of text messages with Trump's chief of staff in her attempts to overturn [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=10.92s)]
*  the 2020 election. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=15.56s)]
*  Despite the obvious conflict of interest, Clarence Thomas refused to recuse himself [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=17.32s)]
*  from cases relating to the election or to January 6. [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=21.48s)]
*  This year, ProPublica broke a series of reports exposing an undisclosed relationship the [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=25.74s)]
*  justice maintained with a billionaire Republican donor named Harlan Crowe. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=30.459999999999997s)]
*  Crowe took Thomas on several all-expenses paid luxurious vacations worth hundreds of [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=35.22s)]
*  thousands of dollars. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=40.82s)]
*  He paid for his grandnephew's private school tuition as well. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=42.5s)]
*  He even purchased the justices' mother's home. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=45.379999999999995s)]
*  Justice Thomas did not disclose any of those lavish gifts. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=49.32s)]
*  The Washington Post recently reported that Federalist Society co-chairman Leonard Leo [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=53.82s)]
*  directed tens of thousands of dollars of business to the firm of Thomas' wife Ginny while keeping [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=57.74s)]
*  her name off the billing paperwork. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=63.78s)]
*  And now, the New York Times has just published the latest story of Thomas' association with [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=66.64s)]
*  an exclusive organization called the Horatio Alger Association, where Clarence Thomas, [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=72.18s)]
*  moved into the inner circle, a cluster of extraordinarily wealthy, largely conservative [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=79.25999999999999s)]
*  members who lionized him and all that he had achieved. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=84.53999999999999s)]
*  He has granted it unusual access to the Supreme Court, where every year he presides over the [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=89.14s)]
*  group's signature event, a ceremony in the courtroom at which he places Horatio Alger [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=94.22s)]
*  medals around the necks of new lifetime members. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=99.25999999999999s)]
*  One entrepreneur called it the closest thing to being knighted in the United States. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=102.98s)]
*  His friendships forged through Horatio Alger have brought him proximity to a lifestyle [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=109.26s)]
*  of unimaginable material privilege. [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=113.98s)]
*  Over the years, his Horatio Alger friends have welcomed him at their vacation retreats, [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=117.10000000000001s)]
*  arranged VIP access to sporting events, and invited him to their lavish parties. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=121.66s)]
*  Joining me now is one of the reporters who broke the story, Steve Eder, investigative [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=127.82000000000001s)]
*  reporter for the New York Times. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=131.68s)]
*  Steve, this is another blockbuster piece about Clarence Thomas. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=134.0s)]
*  And in it, it's pretty fair to say Clarence Thomas' relationship with this organization [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=138.76000000000002s)]
*  is a significant and meaningful one. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=143.28s)]
*  How specifically has Thomas benefited from the connections and the friendships he's forged [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=145.8s)]
*  with not only fellow members, but also with other Horatio Alger friends? [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=150.52s)]
*  Yeah, well, thanks for having me. [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=155.32s)]
*  Yeah, it's an important piece, I think, to look at this aspect of Justice Thomas' career. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=158.56s)]
*  I think when you look at the Horatio Alger Association, it is this group. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=165.24s)]
*  It kind of does two things. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=169.32s)]
*  There's a scholarship aspect to it that involves kids and giving away money. [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=170.32s)]
*  But there's also a network there of powerful, of wealthy people. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=174.68s)]
*  And Clarence Thomas, for a long time, has been very much at the center of this organization [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=179.44s)]
*  in certain ways and befriended people who are in and around this organization, kind [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=184.32s)]
*  of at the core of it. [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=189.51999999999998s)]
*  And that has led to various benefits for him as parts of these friendships. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=190.88s)]
*  There's trips to Florida, there's ranch visits in Montana, lavish birthday parties, access [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=195.88s)]
*  to sporting events, and things of that nature that you see when you start to trace through [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=201.28s)]
*  these relationships. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=204.64s)]
*  Steve, I mean, let's be frank. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=205.64s)]
*  Who wouldn't want to rub elbows with Oprah Winfrey and Denzel Washington? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=208.35999999999999s)]
*  Before tonight's show, I actually went to the membership directory for the Horatio Alger [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=213.2s)]
*  Organization because, look, it's not just super conservative people and Republicans. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=216.6s)]
*  I mean, it's everybody, right, that really meets the requirements to join this organization. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=220.95999999999998s)]
*  But let me be clear. [[00:03:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=226.6s)]
*  There are times of industry in this organization, from aerospace to tech to energy and electronics. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=227.6s)]
*  I mean, it's inevitable that cases involving these areas might end up before SCOTUS. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=232.6s)]
*  But Steve, can you really place something, if it seems to be nothing more than just a [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=237.6s)]
*  club or organization membership? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=242.4s)]
*  Yeah, and I think that's one of the issues here, is it relates to disclosure and what's [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=244.4s)]
*  disclosed and what's not disclosed. [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=249.52s)]
*  And that's been a big theme in the ethics discussion around the Supreme Court. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=250.96s)]
*  And one of the reasons that this caught our eye are the types of relationships, the business [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=255.36s)]
*  relationships, the range of industries that come into play here. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=259.24s)]
*  And so it comes down to, in some ways, a disclosure question and a transparency issue. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=262.84000000000003s)]
*  And what actually is disclosed? [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=269.48s)]
*  And in a lot of these cases, many of the cases that we noted, it wasn't disclosed. [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=272.12s)]
*  You report that Justice Thomas received benefits, quote, from a broader cohort of wealthy and [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=278.28s)]
*  powerful friends. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=283.4s)]
*  They've included major donors to conservative causes with broad policy and political interests [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=284.47999999999996s)]
*  and much at stake in Supreme Court decisions, even if they were not directly involved in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=289.47999999999996s)]
*  the cases. [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=295.0s)]
*  Is there any way, Steve, to be able to quantify the types of benefits that Clarence Thomas [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=296.0s)]
*  has received over the years? [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=301.48s)]
*  Well, based on the disclosures alone that he makes, which are required annual disclosures [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=304.84000000000003s)]
*  that federal judges make, there's what's disclosed. [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=309.8s)]
*  You often see you'll see teaching, you'll see speeches, you'll see things of that nature. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=313.20000000000005s)]
*  I think we're running into here is these other kinds of benefits and hospitality that [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=318.04s)]
*  comes into play, which is very hard to add up. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=324.6s)]
*  And through some of the reporting, our reporting, other reporting, we've begun to be able to [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=327.20000000000005s)]
*  piece together some of the other aspects of this. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=331.44s)]
*  You know, Steve, what really strikes me about this is you kind of can't begrudge somebody [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=334.8s)]
*  for being able to have what is this, you know, special tickets to suites for the Cowboys. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=339.32s)]
*  I mean, he's friends with Jerry Jones, who's a member of the organization. [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=345.68s)]
*  He's also he was friends with Wayne Heisinger, who was a Dolphins fan. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=348.48s)]
*  I mean, let's put aside the fact that Clarence Thomas says he's a Cowboys and a Dolphins fan [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=351.36s)]
*  at the same time, which kind of blows my mind in of itself. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=356.96s)]
*  I mean, you can't begrudge somebody from being able to rub elbows and to be able to be a [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=359.32s)]
*  part of this particular rarefied air. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=362.36s)]
*  But in and of itself, the fact that he has access to bend ears, but vice versa, that [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=364.96000000000004s)]
*  these people have the ability to bend his ear. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=371.28000000000003s)]
*  That's truly the issue here. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=374.88s)]
*  So do you think it comes to the point where we've talked about reforms, we've talked about [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=376.44s)]
*  SCOTUS, we've talked about making it better, tighter and more ethical. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=380.64s)]
*  Do you think that's exactly why this type of piece you've written is necessary for the [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=384.68s)]
*  American public to know? [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=388.64s)]
*  Well, I think it's about transparency and disclosure, and that's kind of at the root of [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=390.64s)]
*  just sort of what we're doing as journalists. [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=394.47999999999996s)]
*  But this is a case, too, where one of our big takeaways is looking at the access that [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=397.08s)]
*  Justice Thomas gave this organization, not just to the Supreme Court, but to the courtroom [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=402.28s)]
*  itself to hold their annual inauguration of these members, this very solemn ceremony [[00:06:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=406.47999999999996s)]
*  that's kind of at the heart of this. So there's a lot that goes into this and a lot to [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=411.88s)]
*  consider to think about the different ramifications and disclosures and transparency around it. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=415.88s)]
*  Steve Eder, I appreciate you being here and for giving us this blockbuster reporting. [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=422.2s)]
*  It's really good. Thanks for being here. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=425.68s)]
*  Thanks for having me. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4TYT9MDr16s&t=427.84s)]
