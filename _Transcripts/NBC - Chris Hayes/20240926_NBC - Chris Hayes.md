# MAGA rep doubles down after deleting 'shockingly' racist tweet ‘It’s all true’
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [September 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo)
*  Louisiana's third congressional district is home to over 770,000 people. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=0.0s)]
*  It's comprised of a geographically large portion of the southern half of the state, [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=4.5600000000000005s)]
*  including the city of Lafayette. [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=8.56s)]
*  The folks who live there have sent this man, Republican Clay Higgins, to be their representative [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  in the United States Congress four terms in a row. [[00:00:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=16.04s)]
*  Before he was a congressman, he was a Louisiana police deputy who got himself in a bit of [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=19.64s)]
*  trouble with the following video. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=23.740000000000002s)]
*  The Cleveland Street Gang is responsible for hundreds of violent crimes. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=26.8s)]
*  We've arrested ten of these thugs and have warrants on seven more. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=31.0s)]
*  Every one of these animals is most definitely armed and dangerous. [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=35.36s)]
*  You will be hunted. [[00:00:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=39.1s)]
*  You will be tracked. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=40.52s)]
*  And if you raise your weapon to a man like me, we'll return fire with superior fire. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=42.14s)]
*  Darren Carter, you think men like these are afraid of an uneducated, 125-pound punk like [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=48.760000000000005s)]
*  you that's never won a fair fight in your life and holds your gun sideways? [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=55.0s)]
*  Now, in 2016, Higgins was forced to resign in disgrace after publishing that video, so [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=59.4s)]
*  of course he immediately ran for Congress and won with 56 percent of the vote. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=64.92s)]
*  He hasn't changed a bit. [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=70.36s)]
*  Yesterday Higgins posted this racist rant about Haitian migrants in Ohio, quote, [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=71.96000000000001s)]
*  LOL, these Haitians are wild, eating pets, voodoo, nastiest country in the Western Hemisphere, [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=76.36s)]
*  cults, slapstick gangsters, but damned if they don't all feel sophisticated now, [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=81.96s)]
*  filing charges against our present VP, all these thugs better get their mind right and [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=86.67999999999999s)]
*  their ass out of our country before January 20th. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=91.55999999999999s)]
*  After widespread outrage and condemnation, including some objections from Republicans, [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=96.19999999999999s)]
*  Higgins ended up deleting the tweet. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=102.11999999999999s)]
*  And Republican Speaker of the House Mike Johnson tried to turn the whole thing into a sort of [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=104.52s)]
*  kumbaya moment about the healing powers of redemption. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=109.48s)]
*  Clay Higgins is a dear friend of mine and a colleague from Louisiana and a very frank and [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=113.72s)]
*  outspoken person. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=118.76s)]
*  I just talked to him about it. [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=119.80000000000001s)]
*  He said he went to the back and he prayed about it and he regretted it and he pulled [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=120.76s)]
*  the post down. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=124.36s)]
*  That's what you want a gentleman to do. [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=125.0s)]
*  I'm sure he probably regrets some of the language he used, but, you know, we move forward. [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=126.76s)]
*  We believe in redemption around here. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=130.44s)]
*  He prayed about it. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=132.68s)]
*  He regretted it and he pulled the post down. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=133.64000000000001s)]
*  So guess what? [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=136.6s)]
*  After Congress officially left town for six weeks, Higgins then turned around and said, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=137.32s)]
*  I'll do it again if I want to. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=140.92s)]
*  It's all true. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=143.07999999999998s)]
*  I can put up another controversial post tomorrow if you want me to. [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=143.95999999999998s)]
*  I mean, we do have freedom of speech. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=146.68s)]
*  I'll say what I want. [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=148.2s)]
*  It's not a big deal to me. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=149.32s)]
*  It's like something stuck to the bottom of my boot. [[00:02:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=150.51999999999998s)]
*  Just scrape it off and move on with my life. [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=153.23999999999998s)]
*  Jeff Charlotte has covered the far right for two decades. [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=156.68s)]
*  He's author of The Undertow, Scenes from the Slows of the War, which is a great book. [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=159.16s)]
*  And last year, he wrote a fantastic and unnerving profile of Clay Higgins entitled [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=163.16s)]
*  The Congressman Telling Trump Supporters to Buckle Up. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=167.88s)]
*  Jeff, I thought of you immediately when I saw what Higgins posted. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=171.0s)]
*  Let's start with the post, which is genuinely shocking and vile, even by the degraded standards [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=173.88s)]
*  of modern political right-wing rhetoric. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=180.04s)]
*  I'm sure you weren't surprised. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=183.64s)]
*  What was your reaction when you saw this develop yesterday? [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=184.76s)]
*  JEFF CHARLOTTE, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=187.48000000000002s)]
*  I think Clay Higgins is the latest member of the GOP to sort of carry the ball forward on [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=188.68s)]
*  an escalation of violent political rhetoric using immigrants, using Haitian-Americans who are here [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=194.36s)]
*  legally working hard in Springfield, Ohio. And he's not a bright man, but he has a long history [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=202.04000000000002s)]
*  of playing a media game. And this is one more sort of notch for him in escalating the rhetoric [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=212.76s)]
*  and moving it closer to violence, closer to the civil war that he has, in fact, [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=222.04s)]
*  fantasized about in the past. [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=229.07999999999998s)]
*  SETH STERN, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=230.44s)]
*  Yeah. Talk a little more about that, because not only is this a person who I think is clearly [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=230.68s)]
*  racist, certainly expresses racist views, he really is obsessed with this sort of idea of [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=235.8s)]
*  incipient violence, threatening violence, violence sort of haunting everything, [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=245.4s)]
*  the politics of violence. And you talk about this in the piece. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=250.28s)]
*  JEFF CHARLOTTE, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, The New York Times, [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=253.24s)]
*  Yeah. I think there's sort of two dates that you can look at in representative Higgins' life, [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=254.68s)]
*  and that goes back one to when Trump was first indicted. And a number of Freedom Caucus members [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=258.44s)]
*  I think was representative Andy Biggs, who talked about his time for war. [[00:04:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=266.20000000000005s)]
*  But Clay Higgins went further. He said, know your bridges, buckle up, 150K, [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=270.44000000000005s)]
*  know your bridges, rock steady, calm. And it was this sort of bizarre language that a lot of people [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=277.88000000000005s)]
*  thought was funny, they made fun of, they thought, here's another Republican who's incoherent. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=283.24s)]
*  What he was referring to there, though, was one to 50,000, which is a ratio of military-grade maps, [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=288.92s)]
*  hold your bridges. This is speaking to a kind of fascist fantasy, which is not so much malicious [[00:04:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=296.28000000000003s)]
*  marching on cities, but as in taking strongholds. Know the bridges, know the means of approach [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=301.56s)]
*  to your stronghold and seize it. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=308.12s)]
*  And you also cite a few other things he said in the piece. And this one really leapt out of me. [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=311.15999999999997s)]
*  He said, you say Higgins didn't win much attention when he told the Gas Industry Conference he was a [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=317.32s)]
*  three percenter, part of a militia movement that believes the US government is tyrannical and must [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=322.68s)]
*  be confronted in the spirit of Revolutionary War. There are three percenters who've been [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=327.08s)]
*  indicted and were involved in some of the stuff on January 6th in 2020 responding on Facebook. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=330.52s)]
*  While he's a sitting member of Congress on Facebook to armed Black Lives Matter protesters, [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=338.2s)]
*  Higgins promised to shoot them on sight. I drop any 10 of you where you stand. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=343.08s)]
*  Yeah, and he added 1450 FPS, which again was sort of derided as what is this guy speaking of? [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=349.23999999999995s)]
*  He's speaking of ammunition speed, 1,450 feet per second. The three percenters is part of a [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=356.12s)]
*  long history going back to 1992 when he was voting for David Duke. He's been connected to [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=363.08s)]
*  Richard Spencer, to the Oath Keepers. The three percenters he was talking about, he was talking [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=370.12s)]
*  to a gas industry meeting and he was telling them you are the three percenters, imagining them as a [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=376.03999999999996s)]
*  militia against people who are trying to fight climate change. You know, he also just, this is [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=381.71999999999997s)]
*  someone I think is fairly consistent. 2007 when he was a police officer, he was accused of striking [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=389.48s)]
*  a handcuffed suspect. He then, and then lying about it, he quit rather than being demoted. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=393.72s)]
*  So there are some actual actions in his past that suggest a kind of intimacy with violence. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=399.56s)]
*  He goes back to 2018 when he first trained as a military policeman. He is an incompetent cop. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=407.08000000000004s)]
*  I mean, two forces at least that he's been forced to resign from. And he's incompetent [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=414.52s)]
*  even by the standards of his own kind of idea about the blue line. But where that really comes [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=421.08s)]
*  to bear is when you talk about, when you look at what he's been doing, he gets derided as a [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=426.59999999999997s)]
*  congressman who doesn't achieve much. He's not trying to do legislation. You're showing a picture [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=431.4s)]
*  there of him with Ashley Babbitt's mother, Mickey Witthoff. He's the leading member of Congress in [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=435.4s)]
*  terms of pushing the conspiracy theory that January 6th was what they call a Fed surrection, [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=441.0s)]
*  that it was the FBI, that the FBI are the enemy. He speaks to the deep state. He constantly is [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=447.72s)]
*  going on podcasts and saying that he and other members of the Freedom Caucus have gathered all [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=454.76s)]
*  this secret information that they're going to reveal at a certain point coming soon. Rock steady, [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=460.04s)]
*  calm, hold on. He's always promising an apocalypse just around the corner. [[00:07:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=465.96s)]
*  Jeff Charlotte, who wrote that great profile of Clay Higgins, The Atlantic, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=471.23999999999995s)]
*  and a fantastic book about similar themes. Thank you so much for your time today. I appreciate it. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=475.08s)]
*  Thanks, Chris. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hudGFuDRHCo&t=479.64s)]
