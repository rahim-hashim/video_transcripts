# Hayes: No matter the verdict, Trump’s trial is a win for American justice
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 29, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes the criminal trial Donald Trump was turned over to the jury today [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=0.0s)]
*  12 of Trump's fellow New Yorkers. I say that somewhat tongue-in-cheek [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=5.38s)]
*  Deliberated for a total of about four and a half hours today before being dismissed for the day shortly after four o'clock [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=9.96s)]
*  Now this afternoon the jury sent two notes to judge one Mershon [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=15.200000000000001s)]
*  Requesting to rehear four sections of witness testimony as well as the judges instructions court will reconvene tomorrow morning at 930 [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=20.6s)]
*  With the court reporter reading back those relevant parts of the transcript before the jury continues to liberate [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=28.96s)]
*  Now the one consistent rule about juries is that you just do not know what they're gonna do [[00:00:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=35.32s)]
*  When you put 12 random strangers in a room the outcome is never obvious [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=40.120000000000005s)]
*  But we do know that there are three possibilities broadly [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=44.68s)]
*  The jury could acquit Donald Trump on any or all of the 34 counts against him all 12 jurors have to agree on that unanimously [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=48.0s)]
*  We could get a hung jury if all 12 jurors cannot agree either way [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=55.48s)]
*  It only takes one holdout for that outcome or the jury could decide to convict Trump if they unanimously agree [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=59.96s)]
*  He is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt again. There are 34 separate felony counts at play here [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=66.72s)]
*  So this could be mixed and matched in a variety of ways [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=72.16s)]
*  Understandably a lot of people are very invested in the outcome of this trial. I do think it matters [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=76.92s)]
*  But no matter what happens [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=82.4s)]
*  I really do believe that the process has already been a victory for the rule of law and [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=83.92s)]
*  A rebuttal to the worst most dangerous aspects of trumpism [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=88.48s)]
*  The fact the former president was investigated charged and tried by a jury of his peers [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=92.76s)]
*  Shows that no one is above the law in America. Of course, that's not Donald Trump's vision of the law in his view [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=97.76s)]
*  There is no such thing crucially as a neutral free and fair process like a trial or an election all that matters is outcome [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=103.2s)]
*  If he wins, it was fair if he loses it was rigged [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  He has said this about everything from his legal trials to multiple presidential elections to the Emmy Awards [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=113.92s)]
*  That is Donald Trump's authoritarian view of the world power trumps all the powerful get to dictate what happens [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=120.52000000000001s)]
*  It is the opposite of our core civic commitments of equal rights equal protections and equal justice under the law [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=127.76s)]
*  That we are all subject to the same fair processes and then we respect the outcomes of those processes [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=134.88s)]
*  It's the basis of the liberal democratic project [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=141.28s)]
*  In a way this first criminal trial Donald Trump has been a big test for America [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=144.92000000000002s)]
*  For the first time in our history a former president has been prosecuted and tried for committing a crime [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=149.36s)]
*  We know this process works in some of our pure democratic countries [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=154.84s)]
*  It's happened in lots of places in France in South Korea, Taiwan where former presidents have been successfully tried and convicted [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=158.72s)]
*  We've seen the process play out here on the state level [[00:02:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=166.32s)]
*  I mean for governors of Illinois have been sentenced to time in prison [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=169.16s)]
*  Most recently Rob Bukowich who had by the way his sentence commuted by none other than Donald Trump [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=173.4s)]
*  Connecticut governor John Rowland was convicted twice for corruption exactly ten years apart spending two stints in prison [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=179.28s)]
*  The former state's attorney of Baltimore was just sentenced to a year of home confinement after being convicted of perjury and mortgage fraud [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=186.12s)]
*  Now with the first trial Donald Trump nearing its conclusion this principle of equal justice for all in America [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=193.48000000000002s)]
*  Is a pretty bedrock one and just to be clear. It used to be I think a consensus one and it no longer is [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=199.44s)]
*  I mean Trump and his Republican toadies the people that are [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=205.92000000000002s)]
*  Going up to New York dressed like Donald Trump to go stand in microphones. They all reject it and [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=208.92000000000002s)]
*  Yet this trial is a real success in its own, right? [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=214.68s)]
*  For weeks Donald Trump has had to sit in a courtroom where justice is day in day out dispensed to regular citizens [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=217.64000000000001s)]
*  Faced a judge who was fair and firm while both sides presented their cases to a jury of his peers [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=223.84s)]
*  All that happened while another group of Trump lawyers are trying to convince the Supreme Court that he actually has a special status as a former president [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=228.36s)]
*  He's a special kind of citizen unbound by the normal processes of mere mortals [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=235.56s)]
*  Now Donald Trump does have more access to wealth and power and fancy lawyers than 99.9% of all criminal defendants [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=240.64000000000001s)]
*  who step into a courtroom in America [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=246.96s)]
*  And yet the process played out exactly as it should for any American [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=249.96s)]
*  He went through the full normal process of a trial as any person accused of a crime would [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=254.44s)]
*  That's what's at stake in this New York courtroom and is what is at stake in the Supreme Court's impending decision about Trump's so-called presidential immunity [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=259.48s)]
*  Ultimately our entire liberal democratic order rises and falls on our ability to produce [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=268.32s)]
*  fair and neutral processes that apply equally everyone and lead to outcomes we can all trust if it fails [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=273.56s)]
*  We have Trumpism [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=280.84s)]
*  authoritarianism [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=283.64s)]
*  So whatever the jury decides in Trump's case is not actually as important as that process [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=285.64s)]
*  The trial of Donald Trump I believe has proven that that process is not as important as the trial of Donald Trump [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=291.32s)]
*  The process works independent of the outcome and that alone is a rebuke of everything the Trump in his movement stand for [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=297.36s)]
*  Harry Lippman served as deputy assistant attorney general at Department of Justice [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=304.71999999999997s)]
*  Kathryn Christian spent over 30 years of prosecute in the Manhattan district attorney's office [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=308.24s)]
*  They both joined me now as people that as someone that worked in that office as someone has been in the trial every day [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=311.88s)]
*  Do you agree with that assessment that that as a process as a sort of you know [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=317.76s)]
*  test of American equal justice under law that independent of the outcome since [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=322.76s)]
*  the jury has it now that this has been a success. I agree it has been you know [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=328.03999999999996s)]
*  forgetting that it's Donald Trump in a former president of the United States this [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=331.58s)]
*  trial was orderly he Donald Trump inside the courtroom behaved himself relatively [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=335.2s)]
*  you know the jurors came on time you know there were no hiccups throughout [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=341.52s)]
*  the trial and most trials are like that some there are hiccups and you're right [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=348.16s)]
*  he's not above the law no one should be above the law and most defendants in many [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=353.76000000000005s)]
*  ways he has received special treatment in some of his cases and just that he [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=358.6s)]
*  has four indictments and he's free so that's one thing but it is good for [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=362.56s)]
*  people to see whatever the verdict is whether it's a conviction or acquittal or [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=367.84000000000003s)]
*  if there's no verdict the hung jury that's how the system works and you have [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=371.88s)]
*  to respect that. It's an important I'd say beautiful point really the he was [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=375.32s)]
*  brought to heel all during this trial he had to do as others do and it was it was [[00:06:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=381.8s)]
*  a full and fair sort of oversight by Judge Merchan but Merchan is really [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=387.15999999999997s)]
*  channeling the law here it was the law that made him sit the law that made him [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=393.28s)]
*  show up the law that subjected him to the same thing that happens to everyone [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=398.15999999999997s)]
*  else people are understandably jittery now could there be say a hung jury but [[00:06:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=402.52s)]
*  unanimity is one of the features of due process that he received and in a way [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=407.59999999999997s)]
*  that's secondary it's possible a political response he could be convicted [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=412.96s)]
*  and sail through but the fact that the process has happened it's majestic. Yeah [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=417.03999999999996s)]
*  this is my point I mean I get it because I just we just don't know what the jury's [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=422.76s)]
*  gonna do and I almost feel I mean if this was a Jan six trial where I feel [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=426.12s)]
*  like I know he's guilty I mean I saw it I've read the report in this case I [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=429.56s)]
*  think it was a compelling case and if I you know as a watcher I think I probably [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=434.64s)]
*  think he's guilty but again like that independence of the process and one of [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=439.68s)]
*  the things that I've been trying to balance here and I'd love to hear you [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=443.56s)]
*  both on this is we sort of await this is that you know at one level it's like you [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=445.72s)]
*  don't want to be like well everything that runs the American justice system [[00:07:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=450.32s)]
*  is great because it clearly is not and we know this and you know it having been [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=453.2s)]
*  in that building for 30 years so I don't want to say well if he's if he's [[00:07:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=456.32s)]
*  convicted it's fine like people get wrongly wrongfully convicted all the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=461.04s)]
*  time at the same time there's something so insidious to me about the entire [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=464.04s)]
*  Republican Party marshaling behind as a kind of party line that this is a [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=468.08s)]
*  corrupt enterprise to its core and that was to me the most offensive part of the [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=473.68s)]
*  trial which wasn't about the trial but the speaker of the House of [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=479.92s)]
*  Representatives senators Congress people outside of a courthouse while a [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=483.8s)]
*  trial is ongoing basically trashing the process criticizing the judge talk about [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=489.0s)]
*  attacking the independence of judiciary criticizing the judge's daughter that [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=495.32s)]
*  was a statement against the rule of law I mean the trial was ongoing and they [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=500.28000000000003s)]
*  were doing that and you know that it was shameful to me and that's even kicked up [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=504.72s)]
*  a notch in the last few days where you have Republicans lying I mean either [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=509.84s)]
*  they're they're stupid or pretending to be stupid I never know but about what [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=513.8s)]
*  exactly the jury's instructions are saying well they don't even have to be [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=517.36s)]
*  unanimous in the same crime like that has to do with this sort of step up [[00:08:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=519.8399999999999s)]
*  thing but you have Marco Rubio and others I mean just for promulgating this [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=522.36s)]
*  these sort of lies and and and calumny against Mershon and the whole process [[00:08:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=526.4s)]
*  happening now that's exactly right but that's the political sphere somewhere in [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=531.56s)]
*  a courtroom a kind of homely courtroom in Manhattan everything that we hold [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=536.68s)]
*  dear happened and it and it really demonstrated his being subject to the [[00:09:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=541.7199999999999s)]
*  same processes never I think just that part itself in fact kind of brought him [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=547.56s)]
*  down he's someone who embodies the principle that nobody can tell me what [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=551.7199999999999s)]
*  to do and here the law told him what to do and forcefully for several weeks [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=555.88s)]
*  you [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PKar8kUq50U&t=566.68s)]
