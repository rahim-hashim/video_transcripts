# ‘Atrocious investment’: Trump RNC takeover ripped by ex-chairman
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 22, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I)
*  Good evening from Washington, DC. I'm Michael Steele in for Chris Hayes as a real estate developer [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=0.0s)]
*  Donald Trump loved to put his name on OPP other people's buildings now [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=6.32s)]
*  He's about to pull off a similar rebranding on the Republican National Committee [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=11.4s)]
*  And it's going to end up pretty much like his failed Atlantic City casino [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=15.08s)]
*  After forcing one-time ally Ronald McDaniel as out as RNC chair Trump endorsed his own daughter-in-law for co-chair [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=19.98s)]
*  Today Laura Trump spoke at CPAC laying out her plan [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=28.12s)]
*  Ladies and gentlemen, I come bearing good news here today because less than nine months away from changing all that [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=33.120000000000005s)]
*  We will see Donald J. Trump elected as a 47 [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=41.040000000000006s)]
*  By going all in on this capitulation to Trump the party of fiscal responsibility is making an atrocious [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=45.56s)]
*  Investment Trump's rise has led to a diminished Republican Party [[00:00:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=52.4s)]
*  Electorily financially and infidelity to conservative values [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=57.08s)]
*  Trump has led the Republican Party on an embarrassing losing streak despite promises the GOP would quote get tired of winning a [[00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=61.199999999999996s)]
*  Few things to keep in mind the party is losing money ending last year without its with its lowest fundraising totals in a decade [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=69.12s)]
*  Laura Trump has not ruled out paying her father-in-law's mounting legal bills [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=76.88s)]
*  Donald Trump is the ultimate Rhino. Yeah, that's right [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=81.7s)]
*  He's a Rhino Republican in name only because this president Trump abandoned free trade racked up huge deficits and cozied up to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=84.98s)]
*  Authoritarians and for nearly a decade the Republican Party has been consumed by Trump's chaos division [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=93.02000000000001s)]
*  grifters and conspiracy theories now it appears this once great party once more of the same [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=99.78s)]
*  Yeah, so much for winning. I'm joined now by Sabrina Siddiqui [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=106.58000000000001s)]
*  a White House reporter for the Wall Street Journal McKay Coppins a staff writer for the Atlantic and Lucy Caldwell veteran Republican [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=110.96s)]
*  Strategist who served as campaign manager for former Illinois congressman and my buddy Joe Walsh. Thank you all for being here [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=118.16s)]
*  So Lucy, I want to begin with you on this one [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=124.72s)]
*  Could you give us some sense just some inkling of a sense of how Donald Trump managed this? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=127.83999999999999s)]
*  Complete takeover of the RNC now and what it says about the party currently and going forward [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=134.06s)]
*  Well, Michael [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=141.04000000000002s)]
*  Of course, you know about this better than anyone based on your own record and you know by your own record that this is really [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=141.68s)]
*  Something's gone wrong after Donald Trump became president. He did something kind of unprecedented [[00:02:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=148.72000000000003s)]
*  He actually went about systematically removing state party chairs throughout the country [[00:02:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=152.88000000000002s)]
*  Really shoring up the committee to make sure that like his base he it was full of loyalists [[00:02:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=157.92000000000002s)]
*  I think it's easy in an episode like this to lose sight of what it is that a national party [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=163.44s)]
*  Does what does the Republican National Committee do or what is it supposed to do? It's supposed to recruit candidates, you know [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=168.64s)]
*  Create data and technology [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=174.48s)]
*  Resources for candidates. It's supposed to build up volunteer bases [[00:02:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=177.2s)]
*  It's supposed to create infrastructure to make it easier for candidates to win to recruit high quality candidates to make them successful [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=180.79999999999998s)]
*  In the Trump era, we've seen that the Republican Committee is focused on doing the opposite [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=188.64s)]
*  And as Laura Trump herself said this week now [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=192.56s)]
*  Donald Trump's legal bills that would be you know [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=195.67999999999998s)]
*  Sort of in line with Trump doing things like using campaign funds to pay a quarter of a million dollars a year to his wife's [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=198.23999999999998s)]
*  So it's true that behind the scenes [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=204.07999999999998s)]
*  Maybe they have a slightly more serious person in Michael Wotley [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=206.07999999999998s)]
*  Who's the chair of the North Carolina Republican Party who is Trump's pick for chair? [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=208.88s)]
*  But Laura Trump should be nowhere near the co-chairship of of the RNC and I never thought I would say this [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=213.35999999999999s)]
*  But I think her talents would actually be better spent recording comments [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=218.32s)]
*  Her talents would actually be better spent recording covers of Tom Petty songs and she's not very good at that either [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=222.32s)]
*  Well, there there is that [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=228.07999999999998s)]
*  Sabrina, I think there are a couple of interesting points here particularly around the money piece [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=230.56s)]
*  I mean given given where the party is financially right now [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=235.35999999999999s)]
*  What have you discovered from your reporting or learning from your reporting about? [[00:03:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=238.88s)]
*  Whether or not the party is actually going to go through with paying these bills [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=243.04s)]
*  Can they really afford to pay the bills and win elections? [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=245.84s)]
*  Well, the RNC certainly does not have the money to pay former president Trump's legal bills [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=248.95999999999998s)]
*  you know one of the [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=254.72s)]
*  Main problems that they've had is that a lot of donors have not actually been willing to cut [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=256.4s)]
*  Large checks to the RNC in part because they don't want that money going to former president [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=261.28s)]
*  Trump and so I don't think that Laura Trump's comments are going to help with their fundraising [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=267.68s)]
*  capabilities at least with a faction [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=273.5s)]
*  Of the republican donors because that is a big concern that that money is going to be used for his extensive [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=276.06s)]
*  Legal bills rather than propping up other republican candidates and just the broader pursuit [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=283.02s)]
*  Not just of taking back the white house, but also of gains in congress [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=289.74s)]
*  But we've seen this trumpification of the entire republican political apparatus [[00:04:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=295.02s)]
*  That's been really years in the making [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=301.1s)]
*  I mean, you know fealty to trump has actually been a hallmark of the RNC even under you know, it's [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=302.86s)]
*  Soon to be outgoing leadership. I mean ronan mcdaniel really took every possible step to appease [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=308.38s)]
*  Former president trump now candidate trump. It was just that you know, she went on withholding the debates [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=314.78000000000003s)]
*  You know that was one of the sort and didn't maybe do enough [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=321.18s)]
*  in his eyes to [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=324.14s)]
*  Go after what he said was election fraud. We all know was actually a lie and a free and fair election [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=325.90000000000003s)]
*  So so, you know, I don't I I don't think that you know [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=331.42s)]
*  No matter what the RNC says about paying or not paying his legal bills or the trump campaign suggesting that they won't [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=334.21999999999997s)]
*  Pay his use RNC pays legal bills [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=339.34s)]
*  I think we know that you know the RNC and all of the the you know, republican [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=341.42s)]
*  Political apparatus would very much be used to do whatever trump tells them to do [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=345.58s)]
*  You [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bn5Wm43ZO6I&t=361.26s)]
