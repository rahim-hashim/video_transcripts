# ‘Roomba stuck in a corner’: GOP infighting escalates as Jordan loses second speaker vote
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [October 18, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes today Republican Congressman Jim Jordan of Ohio is even [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=0.0s)]
*  Further from being speaker of the house than he was yesterday in a second floor vote Jordan ended up with [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=5.64s)]
*  199 supporters a net loss from yesterday's tally as Paul Kane of the Washington Post noted [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=13.16s)]
*  Jordan set a modern record [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=19.0s)]
*  Nice work, Jim earning the lowest vote tally for a majority's nominee to be speaker now [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=20.76s)]
*  Jordan did pick up three new supporters today [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=26.6s)]
*  But he lost four members who flipped away from him this time around in total [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=28.880000000000003s)]
*  22 Republicans voted for someone other than Jordan and he can only afford to lose four [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=34.120000000000005s)]
*  So the congressman from Ohio has a lot of work ahead of him if he's going to convert enough votes to win the gavel [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=40.04s)]
*  Jordan is not giving up tonight. He told reporters the house will vote again [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=46.36s)]
*  Tomorrow afternoon and we'll keep voting as long as necessary [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=51.2s)]
*  Is the plan to vote tomorrow? [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=56.6s)]
*  I believe that's right [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=58.6s)]
*  So when do you think the vote will be tomorrow? [[00:01:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=60.6s)]
*  Before we keep popping to our colleagues like I told you [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=64.6s)]
*  How many counts are you going to do this? [[00:01:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=68.6s)]
*  You gotta get a speaker [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=70.6s)]
*  But is it going to be you? [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=72.6s)]
*  I believe so, yes [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=74.6s)]
*  In the meantime the house remains paralyzed on its 15th day without a speaker [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=75.48s)]
*  The longest vacancy of more than half a century in that last gap in 1971 [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=80.12s)]
*  Only occurred because congress actually convened rather late in January [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=84.19999999999999s)]
*  Of course, we are stuck in the current debacle because of the fundamental deepening chaos in the House Republican caucus [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=88.11999999999999s)]
*  At this point, it really does feel like they are a [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=95.47999999999999s)]
*  Melfunctioning Roomba vacuum cleaner hopelessly stuck in the corner ramming into the wall over and over again. Its sensors gone haywire [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=98.32s)]
*  But they keep going. I mean the current path is pretty clearly not working [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=106.64s)]
*  Jim Jordan is 18 votes away from majority. The thing is not exactly a unifying figure [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=110.88000000000001s)]
*  He's an extreme far-right coup plotter [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=116.76s)]
*  And the politics of voting for someone like that are not going to change in 24 hours for the people that [[00:01:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=119.64s)]
*  Hold out from voting for him and are in vulnerable seats [[00:02:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=125.68s)]
*  Now the pressure campaign to bully those members into voting for him from Jordan from Donald Trump from Fox News [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=129.52s)]
*  Hasn't worked it's failed so far [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=137.4s)]
*  If the Republican Party does not want to keep ramming into the wall [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=140.8s)]
*  Embarrassingly in front of the entire nation and world over and over and over again. They need to change direction [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=144.76s)]
*  They could find someone else to be the nominee for speaker [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=151.0s)]
*  Although choosing a nominee the caucus can get behind obviously easier said than done as we're seeing [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=153.64000000000001s)]
*  Or they could compromise with Democrats [[00:02:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=159.08s)]
*  It would only take five Republicans meeting with Democratic leadership to craft some sort of deal and [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=161.92s)]
*  elect minority leader Hakeem Jeffries to the speakership or [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=168.16s)]
*  If they don't like that, which I expect they don't choose someone else even a Republican under some kind of agreed-to-power [[00:02:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=172.56s)]
*  sharing pact [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=180.8s)]
*  So far, they don't seem willing to do that [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=182.8s)]
*  Another option that some people have been floating would be to expand the role of the temporary speaker Patrick McHenry at the moment [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=186.08s)]
*  under the current house rules his powers are [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=193.4s)]
*  Essentially ministerial basically limited to gaveling in and out until a permanent speaker is elected [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=196.84s)]
*  But the New York Times reports Republican David Joyce of Ohio has been circulating a bipartisan plan [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=202.08s)]
*  That would give McHenry the power to run the house floor through early January [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=207.76s)]
*  Members of the bipartisan problem solvers caucus made up of center-leading members from both parties have also been involved in the talks [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=212.96s)]
*  to former House speakers [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=220.84s)]
*  interestingly [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=224.04000000000002s)]
*  Newt Gingrich and John Boehner [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=225.44000000000003s)]
*  Endorsed the plan last night now to be clear. First of all, no one even knows how this would work precisely to have to change rules [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=227.92000000000002s)]
*  Elevating McHenry would be completely unprecedented as far as anyone can tell it also would not solve the underlying problem of Republican Party [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=235.72000000000003s)]
*  Set on sewing chaos as Hakeem Jeffries laid out this afternoon after a Democratic caucus meeting [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=242.48000000000002s)]
*  Do you talk to me about the point of this caucus meeting? Is it just to take the temperature on McHenry? [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=249.44000000000003s)]
*  There are two things that [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=256.40000000000003s)]
*  Were important for us to accomplish this week first stop Jim [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=258.2s)]
*  Jordan who is a clear and present danger to our democracy and the poster child for Republican [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=263.36s)]
*  Extremism the second is to reopen the house so we can do the business of the American people [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=270.59999999999997s)]
*  And our preference is to reopen the house in a bipartisan way so we can govern in an enlightened way [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=277.11999999999995s)]
*  Moving forward does that mean McHenry is a path [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=285.15999999999997s)]
*  This conversation will not be about any one individual because we're concerned about two things the institution of the Congress and [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=289.52s)]
*  The best interests of the American people I gotta say the Patrick McHenry plan [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=298.47999999999996s)]
*  Speaks so perfectly to the trajectory of the Republican Party back in 2005 [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=303.32s)]
*  McHenry was a freshman congressman. He was a firebrand one of the furthest right members of the party he was [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=308.2s)]
*  profiled in magazines as such [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=315.96s)]
*  18 years later McHenry is being floated as the [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=319.12s)]
*  Institutional savior to rescue the Republicans from their latest iteration of hard-right rebels and this time around that faction is so [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=322.79999999999995s)]
*  Dangerous to American democracy and so strong within the Republican Party. They are threatening to bring the entire institution [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=330.2s)]
*  down on their own heads [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=337.11999999999995s)]
*  You [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=478K5d48yiw&t=352.28s)]
