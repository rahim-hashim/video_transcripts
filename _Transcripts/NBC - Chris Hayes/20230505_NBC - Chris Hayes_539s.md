# Trump defends Access Hollywood tape: Stars have 'historically' grabbed women
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 05, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4)
*  In Donald Trump's civil rape trial, the infamous 2005 Access Hollywood tape where he grabs [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=0.0s)]
*  about assaulting women was shown as an exhibit to the jury yesterday. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=6.5600000000000005s)]
*  Not only did the jury watch the video itself, they got to watch Trump during the October [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=11.4s)]
*  deposition watching the infamous video in real time. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=15.040000000000001s)]
*  You know, and... [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=18.64s)]
*  She used me, but she's still great. [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=19.64s)]
*  I moved on her, actually. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=22.48s)]
*  You know, she was down on Palm Beach. [[00:00:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=23.64s)]
*  I moved on her and I failed. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=24.8s)]
*  I'll admit it. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=26.32s)]
*  Whoa. [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=27.32s)]
*  I did try and f*** her. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=28.32s)]
*  That's huge news there. [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=29.36s)]
*  No, no, Nancy... [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=30.36s)]
*  No, this was... [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=31.36s)]
*  And I moved on her very heavily. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=32.36s)]
*  In fact, I took her out furniture shopping. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=34.32s)]
*  She wanted to get some furniture. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=36.96s)]
*  I said, I'll show you where they have some nice furniture. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=37.96s)]
*  I took her out furniture. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=40.24s)]
*  I moved on her like a b***h. [[00:00:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=41.24s)]
*  But I couldn't get there. [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=42.24s)]
*  And she was married. [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=44.44s)]
*  I'm automatically attracted to beautiful women. [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=45.44s)]
*  I just start kissing them. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=46.92s)]
*  It's like a magnet. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=47.92s)]
*  I just... [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=48.92s)]
*  I don't even know what... [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=49.92s)]
*  And when you're a star, they let you do it. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=50.92s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=53.44s)]
*  Whatever you want. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=54.44s)]
*  Grab them by the b***h. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=55.44s)]
*  I can do anything. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=56.44s)]
*  I can do anything. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=57.44s)]
*  Eugene Carroll's attorney then asked Trump about those comments and he basically admitted [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=59.64s)]
*  to doing exactly what he said. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=62.96s)]
*  He really did. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=64.6s)]
*  And you did say in the video that you, quote, moved on her heavily, correct? [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=67.24s)]
*  Excuse me? [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=71.08s)]
*  You do say in the video that you, quote, moved on her heavily. [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=72.08s)]
*  I did say that, yes, absolutely. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=75.28s)]
*  And you do say in the video that as part of trying to have sex with this woman, you took [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=77.64s)]
*  her furniture shopping, correct? [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=82.4s)]
*  We actually did look for furniture, yes. [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=86.08s)]
*  So that was true. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=88.72s)]
*  You actually took this woman in... [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=91.2s)]
*  I think so. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=92.2s)]
*  I've been spinning a long time ago. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=93.2s)]
*  It's how long is it? [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=94.44s)]
*  Long time ago. [[00:01:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=96.36s)]
*  But I think so. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=97.36s)]
*  I do think so. [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=99.16s)]
*  Is that the only occasion when you took a woman shopping? [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=100.44s)]
*  I think so. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=102.88s)]
*  And you say, and again this has become very famous, in this video, I just start kissing [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=104.2s)]
*  them. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=109.8s)]
*  It's like a magnet. [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=110.8s)]
*  Just kiss. [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=111.8s)]
*  I don't even wait. [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=112.8s)]
*  And when you're a star, they let you do it. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=114.12s)]
*  You can do anything. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=116.44s)]
*  Grab them by the... you can do anything. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=118.10000000000001s)]
*  That's what you said, correct? [[00:02:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=120.4s)]
*  Well, historically that's true with stars. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=121.4s)]
*  It's true with stars that they can grab women by the... [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=123.4s)]
*  Well, that's what... if you look over the last million years, I guess that's been largely [[00:02:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=126.44s)]
*  true. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=131.6s)]
*  Not always, but largely true. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=132.6s)]
*  Unfortunately or fortunately. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=134.88s)]
*  And you consider yourself to be a star? [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=137.08s)]
*  I think you can say that, yeah. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=142.6s)]
*  Unfortunately or fortunately. [[00:02:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=145.0s)]
*  MSNBC legal analyst Lisa Rubin was in the courtroom when the jury saw all that and she [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=147.16s)]
*  joins me now. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=151.72s)]
*  What a strange sort of inception moment. [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=154.0s)]
*  They're watching... they're in the jury room watching a deposition in which he's small [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=156.07999999999998s)]
*  screened while they play the Access Hollywood tape. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=160.6s)]
*  Just what was that like in the room during the 45 minutes of deposition excerpts they [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=163.4s)]
*  got to see? [[00:02:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=168.4s)]
*  Bizarre. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=169.68s)]
*  You can see him sort of trying to think on his feet too because initially in a portion [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=170.68s)]
*  that you guys didn't show, he's saying, oh, this has been litigated already. [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=174.92000000000002s)]
*  That's locker room talk, locker room talk. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  I think I said that in a debate. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=180.6s)]
*  And then he is confronted with the tape itself and his words and then he owns them, right? [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=182.96s)]
*  Historically that's been true, fortunately or unfortunately. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=190.4s)]
*  And then he says... she says, oh, that's true. [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=194.38s)]
*  You can... [[00:03:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=197.36s)]
*  Stars can do that. [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=198.36s)]
*  And his response is breathtaking, right? [[00:03:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=200.07999999999998s)]
*  For a million years. [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=204.48s)]
*  I didn't know that the Hollywood studio system was a million years old. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=205.48s)]
*  But for a million years, and you consider yourself a star, I think it's fair to say [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=209.0s)]
*  that, that is essentially going from minimizing the statement entirely from locker room talk [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=212.76s)]
*  to I'm going to own this and be, I don't know, an expert on history of how the star system [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=218.76s)]
*  has evolved in this country. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=224.28s)]
*  It's also the ideology of sexual predation. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=225.84s)]
*  I mean, it's the belief system of dominance and predation, which is basically if you [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=228.0s)]
*  have a certain status, consent doesn't matter, which is what it's articulated in the video [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=231.68s)]
*  and what he reaffirms as his binding belief there. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=236.07999999999998s)]
*  Which is also why the she's not my type statements are so bizarre. [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=240.16s)]
*  So to go back to your point, right? [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=244.16s)]
*  If sexual assault is fundamentally about predation and control and dominance and violence, whether [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=246.0s)]
*  or not you're someone's physical type really doesn't have anything to do with it at all. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=251.56s)]
*  And it's also, I mean, I want to play a little bit of his insults just during the deposition [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=256.4s)]
*  because this is what he does. [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=259.8s)]
*  He's a person who is wildly insecure, is sort of driven above all things by his insecurity, [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=262.4s)]
*  and that insecurity turns into this sort of lashing out insults. [[00:04:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=270.24s)]
*  And this is him just sort of his various insults that were played during the deposition. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=273.92s)]
*  Take a look. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=279.48s)]
*  I still don't know this woman. [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=280.48s)]
*  I think she's a whack job, but I know nothing about her. [[00:04:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=283.24s)]
*  I think she's sick, mentally sick. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=286.48s)]
*  You wouldn't be a choice of mine either, to be honest with you. [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=288.72s)]
*  I hope you're not insulted. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=290.96s)]
*  I would not under any circumstances have any interest in you. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=292.32s)]
*  I'm honest when I say it. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=297.84s)]
*  This is Ravi Kaplan, one of the sort of most celebrated litigators and out gay women in [[00:04:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=299.78s)]
*  the American bar. [[00:05:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=305.8s)]
*  But it just seems to me that like, I don't know. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=308.08s)]
*  I just don't know how that like, truculence and insolence and then just sort of owning [[00:05:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=311.4s)]
*  it reads to the jury. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=315.91999999999996s)]
*  I mean, there's no way to know. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=317.35999999999996s)]
*  There really isn't any way to know. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=318.76s)]
*  I will say that the courtroom was really silent during the playing of this deposition. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=319.91999999999996s)]
*  And even though there were people like me in the courtroom who have read excerpts of [[00:05:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=325.35999999999996s)]
*  this, right? [[00:05:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=328.96s)]
*  We have seen excerpts of this deposition before. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=329.96s)]
*  They were released as part of the filings in this case in January. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=331.64s)]
*  I think I actually was here with you, Chris, and we talked about them when they were first [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=334.0s)]
*  Despite that, seeing him own them, saying them, his body language was really wild. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=338.0s)]
*  And you could hear a pin drop in that courtroom. [[00:05:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=344.72s)]
*  So on Monday, we have closing arguments. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=347.2s)]
*  There was a little bit. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=351.08s)]
*  I want to this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=352.08s)]
*  This is a back and forth from yesterday. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=353.08s)]
*  And I think this is about this, you know, Trump boasting that he's going to come back, [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=354.08s)]
*  right? [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=358.2s)]
*  Which he's not going to do. [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=359.2s)]
*  I mean, eat my hat if he does. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=360.2s)]
*  This is a takapina. [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=362.12s)]
*  I'm going to rest. [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=363.52s)]
*  I'm telling you right now. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=364.52s)]
*  I'm going to rest. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=365.52s)]
*  I'm going to talk to Takapina, OK, judge, and that may well prove to be the case, but [[00:06:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=367.03999999999996s)]
*  I will wait and see. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=369.68s)]
*  Takapina then, judge, and I'm not implying dishonesty on your part, meaning that when [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=370.68s)]
*  you say you rest, Takapina says, no, I know you're not. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=375.08s)]
*  I know you're not. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=378.08s)]
*  I know you're not. [[00:06:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=379.08s)]
*  I know you understand what I'm dealing with. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=380.08s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  To a person, everyone who ever has worked with him at some point is in this position [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=383.15999999999997s)]
*  of being like, you understand. [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=389.9s)]
*  Yes. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=392.4s)]
*  And there was a moment, you know, the part that you just read happened outside the earshot, [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=393.68s)]
*  not only of the jury, but of all of the observers in the courtroom. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=397.92s)]
*  It was published in the transcript that we got today. [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=400.84000000000003s)]
*  But when they came out from that conversation, they sort of rehashed that conversation publicly [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=403.42s)]
*  in front of everyone. [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=407.92s)]
*  And I noticed Judge Kaplan was very gentle towards Joe Takapina and basically said the [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=408.92s)]
*  same thing publicly. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=413.0s)]
*  I'm not implying that you are being dishonest, Mr. Takapina, with the court. [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=414.20000000000005s)]
*  There seemed to be a sort of simpatico between them. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=417.58000000000004s)]
*  I understand the difficult position you're in. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=420.16s)]
*  Donald Trump does this, as you said, to each and every one of his lawyers. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=423.1s)]
*  Closing argument, Monique. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=428.28000000000003s)]
*  Just final thought here. [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=429.28000000000003s)]
*  I mean, there is a reason, right? [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=430.28000000000003s)]
*  The majority of sexual assaults are not reported. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=432.12s)]
*  Those that are reported very few go to trial. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=434.12s)]
*  When they do go to trial, it can be very hard to secure a conviction. [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=437.24s)]
*  This is decades after the incident. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=439.92s)]
*  It's in a civil trial, so there's a different standard of evidence, preponderance of the [[00:07:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=442.40000000000003s)]
*  evidence as opposed to beyond a reasonable doubt. [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=445.24s)]
*  And yet, for all the reasons that it is difficult to secure justice in a courtroom under laws [[00:07:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=447.28s)]
*  of evidence of a sexual assault, it doesn't strike me that this is necessarily a slam [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=453.05999999999995s)]
*  dunk. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=457.84s)]
*  It's not necessarily a slam dunk for a lot of the reasons that you just recalled. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=458.84s)]
*  And I think that's less to do with whether she screamed or whether she reported to the [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=461.84s)]
*  fact that she can't pinpoint certain details. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=466.08s)]
*  And they were able to chip away at her case. [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=468.96s)]
*  One of the things that you and I talked about on a break is that at one point somebody sent [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=471.23999999999995s)]
*  an email to E. Jean Carroll saying, Hey, are you aware of the fact that there's a law and [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=476.0s)]
*  order episode that's largely about the same constellation of facts that you say is what [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=480.56s)]
*  happened to you in Verdorf Goodman? [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=485.52000000000004s)]
*  If the jury is entitled to rely on that, that could be hugely damaging because it's essentially [[00:08:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=487.6s)]
*  a vehicle for tachypneuses to suggest you made this all up after seeing it on TV. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=491.76s)]
*  And so I do think that there are things for the jury to hang their hat on here, namely [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=496.56s)]
*  the corroboration from the two people she told in real time and the other two accusers, [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=500.88s)]
*  particularly Natasha Stoyanov, who was one of the most credible witnesses I've ever seen [[00:08:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=505.24s)]
*  in a courtroom. [[00:08:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=509.0s)]
*  But at the same time, we still live in a society where victims don't report for a reason. [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=510.04s)]
*  Lisa Rubin, thank you so much for joining us. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=515.8s)]
*  Have a great weekend. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ps4OWNm0rU4&t=518.12s)]
