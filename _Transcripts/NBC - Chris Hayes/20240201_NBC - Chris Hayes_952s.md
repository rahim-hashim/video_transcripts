# Watch All In With Chris Hayes Highlights: Jan. 31
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [February 01, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It is 2024 and the American economy is back, baby. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=0.0s)]
*  You don't have to take my word for it. As we've been covering for months on this show, [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=6.96s)]
*  there has been and is a gap, lingering gap between the way the economy is actually [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=11.120000000000001s)]
*  performing based on every metric we have, which is incredibly well, and the way voters say they [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=15.84s)]
*  feel about the economy, which has been quite pessimistic. It every day brings some new bit [[00:00:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=21.28s)]
*  of data that demonstrates that the American economy is roaring. Today, it is this chart, [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=26.24s)]
*  which you might call the GDP Olympics of all of the most developed economies on earth. [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=32.32s)]
*  Which one do you think is growing the fastest? Well, it's Joe Biden's United States by a lot. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=38.16s)]
*  That big green bar at the top is our GDP here in the good old US of A. Do you see how much [[00:00:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=45.12s)]
*  bigger it is than all the others? The US is literally the best economy in the world. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=51.44s)]
*  Last year, our economy grew much faster than Japan, the second best economy, [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=58.4s)]
*  more than double the rate of Canada and a distant third. Not only that, [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=62.56s)]
*  but we are projected to blow the competition out of the water again this year. And this is just [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=66.48s)]
*  one data point among many. Wages in real terms, real wages, the amount of actual purchasing power [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=73.12s)]
*  are rising. Inflation, by some measures, is falling below the Fed's target. With an anticipation, [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=79.68s)]
*  they may start cutting interest rates. Investment in manufacturing has now set record highs. New [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=85.52000000000001s)]
*  business formation, that's people making small businesses, has set record highs. Household wealth [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=93.36000000000001s)]
*  has set a record high. And today, amid all this good news, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell got [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=100.0s)]
*  just about as enthusiastic as it is possible for a central banker like him when discussing the state [[00:01:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=107.28s)]
*  of the US economy. The labor market, 3.7% unemployment indicates that the labor market is strong. We've had [[00:01:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=113.04s)]
*  just about two years now of unemployment under 4%. That hasn't happened in 50 years, so it's a good [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=121.76s)]
*  labor market. And we've seen inflation come down. We've talked about that. So we've got six months [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=129.04s)]
*  of good inflation data and an expectation that there's more to come. So this is a good situation, [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=133.36s)]
*  let's be honest. This is a good economy. Just to be clear, for a Fed chair, that's the equivalent [[00:02:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=139.68s)]
*  of stripping off your clothes and twerking for three minutes straight. That's like no one does [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=144.48000000000002s)]
*  that. The last three years, the Biden administration has essentially, get this, put us back on track [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=149.52s)]
*  economically in a better spot than if COVID hadn't happened. I want to say that again. As the White [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=155.84s)]
*  House noted a few weeks ago, quote, the level of U.S. real GDP in 2023 even exceeded some pre- [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=162.56s)]
*  pandemic forecasts, including that of Congressional Budget Office and the IMF. That's right. The [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=170.08s)]
*  economy did better last year than the economic projection showed before the pandemic, before [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=176.48s)]
*  COVID, when nobody knew there would be this cataclysmic event and recession in 2020. [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=182.24s)]
*  Back in 2019, the Congressional Budget Office, for example, thought GDP would grow by an average [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=187.68s)]
*  of 1.7% in 2023. Again, looking out into the future, not knowing there's going to be a pandemic. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=192.8s)]
*  It actually grew at 2.5%. And speaking of the pandemic, Trump and his supporters often argue [[00:03:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=198.4s)]
*  it's unfair to compare Biden's economy to Trump's since again, COVID tanked the world economy in [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=205.60000000000002s)]
*  2020. But here's the thing, listen to this, okay? If you ignore 2020, Joe Biden was not president, [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=210.64s)]
*  Donald Trump was, but let's just throw it out, okay? If you ignore 2020, the economy under Biden [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=219.2s)]
*  is still doing better than Trump's was. Take away COVID, give him a mulligan. As the Washington [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=224.39999999999998s)]
*  Monthly notes, quote, under Biden, from January 2022 to December 2023, employment grew at an [[00:03:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=231.35999999999999s)]
*  average annual rate of 2.4% compared to a 1.5% rate under Trump from January 2017 to February 2020. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=237.28s)]
*  So again, if you bend over backwards to give Donald Trump the most favorable comparison possible, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=246.8s)]
*  where you completely take him off the hook for the economy tanking under his watch when he was [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=252.16s)]
*  president due to COVID, and you ignore the first year of the Biden presidency when they had the [[00:04:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=256.56s)]
*  huge boom as the world reopened, take that all off the board, Joe Biden's economy is still whooping [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=261.44s)]
*  Trump's butt. So the question becomes, if the economy is doing so well, well, I don't voters [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=268.08s)]
*  think it is, and I think that's starting to change. There are basically two reasons. So [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=275.52s)]
*  one thing you've got to realize is simple partisanship. Republicans will never give [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=280.08s)]
*  a Democrat credit for a good economy, and while there's the same thing vice versa and reverse, [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=284.24s)]
*  it's asymmetric, which is to say Democrats are more willing to give Republicans credit. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=289.92s)]
*  So here's just one example, and there's a lot of charts that look like this. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=294.24s)]
*  Just days after the networks called the 2020 election for Joe Biden, there's a poll [[00:04:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=298.32s)]
*  asking Democrats and Republicans how they felt about the economy going forward, and suddenly, [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=303.44s)]
*  in that red line, Republicans feel very pessimistic about the economy. Democrats start [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=307.68s)]
*  to feel better. This is before Joe Biden was even sworn into office, but if you stay with [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=312.8s)]
*  this graph for a second, one thing I want you to notice there, the drop by Republicans is way more [[00:05:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=316.08s)]
*  than the gain in Democrats. You see that? Republicans are way more partisan in their view of the economy [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=323.03999999999996s)]
*  than Democrats, even though both sides are pretty partisan. So that's one of the things going on. [[00:05:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=329.12s)]
*  There's a chunk of the population that is never going to give pollsters a positive reaction to a [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=335.03999999999996s)]
*  Joe Biden or Democratic economy. But for other folks who might not be very partisan or political, [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=340.15999999999997s)]
*  there's just a lag. There is a lag between when the economy starts to improve in the numbers [[00:05:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=346.08s)]
*  and when people feel it, when they feel more secure. That lag is starting to go away. [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=351.44s)]
*  We're starting to see people catch up to reality. You could see it in consumer confidence numbers, [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=358.32s)]
*  which are improving. This is a problem for the Republicans because they want the economy to do [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=362.71999999999997s)]
*  poorly under Joe Biden. You have an economy that's so fragile, and the only reason it's running now is [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=369.2s)]
*  it's running off the fumes of what we did, what the Trump administration did. It's just running off the fumes. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=375.84s)]
*  And when there's a crash, I hope it's going to be during this next 12 months, because I don't want [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=382.15999999999997s)]
*  to be Herbert Hoover. The one president, I just don't want to be Herbert Hoover. I mean, he kind [[00:06:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=388.79999999999995s)]
*  of was Herbert Hoover because, again, he was president in 2020 when the whole thing crashed, [[00:06:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=394.0s)]
*  so he's already that. Also, Lindell TV on Jan 6. Beautiful touch there. So Trump hasn't gotten his [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=398.55999999999995s)]
*  wish with the stock market, even though he's rooting for it to crash. The stock market is [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=405.6s)]
*  booming. The Dow is setting record highs. The economic recovery is so good that even Fox has [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=409.20000000000005s)]
*  to begrudgingly acknowledge it. Now take a look at this headline in the Washington Post. We bring [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=415.68s)]
*  it to you again because it was kind of a standout. It says, falling inflation and rising growth gives [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=422.88s)]
*  the US the world's best recovery. Steve Forbes with me this morning. I think the Democrats are [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=428.8s)]
*  going to run with that headline. I mean, they're just going to plaster this all over the place. [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=434.48s)]
*  But are they right? Is America, does America now have the best recovery? Well, yes. I'll bet [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=438.32s)]
*  that the next time KJP or the president takes any kind of questions of any kind on the economy, [[00:07:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=445.28000000000003s)]
*  that Washington Post article is going to be right there front and center. We've got the best [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=451.20000000000005s)]
*  recovery. And that's a pretty good political slogan in an election year. Yes, also helped by the fact [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=455.28000000000003s)]
*  that it is just plainly the truth. So it's getting to the point where Republicans can no longer ignore [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=460.56s)]
*  reality, right? Which is why instead of denigrating the economy, get this, Donald Trump is now [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=466.32s)]
*  trying to take credit for it on social media, like from one day to the next, which of course [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=471.84s)]
*  is the Trump playbook. Anything bad that happens isn't his fault. Well, he deserves credit for [[00:07:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=476.0s)]
*  anything good under his watch. It's something his press secretary noted when the first full [[00:08:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=480.24s)]
*  jobs report of the Trump presidency was released. In the past, the president has referred to [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=485.28s)]
*  particular job reports as phony or totally fiction. Does the president believe that this jobs report [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=491.03999999999996s)]
*  was accurate and a fair way to measure the economy? Yeah, I talked to the president prior to this, [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=496.15999999999997s)]
*  and he said to quote him very clearly, they may have been phony in the past, but it's very real now. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=501.11999999999995s)]
*  Ha ha, very funny. Reality doesn't matter. Nothing matters. It's good when I say it, [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=507.35999999999996s)]
*  when I'm in power, it's made up when I'm not, right? That's the whole thing. But this idea [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=512.08s)]
*  that Trump actually deserves credit for the Biden economy is just too ridiculous to reach most people. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=516.56s)]
*  Honestly, like some hardcore partisans are going to be like, yes, it's a Trump stock market or whatever [[00:08:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=521.84s)]
*  ludicrousness, but that's not going to work for most voters. That is why Republicans are simply [[00:08:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=527.2s)]
*  trying to just change the subject, change the subject. They love to talk about kitchen table [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=532.56s)]
*  issues and the price of eggs, all that stuff like six months ago. Now, no, they are reaching [[00:08:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=539.36s)]
*  for their political safety blanket, which is called immigration. That makes them feel safe [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=544.24s)]
*  when they're talking about immigration. So right now they are trying to impeach the homeland security [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=549.04s)]
*  secretary the first time in 150 years to impeach a sitting cabinet secretary, 170 years, because they [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=554.96s)]
*  get this disagree with his immigration policy. They think he's not doing a good job and they're [[00:09:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=560.48s)]
*  doing this in hopes that Americans will pay more attention to immigration, the economy. [[00:09:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=566.72s)]
*  And it's not a crazy idea. There are some signs that might be working. We've got some polling out [[00:09:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=570.48s)]
*  today that indicates that voters are starting to care more about immigration than the economy, [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=574.64s)]
*  like, oh, the economy is fixed. Well, I don't care about that. But even as Republicans try to [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=578.72s)]
*  get you to chase this shiny object, it's crucial for Democrats and also for just fair minded [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=584.1600000000001s)]
*  journalists and reporters everywhere not to lose sight of the facts. Again, setting aside politics [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=589.52s)]
*  ideology, just based on the metrics we have, we have a lot of numbers about the economy. It's [[00:09:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=594.24s)]
*  the thing we measure basically more than anything. Okay. President Biden has done the best job [[00:09:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=598.4s)]
*  digging the economy out of a deep hole that we have seen since FDR. Joining me now is Stephanie [[00:10:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=603.6s)]
*  Ruhl, senior business analyst at NBC News, host of the 11th hour here on MSNBC and someone who's [[00:10:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=610.16s)]
*  been covering the economy a lot on your program. I came here because I thought I was getting Jerome [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=614.32s)]
*  Powell stripped down and twerking. I see none of that. And you just laid out the, you did all the [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=619.84s)]
*  economic news. There's nothing left for me to do. And you delivered me no twerking. So like, I got [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=626.32s)]
*  nothing. Well, first of all, I'm right that him saying I was sort of, I couldn't get over that [[00:10:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=630.72s)]
*  clip because central bankers are very evenly measured. Markets move on adjectives they used [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=635.2s)]
*  for him to be like, guys. That's huge. Right? People measure every twitch of his nose, just [[00:10:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=641.5200000000001s)]
*  like Janet Yellen last week kind of ran a victory lap. I mean, when it comes to the administration [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=650.08s)]
*  and Janet Yellen doing that, both of these things are huge. Now, Jerome Powell is not working for [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=655.84s)]
*  the administration, but he is signaling to the markets. Yes, that rate cut is likely coming, [[00:11:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=661.5200000000001s)]
*  not today, because he certainly doesn't want to be too early. But the administration is also [[00:11:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=667.92s)]
*  realizing you laid it out. They've got all this great economic data. They need to do a better job [[00:11:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=672.4799999999999s)]
*  messaging this. And you said, listen, Trump does such a great job lying about it and convincing [[00:11:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=678.16s)]
*  people. Democrats need to do a better job talking about it. Look at oil production, Chris. Why aren't [[00:11:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=683.04s)]
*  we hearing from this White House? We have, we're producing more oil than we ever have in history. [[00:11:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=688.8s)]
*  Why? Because they don't want to piss off the far left. Just like oftentimes in economic terms, [[00:11:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=694.56s)]
*  Democrats should talk about a lot of economic wins. They're often concerned about the people [[00:11:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=702.2399999999999s)]
*  who are left out. And I get that, but they have got to start running a victory lap because if [[00:11:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=707.4399999999999s)]
*  they're worried about those people left out, they're going to be real left out if Trump wins. [[00:11:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=711.68s)]
*  Well, first of all, let me just highlight the oil production. I think, and I might be saying, [[00:11:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=715.76s)]
*  I don't think that just we're producing more oil than we ever have. If I'm not mistaken, [[00:12:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=720.0s)]
*  the U.S. is producing more oil now than any nation on earth. Correct. And than any nation on earth [[00:12:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=724.0s)]
*  has ever produced. Double correct. Okay. I want to say that again. The U.S. is currently producing [[00:12:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=729.04s)]
*  more oil than any nation on earth has ever produced. Now, if you're someone who's worried [[00:12:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=733.84s)]
*  about the climate, as I am, you hear that, you go, oh, that's not great. Here's what I will say. [[00:12:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=737.76s)]
*  That's true. Not great. The theory of the case the Biden administration have is the only way you [[00:12:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=742.24s)]
*  create political sustainable transition is to keep oil prices low because when they spike up, [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=747.76s)]
*  the politics on the issue go bananas. Yes. I think it's a perfectly credible theory of the case, [[00:12:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=752.96s)]
*  but they have to communicate it. And also, if you're going to put the carbon in the air, [[00:12:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=757.84s)]
*  which we're doing, you might as well reap the political benefit as opposed to being hush hush [[00:12:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=762.4s)]
*  about it. A hundred percent. In the same breath, after Davos, my head was spinning that you kept [[00:12:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=766.64s)]
*  hearing more and more CEOs kind of like open to this idea of Trump and a mad dialing people like, [[00:12:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=773.52s)]
*  is this for real? And I learned two things. A, it's, listen, they have to play ball because [[00:12:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=779.52s)]
*  there's no CEO of a Fortune 500 company out there right now who wants to be the next Bob Iger CEO [[00:13:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=785.68s)]
*  of Disney with a politician gunning for them. And they know there's the possibility it could be Trump [[00:13:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=791.76s)]
*  and they don't want to be a target. Right. But B, they're also egotistical. Yeah. And they like [[00:13:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=796.8s)]
*  to be called. Yeah. And president Biden, while he has lots of winning policies, does not parade [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=802.32s)]
*  that around the world. And I'm not saying that he should, but they like to get the call. And one of [[00:13:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=807.7600000000001s)]
*  them gave me this line that I thought was really interesting because I was like, look at this data. [[00:13:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=813.2s)]
*  How can you say he's not pro-business? And he said to me, you can tell a person's priorities based on [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=817.12s)]
*  their schedule. Joe Biden doesn't call us that. I'm not saying that he should, but I'm telling you, [[00:13:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=822.8000000000001s)]
*  that's the site. That is an amazing anecdote. I also heard an anecdote at the time that bill, [[00:13:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=828.24s)]
*  Joe Biden met Bill Ackman, that big hedge fund guy and said about him, who is this a hole, [[00:13:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=832.24s)]
*  which I think is a funny thing I've ever heard. That is a story that was supposed to stay in Vegas, [[00:13:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=836.72s)]
*  but like all stories didn't. Okay. So that's that what you just said is actually really important [[00:14:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=841.84s)]
*  because part of, so there's two elements to this sort of gap that we've had so far. [[00:14:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=846.4s)]
*  One of the weird things is, so there's a gap between people self-reporting, how they feel [[00:14:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=850.56s)]
*  about the economy and the numbers, but there's also this weird gap between people who were like [[00:14:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=854.64s)]
*  CEOs. You pull them, they're like all pessimistic. They got it all wrong. By the way, [[00:14:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=858.88s)]
*  they were wrong. Like they just were wrong about what happened, but you would think that their [[00:14:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=863.92s)]
*  bottom line matters more and they can't afford bias as much as someone further removed. [[00:14:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=870.64s)]
*  And it does seem to me like that class of folks, the people that watch business television, [[00:14:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=876.08s)]
*  business reporters, business people are like, okay, yeah, it's a good economy. Am I right about that? [[00:14:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=880.4s)]
*  Absolutely. They have finally been like, yeah, all right. It's a good economy. It's a good economy. [[00:14:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=884.5600000000001s)]
*  No, I mean, they're not just shouting from the rooftops. This is the best ever. Cause remember [[00:14:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=888.8000000000001s)]
*  also you run a big business right now. What do you have an empty office building? Right. Yeah. [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=893.0400000000001s)]
*  Okay. It's not like, they do. They get, there's not an employees to stroke there. Where are these [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=897.6800000000001s)]
*  people? They're going to be so nice to me all day. This is an issue. You know, they've got a good [[00:15:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=903.5200000000001s)]
*  economy. They're not going to say it is a bad economy. It's a strong one. And you nailed that [[00:15:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=909.84s)]
*  perfectly. This is exactly why Republicans are pivoting to immigration. But here's the problem. [[00:15:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=915.76s)]
*  If Republicans keep punting on this immigration deal, Joe Biden's going to show up with the [[00:15:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=921.6s)]
*  receipts. Yes. Totally. To say, I had a deal. You wouldn't sign. That's right. Stephanie Ruhl. [[00:15:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=926.0s)]
*  Thank you. What a pleasure. Thank you. [[00:15:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tu6Z0h-GbKQ&t=930.48s)]
