# Trump World ‘panicking’ as Project 2025 gets on the radar of voters
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [July 05, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY)
*  As we've been covering in the program, Project 2025 is a MAGO world manifesto and a vision [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=0.0s)]
*  of implementing a startlingly authoritarian form of the U.S. government. [[00:00:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=6.72s)]
*  It's 900 pages long. [[00:00:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=11.64s)]
*  You can Google it right now and read it. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=12.8s)]
*  It is chock full of wildly unpopular policy proposals. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=14.36s)]
*  You got everything from using a 19th century obscenity law to shut down all medication [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=19.3s)]
*  abortion and also maybe the mailing of all Earth control, to outright outlawing pornography [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=24.080000000000002s)]
*  and throwing people in prison over it, to weaponizing the Department of Justice to be [[00:00:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=29.7s)]
*  used explicitly as a kind of tool of vengeance for Donald Trump. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=34.04s)]
*  Now, Republicans realize that Project 2025 and all these ideas are wildly unpopular, [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=37.86s)]
*  or at least they're beginning to, which is why today Donald Trump is desperate to try [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=42.7s)]
*  to separate himself from it all. [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=46.84s)]
*  Trump does not want people to know about the entire vanguard of extremist weirdos around [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=49.58s)]
*  him and what their little plans are for when he governs. [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=54.34s)]
*  With the Project 2025 plans lying in plain sight, they are panicking in a comically preposterous [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=58.1s)]
*  and fraudulent way. [[00:01:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=63.6s)]
*  Donald Trump posting today, I like this, he knows nothing about Project 2025 and has no [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=64.8s)]
*  idea who is behind it. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=69.78s)]
*  Well, you could go to the website. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=71.46000000000001s)]
*  It's got them all listed there. [[00:01:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=73.1s)]
*  Here's the thing. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=74.42s)]
*  The group behind it all is the Heritage Foundation. [[00:01:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=75.42s)]
*  You see that their logo and the scrim behind him? [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=77.9s)]
*  We all know Trump spoke to them while he was president. [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=81.94s)]
*  President Paul Dans, a former senior aide in the Trump administration, is the director [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=84.8s)]
*  of Project 2025. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=88.17999999999999s)]
*  Ken Cuccinelli, the cooch, Trump's former acting deputy homeland security secretary, [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=89.92s)]
*  who aggressively pushed anti-immigrant policies, wrote a chapter in the manifesto. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=94.32s)]
*  John McEntee, Trump's one-time White House personnel director, a guy very close to him, [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=98.64s)]
*  around him all the time, is a senior advisor. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=102.88s)]
*  He's been doing some vetting of a personnel database to see who they're going to staff [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=105.12s)]
*  the government with. [[00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=109.44s)]
*  So if Trump has no idea who is behind it, he is far too senile to be allowed to continue [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=110.56s)]
*  his campaign, either that or he's lying. [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=115.32000000000001s)]
*  Amanda Marcotte is a senior politics writer at Salon, where she writes today, Project [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=118.48s)]
*  2025 may be backfiring on Trump. [[00:02:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=122.04s)]
*  Stuart Stevens worked as a political strategist on dozens of Republican campaigns. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=124.60000000000001s)]
*  He's now a senior advisor of the Lincoln Project. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=128.4s)]
*  And they join me now. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=130.54s)]
*  Amanda, why do you think it may be backfiring? [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=132.0s)]
*  Well, I think that, first of all, they gave it like a weird, sinister name, right? [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=134.84s)]
*  Project 2025. [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=141.0s)]
*  And so I think the original goal was to sort of put it out there and hope that the MAGA [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=142.4s)]
*  shock troops could hear it, and then like progressives might hear it and get all freaked [[00:02:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=147.16s)]
*  out and then they could laugh at how they're triggering the liberals. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=151.16s)]
*  But I don't think they thought that like ordinary people that might be swing voters in this [[00:02:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=154.68s)]
*  election would hear of it. [[00:02:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=158.92000000000002s)]
*  But I don't think that that's true anymore. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=161.0s)]
*  We're seeing some evidence that it's kind of breaking the blood-brain barrier and like [[00:02:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=163.24s)]
*  getting on the radar of people that don't pay super close attention to politics. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=167.28s)]
*  I had a conversation with a guy the other day on the street, actually, who said, I've [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=171.84s)]
*  been checked out of politics for four or five years. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=176.52s)]
*  What's been going on? [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=179.28s)]
*  Which is a great question. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=180.28s)]
*  I was like, where do I start? [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=181.28s)]
*  And also said, his only question, Stuart, his only question was, what's this Project [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=182.48s)]
*  2025 I keep hearing about? [[00:03:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=187.24s)]
*  Which suggests to me that it has, to Amanda's point, it has taken on a kind of virality [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=188.92000000000002s)]
*  out past the sort of circle of people that are avid news consumers. [[00:03:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=195.68s)]
*  Yeah, look, this is the day after July 4th. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=201.84s)]
*  If people don't know about Project 25 now, they're going to know come November, come [[00:03:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=206.48000000000002s)]
*  people start voting. [[00:03:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=210.6s)]
*  You know, part of what's happening here is there's a complete void of policy on the [[00:03:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=213.0s)]
*  Republican side. [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=218.32s)]
*  Yes. Yeah. [[00:03:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=219.32s)]
*  What is it? So of course, this is filling that. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=220.68s)]
*  You know, here's a serious question. [[00:03:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=223.64s)]
*  Is there any Republican running for reelection who is running an ad or talking about a bill [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=225.92s)]
*  that they actually voted for? [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=230.92s)]
*  I'm not aware of any. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=233.76s)]
*  They're out there talking about stuff like J.D. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=235.24s)]
*  Vance, about the benefits of the Infrastructure Act that he voted against. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=237.8s)]
*  What did the Republicans accomplish that they're now saying? [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=242.48s)]
*  Trust us. Put us back. [[00:04:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=245.2s)]
*  Put us in power. Give us more power and we'll deliver this. [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=247.12s)]
*  I don't know what this this bargain is that they get. [[00:04:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=250.44s)]
*  So you have Project 2025, which is basically an attack on the future. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=253.07999999999998s)]
*  This is some sort of effort to turn the clock back, which is what the Trump candidacy is [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=258.12s)]
*  about. I mean, let's not forget Donald Trump is against mandatory school vacations, not [[00:04:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=263.52s)]
*  for covid, but for everything. [[00:04:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=271.4s)]
*  So, you know, I mean, there may be a bunch of people out there that miss polio and whooping [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=273.56s)]
*  cough and measles, but I don't think there's many of them. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=277.76000000000005s)]
*  That this point about the sort of absence of a platform or policy agenda is so is so [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=281.52000000000004s)]
*  key. And I think, Amanda, there's a few things in operation here. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=286.24s)]
*  One is a sort of authoritarian cult around Trump, whatever he wants. [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=289.84000000000003s)]
*  Famously, in 2020, they just said we're not doing a platform. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=292.84000000000003s)]
*  But there's also some there's also some sort of feral intelligence to this, I think, from [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=297.16s)]
*  Trump's perspective, which is if you don't write anything down, then you don't have any [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=303.8s)]
*  positions. Right. So like, I keep bringing this up. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=307.16s)]
*  But like, what is Donald Trump's position on Gaza? [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=310.68s)]
*  You know, it's very hard to say. He doesn't really write it down. [[00:05:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=312.84000000000003s)]
*  They don't policy papers. He did say in the debate he wants to let Israel finish the [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=314.8s)]
*  job. Those are his words. [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=318.68s)]
*  I don't know what that means. You can intuit. [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=320.28000000000003s)]
*  But this is an example, Amanda, to me, to Stuart's point where it is all written down. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=322.52000000000004s)]
*  And that's why it was such a tell to me for Trump to try to run away from it. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=327.24s)]
*  Yeah, I think one of the goals of having an outside firm do this might have been exactly [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=331.76000000000005s)]
*  to make sure that there was distance between this and Trump. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=337.36s)]
*  But like you said, there's so many staffing people in common with his first administration. [[00:05:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=340.84000000000003s)]
*  And there's just so many connections. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=347.84000000000003s)]
*  It's hard to run away from. [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=349.24s)]
*  But I also think to the point about like kind of what like ordinary people that only have [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=350.44s)]
*  pay attention to politics, like they aren't going to be tuned into those kinds of things. [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=354.72s)]
*  They're not going to be tuned into those kind of fine distinctions for exactly that reason. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=360.88s)]
*  They're not paying enough attention. [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=365.28s)]
*  They just hear the name. [[00:06:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=366.96s)]
*  From a purely political practitioner standpoint, Stuart, I thought Trump coming out to try to [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=369.08s)]
*  distance himself and then a bunch of reporters writing it up as, you know, Trump torches [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=375.03999999999996s)]
*  heritage and Trump's campaign manager saying if you poke the berry, you get bit. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  By the way, in the post, he says, I wish them all the luck or whatever he said, like, go [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=384.08s)]
*  This to me is such a tell from a political standpoint that they are worried about this [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=389.24s)]
*  thing. They understand it's got traction. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=393.44s)]
*  Yeah, this is the policy equivalent of I didn't inhale. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=397.12s)]
*  It seemed sort of disingenuous and silly. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=401.24s)]
*  The better politics would be for them to actually have something that they're running on [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=405.84000000000003s)]
*  themselves. But, you know, the idea. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=409.28000000000003s)]
*  That's right. That's right. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=412.32000000000005s)]
*  They could they could say, look, we're not doing Project 2025. [[00:06:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=413.6s)]
*  Here's everything on the website of what we're going to do. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=417.32000000000005s)]
*  But of course, there is there is no such thing. [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=419.36s)]
*  Look, you know, most of the time when you walk into a presidential campaign, there's a [[00:07:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=422.24s)]
*  whole group of people over there and go like, who are they? [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=425.0s)]
*  They're Supreme Court clerks. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=427.6s)]
*  They're Rhodes Scholars. They're producing more paper than the Renaissance and these policy [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=428.76000000000005s)]
*  plans, you know, that they don't have those people in the Trump campaign. [[00:07:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=432.12s)]
*  Right. It's such a good point. [[00:07:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=435.08000000000004s)]
*  They ain't there. And, you know, they ain't there for a reason because Trump won't ever read [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=436.44000000000005s)]
*  this stuff and he doesn't care about policy. [[00:07:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=440.68s)]
*  So, you know, this is why this debate was such a lost opportunity for Donald Trump. [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=443.28s)]
*  He could have come out there and said, look, I've got these plans, roll out some sort of [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=448.08s)]
*  economic plan. He could have said, look, I've never been elected to office before. [[00:07:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=453.08s)]
*  I learned a lot when I was president. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=457.2s)]
*  I know it was a turbulent president. [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=458.71999999999997s)]
*  I'm going to be a better president next time. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=460.11999999999995s)]
*  He didn't do any of that. [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=462.44s)]
*  That person would have walked off stage a stronger candidate. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=463.79999999999995s)]
*  So, you know, I think for understandable reasons, there's been this focus on Biden. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=466.52s)]
*  But let me tell you, how many people do you think started that evening as a Biden voter [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=470.32s)]
*  ended up a Trump voter? [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=475.24s)]
*  I don't think very many. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=477.04s)]
*  No, the polling we have, in fact, bears that out. [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=479.40000000000003s)]
*  What it has shown is to the extent that the numbers have shifted, it's been people moving [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=481.92s)]
*  from Biden undecided as opposed to Biden to Trump. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=485.92s)]
*  That lead is essentially in all the polling we've seen subsequent to the debate has been [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=488.40000000000003s)]
*  that has been that kind of movement. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=492.92s)]
*  We'll see how much more traction this gives. [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=494.08000000000004s)]
*  So I also think it's a bit of a gift to the Biden campaign and to Democrats that they're [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=495.8s)]
*  denying it, because now you get to go back and be like, really, really? [[00:08:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=500.36s)]
*  You sure about that? You sure about that? [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=503.68s)]
*  That's why Amanda Marcotte, Steven Stevens. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d8uMKY_hhtY&t=504.72s)]
