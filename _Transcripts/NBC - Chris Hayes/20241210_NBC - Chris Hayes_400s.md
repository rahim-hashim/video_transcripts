# 'Positively Orwellian' Bombshell report reveals Trump DOJ spied on members of Congress
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 10, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM)
*  Today's report from the inspector general showed just how far Donald Trump's last administration [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=0.0s)]
*  went in targeting his perceived enemies. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=5.28s)]
*  And with his picks for the next administration, Donald Trump is assembling a whole new crew [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=8.08s)]
*  of people willing to do whatever he wants. [[00:00:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=12.040000000000001s)]
*  Senator Chris Murphy is a Democrat of Connecticut. [[00:00:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=15.700000000000001s)]
*  He joins me now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=17.82s)]
*  Senator, it's great to see you again. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=18.82s)]
*  Let me just get your thoughts on the news that we learned today about the Trump Justice [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=20.34s)]
*  the previous one secretly obtaining phone and text messages of 43 congressional staffers, [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=25.2s)]
*  two members of Congress, reporters. [[00:00:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=30.759999999999998s)]
*  What do you make of this blatant weaponization of the Justice Department? [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=33.519999999999996s)]
*  Yeah, it's an extraordinary story. [[00:00:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=37.16s)]
*  I mean, this is positively Orwellian. [[00:00:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=40.32s)]
*  Trump was going after the phone records of members of Congress, staff, Republicans and [[00:00:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=44.56s)]
*  Democrats, and then going to extraordinary lengths to try to hide it from public view, [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=48.72s)]
*  burying the records request. [[00:00:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=53.52s)]
*  Only now are we finding out the true extent of his attempt to try to target his political [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=56.0s)]
*  enemies and members of a protected branch of government. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=64.12s)]
*  And I think it just shows you what we're in store for. [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=69.88s)]
*  Since then, he has made no secret of the fact that if he's elected, which he was, he is [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=72.52000000000001s)]
*  to view his political opposition as the number one threat to the nation's security. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=78.42s)]
*  Of course, his opposition isn't a threat to the country, but it might be a threat to him. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=84.62s)]
*  And having done it once and now having installed a whole bunch of stooges in the Department [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=89.38s)]
*  of Justice and the FBI, I think you're likely to see a lot more of this really over the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=95.46000000000001s)]
*  top targeting of his political enemies. [[00:01:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=100.7s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=103.54s)]
*  What does that look like? [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=104.54s)]
*  Well, that was far broader than previously known. [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=105.58000000000001s)]
*  We're learning about it only almost four years after the fact. [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=108.02000000000001s)]
*  If this is what Trump was willing to sign off back then when we believed there were [[00:01:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=111.86000000000001s)]
*  adults in the room like the Bill Bars or the Jeff Sessions, what do you anticipate a more [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=117.2s)]
*  emboldened, more aggrieved Trump might do? [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=123.06s)]
*  Are there any preparations in place to prevent something like this from happening again? [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=127.54s)]
*  Well, listen, we can't completely imagine what he will do. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=133.14s)]
*  But Cash Patel, who is his nominee to head the FBI, has made it very clear that he is [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=137.01999999999998s)]
*  going to prosecute and persecute anyone who he believes has stood in the way of Donald [[00:02:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=143.45999999999998s)]
*  Trump's political agenda. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=151.1s)]
*  One of the things he says he will do is prosecute people who tried to uphold Joe Biden's win [[00:02:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=153.22s)]
*  in 2020. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=160.11999999999998s)]
*  In other words, if you didn't try to rig the election for Donald Trump, you may soon be [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=161.94s)]
*  investigated by the FBI and perhaps prosecuted by the Department of Justice. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=167.02s)]
*  That's how serious this can be. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=173.22s)]
*  Now, we could hope that an independent judiciary would back us up, but there are a whole bunch [[00:02:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=174.86s)]
*  of Trump sycophants that were put on the bench by President Trump during his first term who [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=180.62s)]
*  may not rule in favor of the Constitution and an individual's right to free speech. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=186.74s)]
*  So I think this is a really scary moment. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=192.86s)]
*  But we have the power to fight back against Cash Patel's nomination, to fight back against [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=194.82000000000002s)]
*  Pam Bondi's nomination, to expose for the American public what they are going to do [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=199.3s)]
*  if these people who are loyal to Donald Trump, not the rule of law, get into office. [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=205.34s)]
*  So people still have power right now because if we expose them ahead of time, if we make [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=209.58s)]
*  it very clear what they're going to do, it'll make it a little bit harder for them to get [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=214.1s)]
*  away with it. [[00:03:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=216.98s)]
*  And speaking of exposing people and certainly double standards and hypocrisy, let me turn [[00:03:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=217.98s)]
*  to another pick ahead of Senate confirmation hearings. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=221.94s)]
*  That is a former Fox host, Pete Hexeth, who is up for a very important position. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=225.14s)]
*  Defense secretary has been dealing with the repercussions of sexual assault allegations, [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=230.1s)]
*  unpopular opinions about the military. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=233.9s)]
*  Watch this. [[00:03:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=236.1s)]
*  I'm straight up just saying we should not have women in combat roles. [[00:03:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=237.1s)]
*  It hasn't made us more effective, hasn't made us more lethal, has made fighting more complicated. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=241.9s)]
*  Our institutions don't have to incentivize that in places where traditionally, not traditionally, [[00:04:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=246.54s)]
*  over human history, men in those positions are more capable. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=253.5s)]
*  I also want an opportunity here to clarify comments that have been misconstrued that [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=257.38s)]
*  I somehow don't support women in the military. [[00:04:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=261.78000000000003s)]
*  Some of our greatest warriors, our best warriors out there are women. [[00:04:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=265.74s)]
*  So he's either lying to the American people when he was a host or he's lying to them now [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=269.42s)]
*  as a nominee. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=274.02000000000004s)]
*  I'm just curious your thoughts on this. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=275.82s)]
*  How are those lies interpreted by the Senate during the confirmation process? [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=277.58000000000004s)]
*  Well, it speaks to a broader trend in these picks. [[00:04:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=282.02000000000004s)]
*  President Trump is picking TV personalities, people that he watches on TV, excuse me, who [[00:04:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=288.38s)]
*  are primarily showmen. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=294.3s)]
*  What you're seeing is that the act that exists on TV may or may not be true. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=297.5s)]
*  There may be some things that Pete Hegseth or Dr. Oz say on TV that they believe. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=303.17999999999995s)]
*  There may be other things that they say simply because it thinks that it will get them ratings. [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=308.17999999999995s)]
*  The bigger problem with Hegseth is this extraordinary litany of abuses against women with alcohol. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=313.73999999999995s)]
*  You combine that with a complete lack of experience in running a bureaucracy this big, combined [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=323.34s)]
*  with backwards views about women in combat, about the role of Muslims in society. [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=330.82s)]
*  It just seems like a recipe for disaster. [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=335.85999999999996s)]
*  I just think it's extraordinary that there aren't going to be two or three or four Republicans [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=339.58s)]
*  who will go to President-elect Trump and say there has got to be somebody else without [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=345.02s)]
*  this history of abuse, without these backwards misogynist views that could be the secretary [[00:05:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=350.86s)]
*  of defense. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=358.06s)]
*  If there aren't three or four Republicans who are willing to stand up to somebody like [[00:05:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=359.42s)]
*  Hegseth, then it just shows you that that party is truly a cult of personality and that [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=362.65999999999997s)]
*  Donald Trump has total command and control over every single Republican senator and congressman. [[00:06:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=368.78s)]
*  All right, Senator Chris Murphy of Connecticut. [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=374.74s)]
*  Senator, always a pleasure. [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=377.02s)]
*  Thank you so much for your time, sir. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UZ3DFtq5ODM&t=378.53999999999996s)]
