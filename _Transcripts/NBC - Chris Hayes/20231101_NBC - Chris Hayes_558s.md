# DeSantis denies wearing height-boosting boots as campaign stumbles
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 01, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM)
*  Mike Pence announced that he is dropping out of the 2024 Republican primary over the week. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=0.0s)]
*  And usually that surprise announcement, I mean, he sort of sprung it on people, would have been huge news. [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=5.2s)]
*  There just has not been that much national interest in that primary contest. [[00:00:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=10.0s)]
*  And that's because Donald Trump currently holds a enormous, dramatically, in the polls. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=14.0s)]
*  He is the big red line at the top. [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=18.8s)]
*  His second closest opponent, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis Greenline, finds his lead getting smaller and smaller. [[00:00:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=20.8s)]
*  And this failure to gain any momentum has caused some problems for the candidate that some in the past have called short Trump. [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=28.0s)]
*  That attention is where all the attention on Ron DeSantis has been lately. [[00:00:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=34.0s)]
*  Not on his positions, but on the interesting boots he's been awkwardly strutting around in. [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=38.0s)]
*  The internet has become obsessed with these mystery boots and the theory they might contain lifts in the heel to make Ron look taller. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=43.0s)]
*  Shoe experts have weighed in on the weirdly long sideshow Bob style toe box situation that maybe is because there aren't any toes in there. [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=49.0s)]
*  Maybe because the foot is back up on a stilt in the back like stiletto high heels inside his manly man cowboy boots. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=57.0s)]
*  It's all speculation, of course, not the type of thing anyone is seriously focused on. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=64.0s)]
*  What they're trying to say with this is that in your boots you have heels. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=71.0s)]
*  No, no, no, those are just standard off the rack. [[00:01:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=76.0s)]
*  Lucchese. [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=79.0s)]
*  How tall are you? [[00:01:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=80.0s)]
*  How tall are you, Governor? [[00:01:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=81.0s)]
*  Five eleven. [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=82.0s)]
*  Five eleven. [[00:01:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=83.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=84.0s)]
*  Why don't you wear tennis shoes and dress shoes? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=85.0s)]
*  I do wear tennis shoes when I work out. [[00:01:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=88.0s)]
*  Yeah, you do. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=90.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=91.0s)]
*  I got a gift for you. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=92.0s)]
*  I'd love for you to wear. [[00:01:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=93.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=94.0s)]
*  I shop at Fergamo. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=95.0s)]
*  Okay. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=97.0s)]
*  And I got. [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=98.0s)]
*  I don't accept gifts. [[00:01:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=101.0s)]
*  I can't accept it. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=102.0s)]
*  I totally get it. [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=103.0s)]
*  I'm sorry. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=104.0s)]
*  Do you think Ron DeSantis thought that was going to be his fate when he got into this race, when he was the world-beater, when he had just romped to re-election, when he was the guy who was going to take on Trump? [[00:01:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=105.0s)]
*  Do you think that's where he thought he'd be ended up in that guy's podcast getting Ferragamos? [[00:01:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=117.0s)]
*  To add injury to insult, a new poll from NBC News and the Des Moines Minister shows DeSantis now tied with a rising Nikki Haley. [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=121.0s)]
*  Jamel Bowie is an opinion columnist for the New York Times. [[00:02:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=130.0s)]
*  Tim Miller was communications director for the Jeb Bush 2016 campaign. [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=133.0s)]
*  Now, right at large for the bulwark, both join me now. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=136.0s)]
*  I, Tim, as a veteran of one of these primaries, I saw, like, I think I'm not projecting, but like a flicker of like deep existential dread and despair flashing through Ron DeSantis' eyes as he finds himself on some dude's podcast talking about his shoes, like, on the sort of like freak show fringes of a race that he was supposed to be at the center of. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=140.0s)]
*  Yeah, it kind of always looks like he's about to snap, to be honest. It's kind of his face, which has been one of his problems in the primary. But I also noticed some dread. I do have to say I don't have a ton of sympathy. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=169.0s)]
*  I really don't have any sympathy for somebody that signed up to be Ron DeSantis' communication director, my old job. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=181.0s)]
*  But I do have just a little bit of like professional empathy for the idea that had I put my candidate onto a podcast that was totally meaningless and then on the podcast, they got lectured about how they're supposedly wearing high heel shoes. [[00:03:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=186.0s)]
*  I wouldn't have wanted to be in the car with the candidate after. I would be taking an Uber home. So that's pretty embarrassing. [[00:03:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=201.0s)]
*  And I mean, I think this mostly just speaks to how relevant the campaign is. And obviously, there are more serious issues. The fact that he's out there saying that 11th graders can't talk about their gay family members, but he can wear high heels. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=208.0s)]
*  There seems to be some inconsistencies there. I do think the former is probably more important. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=220.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think what is striking to me, I have the feeling now about this primary, which, again, I guess I tried to keep myself with an open mind as we went into this, Jamel. [[00:03:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=224.0s)]
*  Like, I don't know. The future is unwritten. I keep telling myself all the time, like, I keep reminding myself of what I thought was going to be my year in February of 2020, which constantly keeps me honest about how much I can extrapolate the future from the past. [[00:03:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=233.0s)]
*  But what is your understanding of why we have ended up here in which a possibly competitive primary has been this what you're seeing? [[00:04:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=247.0s)]
*  Okay. You know, I think it's it was not quite inevitable, but close to inevitable as soon as the Republican Party collectively decided in February of 2021 that Trump could just skate past January 6. [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=258.0s)]
*  No problem. Yeah, no one was really going to contest that. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=274.0s)]
*  That as soon as that decision was made first, Trump's narrative of the election, cemented in stone. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=278.0s)]
*  I did not lose. It was illegitimate. I actually am the victor. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=285.0s)]
*  Every other Republican has to defer to that narrative. You'll remember last year when Ron the Sandist seemed like he was riding high. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=290.0s)]
*  He wouldn't even really challenge that at all, right? No one would really challenge that narrative whatsoever. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=297.0s)]
*  I think that's the challenge here. This unchallengeable narrative about how Trump actually won the election and Trump is running again. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=303.0s)]
*  So it's like, of course, he's going to be ahead because he's still the uncontested leader of the Republican Party. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=310.0s)]
*  There's no one willing to say, you know, in the presidential field, this guy actually lost. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=317.0s)]
*  This guy's a huge loser. We're not going to go with him. [[00:05:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=322.0s)]
*  All the other candidates, rather than trying to distinguish themselves in a meaningful way from Trump, are all pitching themselves for the most part. [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=326.0s)]
*  This is variations on the feed. I'm like Trump, but I'm like more competent. [[00:05:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=334.0s)]
*  I'm like Trump, but I'm like a 37 year old Marty Wen kid. [[00:05:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=339.0s)]
*  Like, you know, just various variations on who Donald Trump is. [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=343.0s)]
*  Thank you. Thank you. [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=347.0s)]
*  Thank you. Together. My expectation really has been, of course, Trump is going to be the nominee. [[00:05:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=353.0s)]
*  Like, there's no there's no way in which it's shaping out that it would be anything else. [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=358.0s)]
*  Yeah. And I think that, you know, that point about that, that was a decisive moment, Tim, that the sort of that narrative about the loss, right? [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=364.0s)]
*  For a bunch of different reasons in terms of the political expediency of like, you're a loser who lost. [[00:06:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=371.0s)]
*  Like, generally, parties don't like take the guy that just lost the election and then be like, yes, you're our path to victory. [[00:06:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=376.0s)]
*  So there's that. There's also just the sort of moral consequences of that as well. [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=382.0s)]
*  But I think you see that in the Mike Pence, you know, you know, if the idea was Trump ism without January 6th, right? [[00:06:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=387.0s)]
*  Like, there's a plausible case for Mike Pence, who was like there as a loyal soldier every step of the way, but for the coup. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=397.0s)]
*  And the fact that he can't even make it into Iowa says something about how doomed that is. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=403.0s)]
*  Yeah, for sure. I almost entirely agree with Jamal. [[00:06:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=408.0s)]
*  It was maybe one slight exception, but that was the moment in February. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=412.0s)]
*  Not only politically, but the narrative that he set in, but also practically, you know, there's senators in this race, right? [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=416.0s)]
*  That could have voted to convict him and would have and that would have eliminated their top competitor. [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=421.0s)]
*  Generally speaking, if you're a guy like Tim Scott, if you're running a serious race and you're at the bottom and you have a chance to cast a vote that could eliminate your top competitor, that would have seemed like a good idea morally and strategically. [[00:07:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=426.0s)]
*  But they all didn't do that. So that was part of it. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=436.0s)]
*  And I do think that there was maybe a second window after the midterms when DeSantis could have made this case really strongly. [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=439.0s)]
*  Right. And I do. And you saw it in the polls. The numbers were there. This guy's a loser. We saw it again. We tried again. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=446.0s)]
*  I do think there's one more window after in November 22. As for Pence, just really quick, him and Mike Johnson is the best example of this. [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=451.0s)]
*  And these are the two saying they literally the same guys at the same positions are both religious conservatives. [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=459.0s)]
*  They're both like one of them becomes a speaker. The other drops out. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=463.0s)]
*  The only difference between them is January 6th. And that shows you how January 6th is so central to the Republican psyche. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=466.0s)]
*  Yeah. And the end, I think also, I mean, that there's going to have to be Jamal. [[00:07:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=473.0s)]
*  I think the other thing driving this is that people think that Trump is a possible contender to be president and the polling backs him up. [[00:07:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=477.0s)]
*  I do think everyone has forgotten a little bit of what a trial national trial is going to mean the politics of. [[00:08:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=484.0s)]
*  And I continue to think that's underpriced. What do you think? [[00:08:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=493.0s)]
*  I think that's probably right. Like a unprecedented trial of a president during a former president, sorry, during an election year. [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=498.0s)]
*  Seems like the kind of thing that's going to be consequential, especially since what we know about Trump is that it's whenever he is really in the public eye, whenever he's really loud and present, that people don't want anything to do with him. [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=506.0s)]
*  Notably right now, he's sort of faded to the background. And when he fades to the background and you see him, you see this in his polling during his presidency. [[00:08:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=518.0s)]
*  When he fades to the background, people become a little more tolerant of him. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=525.0s)]
*  So we'll have to see how things look when he's back in the foreground. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=529.0s)]
*  Yeah, I think that's exactly right. Jamal Bowie and Tim Miller. Great to have you both. Thank you. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=532.0s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K5q_3nUbzJM&t=555.0s)]
