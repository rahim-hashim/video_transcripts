# Democrats avert a 'Trump-Musk shutdown' just hours ahead of deadline
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 20, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. Here's where we are. With the holidays looming, [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=0.0s)]
*  Republicans created a massive government crisis out of nothing. They then begged Democrats to [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=4.72s)]
*  bail them out, which the Democrats did tonight, and a costly shutdown appears to be averted at [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=9.36s)]
*  the 11th hour. With the passage of a bill to fund the government until March in the House, [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=14.24s)]
*  thanks to near unanimous support from Democrats just hours before the federal government was [[00:00:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=18.8s)]
*  set to run out of funding. We're still waiting on the Senate, though that's expected. This absurd [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=22.96s)]
*  flirtation with disaster was completely preventable, but it became necessary after [[00:00:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=28.48s)]
*  Republican leadership scuttled a robust bipartisan funding bill that had been hammered out between [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=32.88s)]
*  the parties over months. They got orders to oppose it from the big guy, the wealthy showman [[00:00:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=38.0s)]
*  who is the de facto leader of the Republican party, Elon Musk, the world's richest man who [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=43.52s)]
*  used his Twitter platform to blast the government funding bill dozens of times. After Musk declared [[00:00:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=48.64s)]
*  war on the bill, then the actual president-elect, that guy named Donald Trump, followed suit, [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=54.32s)]
*  saying, yeah, yeah, also I don't like it. And he wanted the funding bill to also do away with the [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=59.76s)]
*  federal debt ceiling. Okay. What then unfolded over the last 24, 36 hours was predictable chaos, [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=65.36s)]
*  you could call it. Republican House Speaker Mike Johnson suddenly struggling to keep the government [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=72.72s)]
*  open and keep his own leadership job, while the world's richest man tweeted about how a government [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=77.03999999999999s)]
*  shutdown wouldn't be that bad. In fact, it would be good. An absurd situation that Democrats [[00:01:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=82.0s)]
*  hammered in floor debates tonight. At the behest of the world's richest man, who no one voted for, [[00:01:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=86.8s)]
*  the United States Congress has been thrown into pandemonium. It leads you to the question of [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=95.84s)]
*  who is in charge. I thought that there was a Republican majority in this body. [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=102.96000000000001s)]
*  Not a President Musk majority. Still, given the last minute nature of the bill and the need for [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=112.16s)]
*  suspension of the rules, a two thirds vote, Democrats swooped in to vote for the bill that [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=123.52s)]
*  passed tonight. It was in some ways very similar to the original bill that Musk killed. So it keeps [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=127.2s)]
*  the government open until mid-March. It keeps the disaster aid and emergency relief for farmers [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=132.32s)]
*  flowing, which were aspects of the bill. But crucially, and we're going to get into this tonight, [[00:02:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=137.04s)]
*  it did not and does not include the original bill's $190 million for pediatric cancer research. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=142.56s)]
*  Notably, it also did not include what Trump said he wanted most, what he called for, what he said [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=149.6s)]
*  he would support primaries over and end the debt ceiling. But the bill and Speaker Johnson got the [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=155.28s)]
*  seal of approval from the guy who really pulls the strings. Quote, the Speaker did a good job [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=162.96s)]
*  here given the circumstances. It went from a bill that weighed pounds to a bill that weighed ounces. [[00:02:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=167.36s)]
*  We now know, of course, that the weight of a bill is the most important part of it. [[00:02:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=171.52s)]
*  And what were those circumstances, Elon, the conditions you caused? [[00:02:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=175.28s)]
*  Even so, after the vote, Speaker Johnson assured reporters that both of his bosses [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=179.04000000000002s)]
*  were pleased with the outcome. I was in constant contact with President Trump throughout this [[00:03:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=182.88s)]
*  process, spoke with him most recently about 45 minutes ago. He knew exactly what we were doing [[00:03:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=189.04000000000002s)]
*  and why. And this is a good outcome for the country. I think he certainly is happy about [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=194.64000000000001s)]
*  this outcome as well. Elon Musk and I talked to within about an hour ago, and we talked about the [[00:03:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=199.60000000000002s)]
*  extraordinary challenges of this job. And I said, hey, you want to be Speaker of the House? I don't [[00:03:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=205.68s)]
*  know. He said, this may be the hardest job in the world. I think it is. But we're going to get [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=209.20000000000002s)]
*  through this. I talked to Trump. I talked to Musk. At one level, it's just the latest and starkest [[00:03:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=214.08s)]
*  reminder Republicans have not been capable of smoothly governing for years. It's exactly what [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=220.64000000000001s)]
*  they've been doing during this Congress, the most dysfunctional Congress basically in anyone's [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=225.36s)]
*  memory. It's the one that you remember started in January 2023 with the longest, most contentious [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=229.92000000000002s)]
*  vote for a House speaker since the lead up to the Civil War. It took four days and 15 rounds of [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=234.8s)]
*  voting for Kevin McCarthy to realize his lifestream of becoming Speaker. And then he only lasted a [[00:04:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=240.0s)]
*  few months before being ousted by a handful of his own colleagues. It was led by now former [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=244.32s)]
*  Congressman Matt Gaetz. We're awaiting the release of his possible ethics report about allegations of [[00:04:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=249.12s)]
*  sexual impropriety. Anyway, something McCarthy says wasn't about policy disagreements, but [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=254.16s)]
*  something else altogether. And I'll give you the truth why I'm not Speaker. It's because one person, [[00:04:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=258.32s)]
*  a member of Congress, wanted me to stop an ethics complaint because he slept with a 17 year old. [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=264.56s)]
*  An ethics complaint that started before I ever became Speaker and that's illegal and I'm not [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=269.36s)]
*  going to get in the middle. This is still that Republican party. This shutdown mass is part and [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=274.16s)]
*  parcel of their signature incompetence. Now there is one new twist where House Republicans used to [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=280.16s)]
*  take their marching orders directly from Donald Trump. This version of Trump is now 78 years old. [[00:04:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=285.92s)]
*  He's entering office as the oldest man ever to enter the office in history. He seems less [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=291.44s)]
*  energetic than ever. And there appears to be a new, more powerful party boss in town in the form [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=297.12s)]
*  of the world's richest man who's decades younger, owns an influential platform, the unelected [[00:05:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=302.24s)]
*  co-president Elon Musk. Now this is a guy who clearly has very little understanding of how [[00:05:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=308.4s)]
*  Congress and the Constitution work, but whatever Musk is up to, it is only possible because of [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=313.76s)]
*  the Republican party's longstanding incompetence in fighting self-involvement, inability to [[00:05:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=318.48s)]
*  articulate a cohesive vision of the public good. Throughout the campaign this year, [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=323.12s)]
*  their incompetence was papered over, forgotten, didn't really punch through. And there was this [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=330.8s)]
*  gathering idea that MAGA politicians had learned that they'd gotten smarter and more sophisticated. [[00:05:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=337.2s)]
*  They had a playbook for governing this time. They had Project 2025. And a big part of that is true. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=341.28000000000003s)]
*  It continues to be really ominous that this new administration has developed in these four years [[00:05:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=345.2s)]
*  what seem to be pretty detailed plans for MAST deportations using the tools of law enforcement [[00:05:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=351.36s)]
*  against political rivals and opponents. But over this last few days, the first test of their [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=356.48s)]
*  competence right here. And it doesn't look like these people spent a lot of time practicing and [[00:06:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=361.12s)]
*  getting their reps in so that they could be game ready when they came back off the bench. [[00:06:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=364.40000000000003s)]
*  Sahil Kapoor is a senior national reporter for NBC News and he joins us live from Capitol Hill. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=369.36s)]
*  In the end, Sahil, it seems to me like the ultimate thing that always brings these to a resolution, [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=374.96000000000004s)]
*  which is that everyone wants to get out of town for the holidays, was what ended things here. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=380.08s)]
*  Yeah, that's definitely a part of it, Chris. It was quite a turnaround over just two days from [[00:06:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=385.12s)]
*  President-elect Trump and Elon Musk blowing up that earlier deal to the House of Representatives, [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=390.0s)]
*  ultimately passing a slimmed down version of it. And it's very notable that the House passage of [[00:06:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=395.12s)]
*  the bill only came after Speaker Johnson went through several iterations. Finally on Plan D, [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=400.15999999999997s)]
*  he agreed to strip out the single biggest demand that Donald Trump has made, kind of in the 11th [[00:06:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=405.84s)]
*  hour, this curveball that he threw, saying that he wanted this Congress to get the debt limit [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=410.4s)]
*  off his plate so he could come into office and pursue his agenda, including major tax cuts. [[00:06:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=415.03999999999996s)]
*  Democrats said no way they were going to do that. They saw that as them kind of rolling out the red [[00:06:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=419.84s)]
*  carpet, just as he wants to pass a big tax cut that they argue will primarily benefit the wealthy. [[00:07:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=424.79999999999995s)]
*  But in the end, you know, Trump threatened to primary what he said. Any Republican who [[00:07:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=429.67999999999995s)]
*  voted for a bill without a debt limit extension, and 170 Republicans voted for it, [[00:07:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=434.72s)]
*  one of the takeaways there is that Republicans have an easier time saying no to Trump when they [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=438.96000000000004s)]
*  do collective action. You know, when it's not just a few of them that he can go after individually [[00:07:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=443.12s)]
*  and target them. When it's 170 of them, he's not going to come after them and primary them. [[00:07:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=446.48s)]
*  Now, Chris, this also creates a massive legislative traffic jam in the early part of [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=451.04s)]
*  Donald Trump's presidency next year. They have pushed the deadline to March 14th. That means [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=455.36s)]
*  they're going to have to come right back to the table, cut another deal with Democrats because [[00:07:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=459.68s)]
*  they can't pass a bill like this without Democrats even next year when they have full [[00:07:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=462.72s)]
*  control of Congress. There's also the debt limit deadline that they have to deal with now next [[00:07:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=467.04s)]
*  year. It's not dealt with in this one. Major party line bills on immigration, energy, and tax [[00:07:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=470.88000000000005s)]
*  cuts that Republicans are trying to pursue. In addition to confirming President Trump's [[00:07:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=478.08000000000004s)]
*  cabinet nominees and personnel through the Senate, that is a lot to do. And this wafer [[00:08:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=482.24s)]
*  thin Republican margin in the House, the first thing they've got to do is elect the speaker. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=486.24s)]
*  Mike Johnson is going to run for reelection. He expects to become speaker again. But when they [[00:08:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=490.48s)]
*  take office, when they take their seats, Chris, on January 3rd, the margin is going to be 219 to [[00:08:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=494.32s)]
*  215 because Matt Gaetz is not going to take his seat. That means Speaker Johnson can lose one [[00:08:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=498.96000000000004s)]
*  Republican, just one, a second defection, to prevent him from getting the speaker's job and [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=503.12s)]
*  throw the entire Republican agenda into disarray. So that's where they are now. He's got two weeks [[00:08:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=508.08000000000004s)]
*  to make sure he can get the votes and kick off what is likely to be, even in the best case scenario, [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=513.2s)]
*  a very, very rocky next year for President-elect Trump's agenda. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=517.76s)]
*  Yeah, you made this point, which is great, that on Wednesday Trump threatened to primary [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=522.56s)]
*  any Republican who votes for a clean continuing resolution without a debt limit extension. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=525.84s)]
*  That was his threat. His demand was, I don't know what Elon's doing, he's doing his thing, [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=529.68s)]
*  but my demand is you do the debt ceiling. Bupkis. He lost the vote on the debt ceiling at 38 [[00:08:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=534.16s)]
*  defections and then this passes today with 170 votes. As you say, Friday, 170 Republicans vote [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=540.88s)]
*  for a clean continuing resolution without a debt limit extension. The bill passed overwhelmingly. [[00:09:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=545.52s)]
*  Whereas the spending Musk was focused on did get cut out, it seems like one of them got what they [[00:09:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=549.52s)]
*  wanted and one didn't. Sahil Kapoor. Thank you and I'm glad that you can also go home for the holidays. [[00:09:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BDcDKTKxC_o&t=554.24s)]
