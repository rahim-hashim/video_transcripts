# Pelosi ‘guarantees’ Trump will enact national abortion ban if he wins
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [June 26, 2024](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38)
*  Tomorrow's presidential debate, abortion rights, will obviously be a big topic. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=0.0s)]
*  The thing to keep in mind as you watch is that whatever Donald Trump says in the debate [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  and whatever any Republican says, the fact is that to its core, the Republican Party [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=9.24s)]
*  is committed to banning access to abortion for all women in this country everywhere. [[00:00:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=14.52s)]
*  It is what the strongest, most activated members of that party want and what they're going [[00:00:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=19.64s)]
*  to do. [[00:00:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=24.0s)]
*  Take a look at what just happened in South Carolina. [[00:00:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=25.560000000000002s)]
*  There were three Republican state senators there who had stood in the way of an incredibly [[00:00:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=27.2s)]
*  draconian abortion ban. [[00:00:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=31.36s)]
*  And then when they did that, they were all primaried. [[00:00:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=33.84s)]
*  And all three of those women lost their primary races to anti-abortion men last night. [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=36.6s)]
*  That is the way that gravity pulls in today's Republican Party. [[00:00:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=43.0s)]
*  Every single Republican, from state representatives all the way up to Donald Trump, understands [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=46.18s)]
*  that. [[00:00:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=50.239999999999995s)]
*  I'm joined now by House Speaker Emerita Nancy Pelosi, Congresswoman from California. [[00:00:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=51.239999999999995s)]
*  Good to have you on, Speaker. [[00:00:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=55.519999999999996s)]
*  My pleasure. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=56.84s)]
*  Thank you. [[00:00:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=57.84s)]
*  You're someone who spent a lifetime in politics from the time that your father was the mayor [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=58.84s)]
*  of Baltimore. [[00:01:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=64.0s)]
*  So you understand the way that political incentives work. [[00:01:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=65.0s)]
*  When you look at what has happened in the Republican Party, when you look at something [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=69.76s)]
*  like last night where these three state senators had stood in the way of this ban, they get [[00:01:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=72.4s)]
*  primaried, they lose, what does that do to the way that Republicans understand what they [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=77.80000000000001s)]
*  have to do and what they will do about abortion, no matter what messaging they're going to [[00:01:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=84.67999999999999s)]
*  say on, say, a debate stage. [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=90.03999999999999s)]
*  Well, thank you very much for your question. [[00:01:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=92.24s)]
*  It's good to be here as we observe the two-year anniversary of the jobs decision. [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=95.44s)]
*  And I can tell you that this week we've had a drumbeat across America of events all over [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=102.36s)]
*  talking about how we have to reverse that decision with law by winning the election [[00:01:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=108.32s)]
*  and enshrining Roe v. Wade and the law of the land. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=114.75999999999999s)]
*  And also how people see it as a kitchen table issue. [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=118.96s)]
*  This is an economic issue for families, the size and timing of their families or if they're [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=124.1s)]
*  going to have a family. [[00:02:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=129.72s)]
*  It's a freedom issue. [[00:02:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=131.6s)]
*  It's a democracy issue. [[00:02:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=132.72s)]
*  It's about freedom for women to make their own choices. [[00:02:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=134.6s)]
*  So when you see that election in North Carolina last night, it was heartbreaking. [[00:02:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=138.64s)]
*  Those women were courageous. [[00:02:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=144.16s)]
*  They went out and said what they believed and that was rejected by the voters. [[00:02:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=146.26s)]
*  But we have to make sure that the voters know. [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=151.64s)]
*  And one thing they will know is the difference between Joe Biden and the former president [[00:02:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=155.04s)]
*  of the United States. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=160.7s)]
*  If the other guy wins, there will be no question there will be a national abortion ban in our [[00:02:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=162.9s)]
*  country. [[00:02:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=169.5s)]
*  I say that very sadly as a Roman Catholic, as a person who had five children and six [[00:02:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=170.5s)]
*  years and one week. [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=176.34s)]
*  Very wonderful. [[00:02:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=178.78s)]
*  A joy to us. [[00:02:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=179.78s)]
*  That was our choice. [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=181.56s)]
*  Other people should have their choice. [[00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=183.1s)]
*  So this tomorrow night you'll see a split screen on the subject of respect for women. [[00:03:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=185.86s)]
*  You'll see a split screen on their economic life. [[00:03:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=192.7s)]
*  And the list goes on that we can talk about, but to stick with jobs for a moment. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=196.72s)]
*  One of the things that we were observing this week as we had our drumbeat across America [[00:03:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=203.14s)]
*  was access to contraception. [[00:03:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=208.42s)]
*  How many Republicans do you think in the House of Representatives voted for a woman to have [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=211.56s)]
*  the right to contraception? [[00:03:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=218.17999999999998s)]
*  Eight. [[00:03:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=221.22s)]
*  195 Republicans voted no. [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=222.22s)]
*  Women do not have a right to contraception. [[00:03:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=227.98s)]
*  We're not talking abortion. [[00:03:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=230.85999999999999s)]
*  We're talking contraception. [[00:03:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=232.5s)]
*  So this is about they believe in, they don't believe in birth control, but they do believe [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=234.9s)]
*  in controlling women. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=241.74s)]
*  So women have to recognize and that as I say that election last night told me that not [[00:04:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=243.85999999999999s)]
*  enough people were paying sufficient attention to what it was at stake and what it meant [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=248.76s)]
*  to those women, to their families, for their children and the rest, for them to have an [[00:04:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=254.32s)]
*  economic issue, a freedom issue, a personal choice issue just pulled away from them in [[00:04:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=260.36s)]
*  that way. [[00:04:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=267.44s)]
*  And if he wins, well, it can't, I mean, it cannot happen. [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=268.9s)]
*  Well, I mean, it can happen. [[00:04:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=273.08s)]
*  But understand this. [[00:04:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=274.08s)]
*  I hate to tell you, we went through it once. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=275.08s)]
*  It doesn't. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=277.44s)]
*  It makes sure it doesn't. [[00:04:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=278.44s)]
*  For a lot of reasons. [[00:04:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=279.71999999999997s)]
*  One of them is that there will be an abortion ban in our country. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=281.24s)]
*  That's a guarantee. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=286.52s)]
*  Let me ask you, let me ask you a follow-up. [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=287.52s)]
*  By the way, I'm still, my mind is still running the math on five children in six years in [[00:04:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=289.03999999999996s)]
*  one week, which is, I guess I knew, I knew as an abstract fact about your life, but wow. [[00:04:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=292.24s)]
*  That's incredible. [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=300.47999999999996s)]
*  There are two things they say. [[00:05:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=301.88s)]
*  One is Trump says no national ban. [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=303.84000000000003s)]
*  Well, I'm not going to do a national ban. [[00:05:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=306.16s)]
*  And two, and this I think gets to something you're saying here, and I was just mentioning [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=309.6s)]
*  it before, when you poll folks, there's maybe 20 percent of voters who don't even realize [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=313.32s)]
*  that it was Donald Trump's Supreme Court that took away Roe v. Wade. [[00:05:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=317.36s)]
*  I mean, there's something like 15 to 20 percent of voters that think Joe Biden is responsible [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=320.24s)]
*  for the overturning of Roe. [[00:05:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=324.44s)]
*  Well, that's so interesting because he takes great pride in the fact that he packed the [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=326.84000000000003s)]
*  court against the women. [[00:05:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=333.0s)]
*  And Mitch McConnell was his accomplice in all of that, packed the court against women, [[00:05:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=335.6s)]
*  going out there, taking great pride of it in certain audiences and in other audiences [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=343.56s)]
*  saying I'm not going to do a ban. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=348.84000000000003s)]
*  And then there are other things that are contingent upon this. [[00:05:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=352.08000000000004s)]
*  For example, he says, when you see the split screen tomorrow in favor of a woman with respect [[00:05:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=355.71999999999997s)]
*  for her ability to make her choices, on the other side, a ban, a ban on contraception, [[00:06:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=362.16s)]
*  a ban on terminating a pregnancy, a ban on your free choice and your liberty. [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=369.64s)]
*  And then you see things that go with it. [[00:06:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=375.96s)]
*  This is a health issue. [[00:06:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=378.58s)]
*  And I quote him, and it's crude, but he is. [[00:06:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=380.71999999999997s)]
*  Abortion, excuse me, the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare sucks. [[00:06:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=384.28s)]
*  No, it doesn't suck. [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=390.24s)]
*  It cures. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=392.36s)]
*  And he says, oh, if you need, have preexisting conditions, I'm going to take care of you. [[00:06:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=393.86s)]
*  No, you wouldn't. [[00:06:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=398.68s)]
*  The bill he put forth didn't even have anything about preexisting conditions in it. [[00:06:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=399.96s)]
*  And if it did, it would be so expensive that, forget about it, forget about it. [[00:06:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=404.44s)]
*  So then you look at something else. [[00:06:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=409.47999999999996s)]
*  People are concerned about inflation. [[00:06:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=410.96s)]
*  Sixteen Nobel laureates came out this week and said that if, what's his name, we're [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=414.0s)]
*  elected president, with his fiscal policies, inflation would just increase enormously in [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=420.96s)]
*  our country. [[00:07:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=430.71999999999997s)]
*  And you have Joe Biden on the other side of that screen, leading the world in reducing [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=431.71999999999997s)]
*  inflation in our country. [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=436.96s)]
*  So if you talk about any subject, you can talk about it. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=438.6s)]
*  If you're young people care so much about another scientific issue, climate, saving [[00:07:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=441.8s)]
*  the planet. [[00:07:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=448.48s)]
*  Bozo went on, sat down at the table with fossil fuel industry executives and said, give me [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=451.0s)]
*  a billion dollars for my campaign so I can reverse what they have done with the IRA to [[00:07:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=458.76s)]
*  save the planet. [[00:07:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=466.6s)]
*  Joe Biden is there, has been, he was the first person in the Congress of the United States, [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=468.96s)]
*  way back in the 80s, even before I was there, to introduce a resolution calling for the [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=474.36s)]
*  Senate to address the climate crisis issue. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=481.03999999999996s)]
*  Let me ask you this question. [[00:08:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=485.44s)]
*  I think most folks watching this agree about the sharpness of these contrasts. [[00:08:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=486.96s)]
*  Certainly on these policy areas, I think they're correct, right? [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=492.24s)]
*  There's real, real choices about health care, abortion rights, the climate and big oil, [[00:08:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=495.28000000000003s)]
*  even on inflation. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=501.52s)]
*  I think, you know, that why, given how sharp is the contrast, what do you tell yourself [[00:08:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=502.52s)]
*  when people ask you, as they ask me, how is it so close? [[00:08:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=507.92s)]
*  What's your answer to that? [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=511.08s)]
*  Well, I don't think it's going to be so close. [[00:08:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=512.08s)]
*  And don't forget, we didn't mention guns. [[00:08:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=515.24s)]
*  There are other issues where the split screen has a very sharp contrast. [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=517.08s)]
*  We don't agonize about who says what. [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=525.1600000000001s)]
*  We organize. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=528.0400000000001s)]
*  We own the ground. [[00:08:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=529.0400000000001s)]
*  We get out our vote. [[00:08:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=530.4200000000001s)]
*  Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States again. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=532.0s)]
*  He will be. [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=535.8000000000001s)]
*  And Kamala Harris, the vice president. [[00:08:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=537.84s)]
*  We're very proud of that. [[00:09:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=540.24s)]
*  And we are organized. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=542.32s)]
*  I'm going all over the country. [[00:09:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=543.32s)]
*  I'm a former chair of the party. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=544.84s)]
*  You know, I came up into all of this being a grassroots organizer to get out the vote [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=546.24s)]
*  on the political side, to get out the vote. [[00:09:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=551.88s)]
*  I can smell a good campaign or not. [[00:09:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=555.4s)]
*  And I'm telling you, the scent is there. [[00:09:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=559.88s)]
*  People are ready. [[00:09:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=562.64s)]
*  Now, just for example, in the election of 2022, you will recall that the pundits, wherever [[00:09:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=563.64s)]
*  they are, were saying we were going to lose 30 or 40 seats. [[00:09:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=571.04s)]
*  Correct. [[00:09:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=574.68s)]
*  They didn't know what they were talking about. [[00:09:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=575.68s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:09:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=577.44s)]
*  They didn't know what they were. [[00:09:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=578.44s)]
*  Was it or a red wave or some such thing? [[00:09:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=580.44s)]
*  They had a little eyedropper. [[00:09:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=582.9200000000001s)]
*  We lost five. [[00:09:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=584.8000000000001s)]
*  We'll get them back. [[00:09:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=585.8000000000001s)]
*  Hakeem Jeffries will be the speaker of the House. [[00:09:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=586.8000000000001s)]
*  Chuck will be the leader of the majority in the Senate. [[00:09:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=589.8800000000001s)]
*  And Joe Biden will be president of the United States. [[00:09:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=593.36s)]
*  But back to 22, I kept saying, why are they saying that? [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=597.12s)]
*  And even Democrats were going on TV saying, oh, she's got it all wrong. [[00:10:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=601.2s)]
*  She's saying a woman's right to choose. [[00:10:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=605.36s)]
*  Jobs is a big deal in this election. [[00:10:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=607.8399999999999s)]
*  Yes, it was. [[00:10:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=609.88s)]
*  They said it's all in the rearview mirror. [[00:10:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=611.4s)]
*  Women don't care that much. [[00:10:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=613.3599999999999s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=614.5999999999999s)]
*  Yes, they do. [[00:10:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=615.9599999999999s)]
*  So that's one issue. [[00:10:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=617.7199999999999s)]
*  And that's a very important issue because it's a freedom issue. [[00:10:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=619.9599999999999s)]
*  It's personal. [[00:10:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=623.3199999999999s)]
*  It's health. [[00:10:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=624.3199999999999s)]
*  It's freedom. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=625.3199999999999s)]
*  It's economic. [[00:10:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=626.3199999999999s)]
*  And we still have seen in special election after special election that sort of driving [[00:10:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=627.3199999999999s)]
*  energy that you talk about in 2022 has showed up at the polls in special election after [[00:10:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=631.9599999999999s)]
*  special election. Speaker, America, Nancy Pelosi. [[00:10:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=636.56s)]
*  Always a pleasure to have you on. [[00:10:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=639.0799999999999s)]
*  Thank you very much for your time tonight. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQn9e31RL38&t=640.1999999999999s)]
