# 'Bully': McCarthy accused of ‘kidney punching’ colleague as GOP senator tries to fight witness
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [November 14, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys)
*  Good evening from New York. I'm Chris Hayes. It was a chaotic and oddly violent [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=0.0s)]
*  day on Capitol Hill, where Republicans' dysfunction, stunts, and anger are [[00:00:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=4.64s)]
*  becoming more and more extreme. Now, ironically, this all happened amidst what [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=8.76s)]
*  should be a real success for House Republicans. Their new speaker, Mike [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=13.16s)]
*  Johnson-Louisiana, just managed to pass a continuing resolution funding the [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=17.2s)]
*  government until early next year. That avoids a looming shutdown. That's good, [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=22.0s)]
*  you think. But crucially, more Democrats voted for that measure than members of [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=26.88s)]
*  Johnson's own party. As Jake Sherman of Punchbowl News put it, Democrats saved [[00:00:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=32.28s)]
*  him. Dangerous territory for Republican speaker, C. McCarthy, comma Kevin. Mike [[00:00:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=36.8s)]
*  Johnson learned pretty quickly the lesson that the only way to keep the [[00:00:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=42.32s)]
*  government functioning, something we've been saying throughout, right, is to [[00:00:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=46.22s)]
*  basically ignore part of his own caucus and to work with Democrats. And that [[00:00:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=49.64s)]
*  decision today and the kind of oddly anticlimactic vote in Congress along [[00:00:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=54.08s)]
*  the lines we all knew it would happen, that may have something to do with the [[00:00:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=58.92s)]
*  rage that emerged all over Capitol Hill today in an environment that Speaker [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=62.16s)]
*  Johnson himself described as a, quote, pressure cooker. And the first and most [[00:01:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=66.6s)]
*  notable incident involved Mike Johnson's predecessor. Remember that guy? That's [[00:01:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=70.88s)]
*  the former Speaker of the House, Kevin McCarthy, turfed out over a month ago. [[00:01:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=74.84s)]
*  This morning, in clear view of at least one report, McCarthy appears to have [[00:01:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=79.56s)]
*  assaulted a member of his own GOP conference. NPR congressional [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=85.12s)]
*  correspondent, Claudia Grisales, posted this firsthand account, quote, have never [[00:01:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=90.08s)]
*  seen this on Capitol Hill. While talking, Congressman Tim Burchette after the [[00:01:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=95.12s)]
*  Republican conference meeting, former Speaker McCarthy walked by with his [[00:01:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=99.84s)]
*  detail and McCarthy shoved Burchette. Burchette launched, lunged towards me. I [[00:01:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=103.98s)]
*  thought it was a joke. It was not. And a chase ensued. Grisales also recorded the [[00:01:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=110.22s)]
*  audio of the interaction, which I'm going to play you in full. Before I do [[00:01:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=115.38000000000001s)]
*  that, a warning. All of the clips, low lights that are going to play you from [[00:01:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=118.62s)]
*  the Hill today are just so, so cringy. You're going to want to turn away at [[00:02:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=123.22s)]
*  first, but it's also just such a wild window into what's going on there. I [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=128.98000000000002s)]
*  think you will not want to take your eyes and ears off them. So this is what [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=133.18s)]
*  happened when Kevin McCarthy exited that meeting and encountered Tim Burchette of [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=136.86s)]
*  Tennessee in the hallway. [[00:02:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=140.58s)]
*  Sorry, Kevin didn't mean to help. Why'd you elbow me in the back, Kevin? [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=151.38s)]
*  Hey, Kevin, you got any guts? [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=156.5s)]
*  Jerk. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=160.34s)]
*  Has he done that before? No. [[00:02:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=161.66000000000003s)]
*  That's a new move. [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=165.46s)]
*  You got no guts. You did so. They sat there and the reporter said it right [[00:03:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=181.26000000000002s)]
*  there. What kind of chicken move is that? You're, you're pathetic, man. You are [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=184.70000000000002s)]
*  so pathetic. [[00:03:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=190.1s)]
*  Jerk. You need security, Kevin. [[00:03:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=196.5s)]
*  Anyway, [[00:03:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=204.9s)]
*  short while later, Bursch it. Bursch it explained that what happened in more [[00:03:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=207.5s)]
*  detail, telling reporters he believed the assault was intentional. [[00:03:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=211.98s)]
*  Yeah, I was standing in the hall, New York and Kevin McCarthy walked by, elbowed [[00:03:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=215.34s)]
*  me in the kidneys as he walked by. And I kind of caught me off guard and never [[00:03:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=222.42000000000002s)]
*  get shot, shot in the kidneys. It's a little different than anywhere else. And [[00:03:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=229.26000000000002s)]
*  so I moved forward. I felt forward. You felt it was on purpose and not an [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=234.06s)]
*  accident? Oh, it was 100% on purpose, ma'am. What a chance. It's 435. Members [[00:03:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=239.42000000000002s)]
*  paid up his photos against the one he did publicly called me out. He didn't [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=244.82s)]
*  see any cameras. He didn't think about his attention. Yeah, he's not the body [[00:04:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=252.14000000000001s)]
*  of an NPR was paying attention. Now, for his part, McCarthy denied the whole [[00:04:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=255.22s)]
*  thing, claiming it was a tight area where they may have bumped shoulders by [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=259.38s)]
*  accident. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=262.74s)]
*  Did you elbow him? No, I did not elbow him. No, I would not elbow him. I would [[00:04:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=264.62s)]
*  not hit him in a kidney. Hc five. You're all down there, right? Not a very big [[00:04:28](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=268.7s)]
*  hallway. So I'm walking out. You could talk to Bruce Westman because I [[00:04:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=272.62s)]
*  actually called him after you guys reported seven. Did I hit somebody? [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=276.42s)]
*  Bruce Westman. I walk it out. I guess a reporter was interviewing Berchard or [[00:04:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=280.1s)]
*  something. I guess our shoulders here because Berchard runs up to me after I [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=284.74s)]
*  didn't know what he was talking about. Some reporters asked me. I did not run [[00:04:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=287.54s)]
*  and hit the guy. I did not kidney punch him. I did not shoot anything like that. [[00:04:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=290.82s)]
*  You didn't show up. No, but reporters are witnesses that it looked like you. [[00:04:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=294.06s)]
*  There was plenty of room for you to walk and that you intentionally hit him. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=297.5s)]
*  There is. Okay, not a place. Show me a reporter who saw that. Ask called [[00:05:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=300.66s)]
*  Bruce Westerman. Couple of us Bruce Westerman. No, I did not go up. If I if [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=304.66s)]
*  I would hit somebody, they would know I think he said he knew. He said he was [[00:05:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=309.42s)]
*  in pain that you hit him so hard. Now, three said, Okay, now that explanation [[00:05:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=314.02000000000004s)]
*  was met with quite a bit of skepticism, especially in light of the recent [[00:05:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=320.54s)]
*  accusation by former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. The [[00:05:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=323.18s)]
*  McCarthy shoved him on two occasions. I just take a second to think about how [[00:05:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=326.78s)]
*  insane this is. Kevin McCarthy is alleged to and in view of a reporter [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=331.53999999999996s)]
*  appears to have like elbowed in the kidney. A colleague he was mad at. That [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=336.38s)]
*  is a wild thing to do. A grown man in a workplace. Can you would you? Can you [[00:05:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=343.17999999999995s)]
*  imagine doing that in your place of work anywhere? Congressman Matt Gates of [[00:05:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=349.7s)]
*  Florida never wanted to see a news cycle go by without joining it. Filed this [[00:05:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=354.70000000000005s)]
*  request for a House Ethics Committee investigation into kidney punch gate [[00:05:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=358.3s)]
*  today. Then on the other side of Capitol Hill, we're not done here. We almost saw [[00:06:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=363.90000000000003s)]
*  another confrontation come to blows. This one took place in the middle of a [[00:06:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=369.38000000000005s)]
*  health, education, labor and pension committee hearing when Republican [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=373.3s)]
*  Senator Mark Wayne Mullen of Oklahoma brought up brought up his on life beef [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=377.06s)]
*  with the witness, the president of Teamsters Labor Union, Sean O'Brien, [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=382.18s)]
*  Chairman Bernie Sanders had to step in. [[00:06:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=386.66s)]
*  Pretends like he's self made. What a clown fraud always has been always will [[00:06:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=389.94s)]
*  be quit the tough guy act and the Senate hearings. You know where to find me any [[00:06:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=396.82s)]
*  place, anytime cowboy. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=403.06s)]
*  Sir, this is a time. This is a place you want to run your mouth. We can be too [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=407.06s)]
*  consenting adults. We can finish it here. Okay, that's fine. Perfect. You want [[00:06:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=411.06s)]
*  to do it now? I'd love to do it right now. Let's stand your butt up then you [[00:06:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=414.7s)]
*  stand your bottom. Oh, hold on. Stop it. [[00:06:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=417.58s)]
*  No, no, sit down. Okay. You know, you're a United States Senator. Okay, sit [[00:07:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=421.86s)]
*  down, please. [[00:07:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=427.26s)]
*  You're a United States Senator. Sit down. Sit down. You're nice. A senator. [[00:07:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=428.94s)]
*  That senator, by the way, former mixed martial arts fighter, refused to back [[00:07:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=436.18s)]
*  down. He kept trying to set a place in time for the physical altercation [[00:07:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=439.62s)]
*  between the two men. You said anytime, any place. What's your question? [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=444.7s)]
*  Except the challenge. What challenge? You said anytime, any place. I'm accepting [[00:07:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=449.86s)]
*  yours. So once you come challenge, what challenge you talk April 30th, how [[00:07:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=454.38s)]
*  about we do it for charity at the smoking guns in Tulsa, Oklahoma? No, [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=457.66s)]
*  we're not going to be talking about physical confrontations here. You want [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=461.78000000000003s)]
*  to fight me? What do you say by anytime, any place? Let's have coffee, discuss [[00:07:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=464.9s)]
*  our differences. Yeah, that's right. Exactly. All right. Well, let's sit on [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=468.54s)]
*  have coffee. Let's do it. I'd love to. It's funny how you're backing out. Okay, [[00:07:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=471.70000000000005s)]
*  I don't back on anything. You did. You're the one. You're a 100. Senator should [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=475.14000000000004s)]
*  be the most influential people in this country making changes. You're focused [[00:07:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=479.18s)]
*  on. Okay, you're focused on. That's not even relevant. You're an embarrassed [[00:08:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=483.06s)]
*  when he was asked about the wisdom of using violence to solve the dispute. [[00:08:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=488.86s)]
*  Mullen pointed to the long history of fighting in the nation's capital. [[00:08:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=492.42s)]
*  Yeah, but what about I mean, just the idea that fighting as a way to solve a [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=496.34s)]
*  problem? Is that kind of are you concerned that that's the way the [[00:08:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=499.78s)]
*  conversation is happening here in Capitol Hill? People's been fighting [[00:08:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=503.65999999999997s)]
*  for a long time. I mean, go back to 1800s. They said canings. It was legal [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=506.73999999999995s)]
*  to do duels. If you have a difference, you have a difference. I didn't start [[00:08:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=510.41999999999996s)]
*  it. I didn't tweet it him. I didn't go after him. I have no beef with a guy. I [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=513.9399999999999s)]
*  mean, I don't even know the last time I've gotten a street fight. I used to [[00:08:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=517.5799999999999s)]
*  get paid to fight. I'm not looking at what I have. What victory is it for me [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=520.5s)]
*  to beat up O'Brien? That would be a shock, right? But he said it, and I [[00:08:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=524.7s)]
*  just simply responded. If he wants to call it off and we just go have a cup [[00:08:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=531.6600000000001s)]
*  of coffee, fine. Let's have a cup of coffee. I have no part. It's not [[00:08:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=535.26s)]
*  personal to me. He just challenged me and I accepted the challenge. To be [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=538.1800000000001s)]
*  clear, Mullen is not wrong about the history of violence on the House floor. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=542.46s)]
*  There's an incredible book about this came out a few years ago, but the [[00:09:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xH-dkEg7Wys&t=546.38s)]
