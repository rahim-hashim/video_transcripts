# Watch All In with Chris Hayes Highlights: May 10
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [May 11, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM)
*  Rachel Maddow's fantastic podcast, Rachel Maddow Presents Ultra, just won the 2023 Hillman Prize for broadcast journalism last night. [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=0.0s)]
*  The podcast explores the long forgotten, seditious conspiracy in the lead up to World War II, the plot to overthrow the US government. [[00:00:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=9.0s)]
*  Rachel is, of course, the host of MSNBC's Rachel Maddow Show, and she joins me now. [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=17.0s)]
*  Rachel, congratulations on the well deserved award. I was walking with a journalist I know today who was just apropos of nothing raving about Ultra, and we just talked about it for about a fully 15 minutes about how great it was and how relevant it is precisely because the seditious conspiracy trial that appears in your podcast ends up not being successful, unlike the three the government has managed to win so far. [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=22.0s)]
*  It is remarkable. I mean, so ultra weirdly the timing on it was strange. We launched ultra the podcast right when the seditious, seditious conspiracy trial started against the Oath Keepers. [[00:00:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=47.0s)]
*  We finished launching the podcast. The final episode came out when the first verdict came out in the first seditious conspiracy trial. [[00:00:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=59.0s)]
*  You could have knocked me over with a feather if you had told me before the conclusion of those trials that we would have three successful sedition prosecutions by the Justice Department around January 6th. [[00:01:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=67.0s)]
*  I mean, sedition is really, really hard to prove and for good reason. You know, I mean, right as Americans, it is it is it is legal for us to say terrible things and believe in legal. [[00:01:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=77.0s)]
*  Exactly. And believe terrible things and even to advocate for politically terrible things. We can be awful people who want to awful things to happen. [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=89.0s)]
*  We have those rights under the Constitution and God bless us for it. But that means a sedition prosecution is is is all but impossible. [[00:01:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=97.0s)]
*  I mean, in 2012 in Michigan, right in in 1988 at the Fort Smith Sedition trial, which is a big white power trial in 1944, which was the one in ultra of all the Nazis and fascists. [[00:01:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=104.0s)]
*  All the sedition trials almost always fail. And yet the Justice Department has in for multiple two different pro Trump right wing paramilitary groups. [[00:01:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=114.0s)]
*  Multiple trials has been able to get conviction after conviction after conviction. [[00:02:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=124.0s)]
*  And that is important about the work of the Justice Department. I think it's important also in terms of the work of what Donald Trump is trying to do and how. [[00:02:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=128.0s)]
*  And I think it is going to change what's possible for him in terms of what he's trying to do to the country going forward. [[00:02:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=136.0s)]
*  Well, I want to I want to follow up on that. But but first, as you were saying that something struck me, that's important. [[00:02:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=142.0s)]
*  The part of the experience the last eight years is a sort of feeling of gaslighting and sort of fabric of reality being torn apart and a lot of what about ism when you just say simple state, simple and clear and obvious facts. [[00:02:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=149.0s)]
*  And one of the things I think that's been really interesting about those three seditious conspiracy trials and then the verdict from the jury in the civil trial for sexual abuse and defamation rendered against Donald Trump this week is that, you know, there's no like referees in our lives. [[00:02:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=160.0s)]
*  There's no teacher. There's no principle you appeal to. Like, there's no one to be like, is this true or false? [[00:02:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=176.0s)]
*  It's like what we have at the highest level of process is that you go before a jury and you make arguments and you introduce evidence. [[00:03:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=180.0s)]
*  These people debate and then they come back and they say, like, this is the way it is. [[00:03:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=188.0s)]
*  This is what happened. And this is the way it is. And there is something reassuring in both of these cases to have some grounding amidst the madness of the gaslighting and all that that that that I have personally found important in a sort of civic sense. [[00:03:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=193.0s)]
*  Yes. And it's it's why in the Trump era of American right wing politics, people like you and I and lots of people watching us right now feel like we've become fake lawyers. [[00:03:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=209.0s)]
*  Right. Like none of you are lawyers. Like we both know lots of lawyers. You're married to a very, very good one. [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=220.0s)]
*  But like we've all had to become sort of minor experts in criminal and to a lesser degree civil procedure because the courts are for all their failings. [[00:03:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=225.0s)]
*  They are a place in which you must provide facts to back up your assertions. [[00:03:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=235.0s)]
*  They are tested in a rigorous adversarial process. [[00:04:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=241.0s)]
*  There is a judge and often a jury who are further going to test those assertions. [[00:04:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=244.0s)]
*  And you can't just say stuff without being held accountable for the consequences of those words. [[00:04:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=248.0s)]
*  And that's not true in public life the way that it is true in the courtroom. [[00:04:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=253.0s)]
*  And so it means the courts have been really, really important and the courts can't do everything. [[00:04:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=257.0s)]
*  But when they've shown that they can do really difficult stuff like sedition prosecutions, I think it does matter. [[00:04:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=262.0s)]
*  Right. I mean, if you are running an authoritarian movement, you are trying to replace democracy. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=269.0s)]
*  And part of the way that you do that is by using force. [[00:04:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=275.0s)]
*  Use force to try to get what you want to stop the certification of the vote, say. [[00:04:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=277.0s)]
*  But it's mostly to intimidate normal people out of participating in normal politics. [[00:04:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=281.0s)]
*  It's to make the political environment scary, violent, intimidating, overwhelming, make it feel like it's not for you. [[00:04:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=286.0s)]
*  So that space can instead be flooded by the authoritarian force. [[00:04:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=293.0s)]
*  These seditious conspiracy convictions at multiple trials make it harder for Trump to organize that. [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=297.0s)]
*  And it doesn't mean that he goes to jail for it. [[00:05:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=304.0s)]
*  The violence is not by him. It's for him. [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=307.0s)]
*  And we don't know how that's going to be prosecuted if at all. [[00:05:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=310.0s)]
*  We'll see what Jack Smith has to say. [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=313.0s)]
*  But it does take away an important tool for his overall project. [[00:05:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=315.0s)]
*  Well, and this is this is why I actually think, you know, I don't have access to the facts that that Jack Smith's investigators do. [[00:05:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=319.0s)]
*  We do have access to a lot of facts. There's a January 6th Committee report. [[00:05:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=327.0s)]
*  There's like the day of January 6th. You and I were covering it live on television. [[00:05:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=331.0s)]
*  This was not totally done in secret. [[00:05:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=336.0s)]
*  The man got in front of the circle and said, like, march with me down the Capitol. [[00:05:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=338.0s)]
*  And I honestly feel at this point him facing trial for his involvement. [[00:05:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=342.0s)]
*  I don't know what specifically which which of the parts of the criminal code there were four recommendations January 6th. [[00:05:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=348.0s)]
*  It's like the highest level of process that we could, again, produce. [[00:05:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=356.0s)]
*  Right. It's like, let's have it out as almost existential democratic question. [[00:06:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=360.0s)]
*  Like, did this man do this thing in in the one place that we could have? [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=365.0s)]
*  You know, we have laws of evidence. We have a jury of all that stuff. [[00:06:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=370.0s)]
*  It feels necessary civically to me that if it doesn't happen, doesn't happen. [[00:06:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=373.0s)]
*  But that's, I think, why I want it, not because I want him to go to jail, not because I want the catharsis, not because because for a civic reasons, [[00:06:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=377.0s)]
*  that's the thing we can do to your point about where these disputes end up about what are the facts of the matter. [[00:06:23](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=383.0s)]
*  Who did what? Are they blameworthy? [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=390.0s)]
*  Yes. And getting the facts about what happened right is still an ongoing process. [[00:06:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=392.0s)]
*  I mean, I know you're going to talk about Senator Tuberville with Jamal Bowie later on. [[00:06:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=397.0s)]
*  I'm really looking forward to hearing that. [[00:06:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=401.0s)]
*  I mean, part of what Senator Tuberville said in that interview where he said that the Biden administration shouldn't be trying to run white nationalists out of the military. [[00:06:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=403.0s)]
*  Part of what he said was that it was, you know, I think his phrase is something like there were 100 people who came in through doors that ought to have been locked. [[00:06:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=412.0s)]
*  As a matter of fact, and that's what went wrong on January 6. [[00:07:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=420.0s)]
*  I mean, he was there. That was his first day at work. [[00:07:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=423.0s)]
*  And he was he's he's still trying to sell this this fiction of what happened there. And that's important. [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=425.0s)]
*  But I I think you're what your sort of words of caution about like, don't do this for catharsis. [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=431.0s)]
*  Don't do this because this is like an ejector button in terms of this problem on the American right is really important. [[00:07:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=438.0s)]
*  I mean, bottom line here, let's say Donald Trump is convicted of something that, you know, like Stuart Rhodes puts him in jail for 25 years, whatever it is, like whatever the worst thing is that you can imagine that the criminal justice system can do to him. [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=444.0s)]
*  None of that would disqualify him from running for president. [[00:07:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=457.0s)]
*  You can run for president from prison. [[00:07:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=460.0s)]
*  Arguably, you can win the presidential election from prison and then try to pardon yourself. [[00:07:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=463.0s)]
*  And with this Supreme Court, who's to say he wouldn't get away with it? [[00:07:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=469.0s)]
*  There's no eject button for solving this. [[00:07:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=472.0s)]
*  It is about accountability and we hope it is political accountability and people souring on this idea. [[00:07:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=475.0s)]
*  But the truth is a prerequisite and taking away the tools that he can use where other people commit other people commit crimes on his behalf. [[00:08:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=481.0s)]
*  That helps. But it all has to be done at once. [[00:08:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=489.0s)]
*  Yeah, the Eugene Debs tested the first part of that constitutionally running from president. [[00:08:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=491.0s)]
*  He didn't test the second because he didn't he didn't win on the Socialist Party line. [[00:08:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=496.0s)]
*  So that remains a sort of a question mark. [[00:08:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=501.0s)]
*  You just mentioned a hundred percent agree. [[00:08:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=504.0s)]
*  It was a great thing about Ultra, too, of just like the sort of different parts of what we call civil society, right? [[00:08:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=506.0s)]
*  The law isn't something there's no civil bullet. [[00:08:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=511.0s)]
*  There's no panacea like for what makes a democracy work. [[00:08:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=513.0s)]
*  It's sort of endless toil and an effort by citizens to keep a democracy democracy. [[00:08:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=516.0s)]
*  The law is one component, but not the only one. [[00:08:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=520.0s)]
*  And I mentioned Eugene Carroll before. [[00:08:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=522.0s)]
*  But, you know, to me, this is a perfect example, right? [[00:08:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=525.0s)]
*  It's not like the Eugene Carroll verdict comes back and it's like, well, that's it. [[00:08:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=528.0s)]
*  He's done. You know, like probably means nothing. [[00:08:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=532.0s)]
*  Republican primaries voters. [[00:08:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=536.0s)]
*  And yet, but it still really matters that that happened. [[00:08:58](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=538.0s)]
*  And I haven't I'm just curious. [[00:09:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=542.0s)]
*  I've gotten a chance to talk to you since that verdict came down. [[00:09:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=544.0s)]
*  What your reaction was to it? [[00:09:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=547.0s)]
*  Well, I'll just tell you, I mean, first of all, I just think like when the the history of this era is written, [[00:09:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=550.0s)]
*  there are going to now be multiple chapters about Robbie Kaplan, a lawyer, given I mean, just in terms of the the the lawyering here and the advocacy here and what Robbie what else Robbie Kaplan has done within the past 10 years. [[00:09:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=558.0s)]
*  Like it's just it's it's going to be an important part of this moment in U.S. history. [[00:09:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=572.0s)]
*  This part of it. But I do think that you're right about the pain and the the the the trial, for lack of a better term, that Eugene Carroll went through here in order to relive this, be attacked for it, put herself out there, go through this entire process, go through that incredibly difficult adversarial process with Mr. [[00:09:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=576.0s)]
*  The point of it was to be heard, to have her claims tested in a way that is factually based and evidentiary based under a fair process that is transparent and everybody can see and to get the truth known. [[00:09:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=597.0s)]
*  And that is the fundamental basis of moving forward in a democracy that requires us to move to behave constructively and to live in a shared reality. [[00:10:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=614.0s)]
*  And her bravery and putting herself through that did something for the country in terms of establishing a truth there that, yeah, you can spit at it and you can pretend it didn't happen. [[00:10:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=625.0s)]
*  But all fair minded people recognize that it did and will know that that jury did its job. [[00:10:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=635.0s)]
*  And that is that is a service to the country in a way that she paid for personally. [[00:10:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=640.0s)]
*  And I think it's I think it's it's it's sad that it had to be so painful. [[00:10:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=646.0s)]
*  And I think it is commendable in terms of I think what is a patriotic impulse behind it. [[00:10:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=650.0s)]
*  In the face of glaring evidence like the ideology of the mass shooter in Texas, the far right has refused to admit that extremist views fuel violence and mass killings. [[00:10:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=655.0s)]
*  White nationalism in their telling is just another point of view and ideology that's just as legitimate as any other. [[00:11:06](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=666.0s)]
*  And that view is echoed apparently by Senator Tommy Tuberville, an Alabama Republican who sits on the Armed Services Committee in a recent radio interview as he complains about Pentagon efforts to keep extremists out of the military. [[00:11:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=671.0s)]
*  We are losing in the military so fast our readiness in terms of recruitment. [[00:11:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=686.0s)]
*  And why? I can tell you why. Because the Democrats are attacking our military. [[00:11:33](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=693.0s)]
*  So we need to get out the white extremists, the white nationalist people that don't don't believe in our agenda as as Joe Biden agenda. [[00:11:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=698.0s)]
*  They're destroying it. You mentioned the Biden administration trying to prevent white nationalist from being in the military. [[00:11:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=706.0s)]
*  Do you believe they should allow white nationalists in the military? [[00:11:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=714.0s)]
*  Well, they call them that I call them Americans. [[00:11:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=719.0s)]
*  I call them Americans. Today, Tuberville's office attempted to do a little cleanup, trying to clarify the center was just, quote, being skeptical of the notion that there are white nationalists in the military, not that he believes they should be in the military. [[00:12:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=722.0s)]
*  Even though, as you just heard, the center didn't really say that. [[00:12:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=736.0s)]
*  Jamal Bowie is an opinion columnist in New York Times. His most recent column, which is fantastic, is titled The Gun-Filled America is a World of Fear and Alienation. [[00:12:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=740.0s)]
*  And he joins me now. Jamal, it's great to have you here on studio. [[00:12:27](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=747.0s)]
*  Thank you for having me. Let's start with the Tuberville comments, which you could charitably try to say that he doesn't believe there are white nationalists in the military. [[00:12:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=750.0s)]
*  But even if you charitably extend them that, like, that's clearly false as well. [[00:12:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=759.0s)]
*  He, I mean, it's comments he's clearly saying that if there are white nationalists in the military, they should be allowed to be there. [[00:12:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=764.0s)]
*  They are just as entitled to be there as anyone else. [[00:12:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=771.0s)]
*  And the clear answer to that, beyond just the moral answer that you can't have white nationalists in an army that's supposed to represent a military, that's supposed to represent an integrated democratic society, but that that stuff is actually harmful for unit cohesion. [[00:12:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=776.0s)]
*  There are there are people in the military, many of them. [[00:13:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=792.0s)]
*  There are practical reasons why you cannot have those sorts of people openly in the military. [[00:13:15](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=795.0s)]
*  And so the idea that it is somehow anti-military or harming America's readiness to try to remove white nationalists from the U.S. [[00:13:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=802.0s)]
*  military is not just sort of I think wrong in its face for moral reasons, but for a practical reason. [[00:13:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=811.0s)]
*  It is actually the correct approach is to remove them if you can find them and they're identifiable. [[00:13:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=817.0s)]
*  There was this narrative that played out in the aftermath of the Texas, the Allen, Texas shooting. [[00:13:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=823.0s)]
*  And I'm sure you saw this speaking of white nationalists after some research by the folks at Bellingcat who were very good at sort of open source research. [[00:13:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=829.0s)]
*  They found a social media profile for the individual who is said to be the shooter. [[00:14:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=840.0s)]
*  And it was clear that he was essentially a Nazi, called himself a white supremacist. [[00:14:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=845.0s)]
*  He had apparently Nazi tattoos. [[00:14:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=849.0s)]
*  There was this effort on the right to to rebut this, that it was fabricated or a Psyop. [[00:14:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=857.0s)]
*  In fact, even people like there you go, there's the Nazi tattoos that were found on his social media profile. [[00:14:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=865.0s)]
*  Those are pretty darn clear. [[00:14:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=871.0s)]
*  Even though it was just obviously it seemed obviously like this was true. [[00:14:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=874.0s)]
*  Even Elon Musk got in on it saying this is either a Psyop or really weird. [[00:14:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=878.0s)]
*  And I'm just curious what you thought about this deny this attempt to so strenuously denial, deny a thing where it's like, what's it to you? [[00:14:43](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=883.0s)]
*  Right. What is your investment? [[00:14:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=891.0s)]
*  In this story that it not be a Nazi who shot these people up? [[00:14:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=893.0s)]
*  I've been struggling with this as well because I want to be charitable. [[00:14:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=897.0s)]
*  Right. You don't want to just assume that your ideological opponents or people you disagree with are just like sympathetic in any way to this sort of thing. [[00:15:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=901.0s)]
*  But the refusal to just outright say, yes, that guy was a Nazi and that's not surprising that a person with that horrible ideology did something horrible. [[00:15:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=910.0s)]
*  I think the most charitable way you can think about it is that there are people who are so strenuously committed to the idea of basically unlimited gun ownership that the fact the fact that it does allow someone like an avowed neo-Nazi to accumulate weapons and then use them. [[00:15:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=919.0s)]
*  That is sort of discredited. [[00:15:37](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=937.0s)]
*  Right. Like it begins to when you begin to ask the question, well, who exactly is a law-abiding American? [[00:15:39](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=939.0s)]
*  And it can be a neo-Nazi until the moment they decide they're not going to be law-abiding anymore. [[00:15:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=946.0s)]
*  And it's because people in favor of gun regulation are constantly making the point. [[00:15:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=952.0s)]
*  You cannot know when that moment's going to be. [[00:15:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=957.0s)]
*  So you have to keep these kinds of weapons out of the hands of people. [[00:16:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=960.0s)]
*  And the reality of the shooter in this case is a threat to those who want to push back against that notion. [[00:16:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=963.0s)]
*  You wrote this great column and it tracks with something I've been thinking about a lot more, which is that it's always been clear to me that American gun, lack of gun regulation and the fact that we have so many guns more than basically anywhere on Earth is horrible for the consequences. [[00:16:10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=970.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:16:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=985.0s)]
*  But I think it's a sort of fundamental existential question for our society. [[00:16:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=986.0s)]
*  I've started to believe that more and more. [[00:16:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=990.0s)]
*  And you articulate this beautifully in this column. [[00:16:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=992.0s)]
*  You say a world with a lot of guns is a world of fear and alienation where people live in a state of heightened awareness, even anxiety, which might be the point for conservatives who want that world, who want in a sense that polite society because what will survive our hierarchy and force and the power to make others bend your will. [[00:16:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=994.0s)]
*  And if they refuse, if they insist on the right to live free of fear, well, that's what the guns are for. [[00:16:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1008.0s)]
*  What do you think? [[00:16:55](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1015.0s)]
*  What are the stakes of having an armed society like we have? [[00:16:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1017.0s)]
*  The thing about any democratic society is that it is built on at least the principle of equality between persons, right? [[00:17:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1021.0s)]
*  That we count equally politically, but we also count equally socially. [[00:17:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1028.0s)]
*  And that's how this is supposed to work. [[00:17:12](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1032.0s)]
*  But the kind of society of unlimited open arms, right? [[00:17:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1034.0s)]
*  That's what constitutional carry means. [[00:17:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1038.0s)]
*  All these buzzwords for just anyone can buy a weapon and anyone can carry it without any kind of licensing or anything. [[00:17:20](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1040.0s)]
*  And you have to think that anyone you might encounter might be carrying. [[00:17:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1046.0s)]
*  Right. [[00:17:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1049.0s)]
*  That obliterates any attempt for people to meet each other as equals, to insist on respect from each other, to engage in the world together. [[00:17:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1050.0s)]
*  Because when you know, when you are aware that the wrong word to the wrong person could lead to your annihilation, not you're not going to feel bad. [[00:17:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1060.0s)]
*  It's not an insult. [[00:17:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1069.0s)]
*  It would be killed. [[00:17:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1070.0s)]
*  That essentially dissolves the ability to engage in anything like democratic discourse. [[00:17:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1072.0s)]
*  It dissolves the ability to exist in a society as equals because that puts you in a fundamentally unequal relation to the people around you. [[00:17:59](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1079.0s)]
*  That's exactly right. [[00:18:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1088.0s)]
*  It's the one phrase and I think someone else's law professor who coined this of the Second Amendment eating the first. [[00:18:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1089.0s)]
*  The Second Amendment eating the entire constitution. [[00:18:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1094.0s)]
*  The whole constitution. [[00:18:16](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1096.0s)]
*  I'm Mel Bowie, one of my favorite writers and thinkers on all matters of public affairs. [[00:18:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1097.0s)]
*  Thank you for coming in the studio. [[00:18:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1101.0s)]
*  Come back any time. [[00:18:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1RcO9QLaeM&t=1102.0s)]
