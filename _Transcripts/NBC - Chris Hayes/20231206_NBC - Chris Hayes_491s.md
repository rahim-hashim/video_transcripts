Video Description: Rob Reiner joins Chris Hayes to discuss Norman Lear’s legacy. “He wanted to give people a chance to see both sides, to have the discussion, and then talk about it,” says Reiner. “If you wanted to watch the show, you had to watch it when it was on. 40-45 million people every week had a shared experience and we talked about the issues. We’re so fractured and we don’t really get to talk to each other.”

# Rob Reiner remembers friend Norman Lear’s legacy 'He fought his entire life for democracy'
**NBC - Chris Hayes:** [December 06, 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro)
*  Legendary television producer Norman Lear has died at age 101. Lear is [[00:00:00](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=0.0s)]
*  responsible for some of the most indelible TV shows of the 20th century [[00:00:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=5.6000000000000005s)]
*  including the Jeffersons, Good Times, Maud, Sanford and Son. He may best be [[00:00:08](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=8.88s)]
*  remembered for the first show he developed all in the family, a sitcom [[00:00:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=13.86s)]
*  built around Archie Bunker played by Carol O'Connor as the bigoted, oafish [[00:00:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=17.52s)]
*  father-in-law who constantly butts head with his daughter's left-wing husband [[00:00:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=22.26s)]
*  played by Rob Reiner. [[00:00:26](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=26.38s)]
*  That will make you Polish then. [[00:00:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=56.38s)]
*  Yeah. [[00:01:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=62.38s)]
*  Anything interesting in the paper? [[00:01:09](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=69.38s)]
*  Yeah, 200 arrested at a Vietnam Day peace demonstration. 200. They should have thrown a whole bunch of them in the can. [[00:01:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=71.38s)]
*  Look at that picture there. Here they are. Throwing all kinds of junk and debas at officers of the law. [[00:01:18](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=78.38s)]
*  Desecrate on the American flag. The hell are them peace-leaders want anyhow? [[00:01:25](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=85.38s)]
*  Now Archie Bunker is supposed to be lovable in spite of his laws not because of them but to many [[00:01:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=89.38s)]
*  Americans his open racism and misogyny was something to be celebrated even [[00:01:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=94.38s)]
*  emulated which may explain why as Norman Lear wrote in the New York Times last year [[00:01:38](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=98.88s)]
*  nearly 50 years after All in the Family first premiered that America elected a [[00:01:42](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=102.88s)]
*  man like Archie Bunker as its 45th president. Rob Reiner starred in Norman Lear's All in the Family [[00:01:46](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=106.5s)]
*  as you just saw the two were lifelong friends but Reiner calling Lear a second father [[00:01:52](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=112.38s)]
*  and Lear financing a number of Reiner's films including This is Spinal Tap and The Princess Bride. [[00:01:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=116.38s)]
*  Actor, director and activist Rob Reiner joins me. Now it's such a great honor to have you Rob [[00:02:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=121.38s)]
*  and first just condolences on the passing of a man I know that was an enormous influence in your life. [[00:02:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=127.38s)]
*  Yeah, no. Like you said he was a second father to me. I mean I was very lucky to have two men in my life [[00:02:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=133.38s)]
*  who were great role models and Norman showed me how you could use your celebrity use your fame to advance [[00:02:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=141.38s)]
*  issues that you cared about. I mean I learned from him when he started People for the American Way [[00:02:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=151.38s)]
*  that you could accomplish a lot by using your platform and so I miss him already. I love him [[00:02:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=156.38s)]
*  and I've known him since I'm a little kid and I'm glad to be able to come on your show to talk about him [[00:02:45](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=165.38s)]
*  because this is a man who he flew 57 bombing missions over Nazi Germany in the Second World War. [[00:02:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=173.38s)]
*  He fought his entire life for democracy and against fascism and we had so many conversations [[00:03:04](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=184.38s)]
*  even recently in the last couple of months that he couldn't recognize the country that he fought for so hard [[00:03:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=194.38s)]
*  and we now see ourselves on the verge of maybe slipping into fascism and it's just you know you can't [[00:03:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=202.38s)]
*  wrap your head around what's happened to this country and how a man like Norman who fought so hard [[00:03:32](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=212.38s)]
*  could see this happening and you know he mentioned in that op-ed that we've got a man like Archie Bunker [[00:03:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=220.38s)]
*  in the White House but the truth of the matter is Archie Bunker he was a racist, he was a bigot, [[00:03:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=228.38s)]
*  he was very conservative but he was human. He loved his wife, he loved his daughter, [[00:03:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=234.38s)]
*  he even loved his son-in-law who he fought with mercilessly. Donald Trump is not, he doesn't have any feelings, [[00:04:02](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=242.38s)]
*  he's not human, he's a psychopath and he has the makings and you guys have been talking about it for days now. [[00:04:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=251.38s)]
*  This man and he says it, he's a fascist, he wants to rule as an autocrat, as a dictator and we have a big choice [[00:04:19](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=259.38s)]
*  and I love that I can come on your show and talk about this because you know to speak for Norman that we have a choice. [[00:04:29](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=269.38s)]
*  We can either choose fascism or democracy and that is it and that's simple and you know we can argue about issues [[00:04:36](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=276.38s)]
*  once we've saved the democracy. Yeah let me read from something he wrote about this, about authoritarianism. [[00:04:44](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=284.38s)]
*  He says you know as a young man I dropped out of college when the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor, I flew more than 50 missions [[00:04:51](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=291.38s)]
*  in a B-17 bomber to defeat fascism consuming Europe. I'm a flag-waving believer in truth, justice and the American way [[00:04:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=297.38s)]
*  and I don't understand how so many people who call themselves patriots can support efforts to undermine our democracy [[00:05:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=303.38s)]
*  and our constitution, it is alarming and one of the things I find so remarkable and admirable about his career [[00:05:07](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=307.38s)]
*  is here's a guy who was you know a stalwart liberal his whole life outspoken who managed to sort of pull off this very difficult thing [[00:05:13](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=313.38s)]
*  which is to sort of live his politics and to navigate the studio system and the bosses and to make great entertaining funny television [[00:05:21](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=321.38s)]
*  all of which that embodied his world view which is you know probably better than anyone, threading those needles is just astoundingly difficult [[00:05:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=330.38s)]
*  and for him to do that time and time again over the decades he did is just a stupendous achievement. [[00:05:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=341.38s)]
*  It is and what you say is exactly true, it is incredibly difficult to be able to deal with real characters with real issues [[00:05:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=347.38s)]
*  that are facing all of us to present both sides and one of his favorite plays of all time was Major Barber by George Bernard Shaw [[00:05:57](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=357.38s)]
*  and if you didn't know that Shaw was a liberal and you saw that play you'd say well he presents both sides the pro-war, anti-war case equally [[00:06:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=365.38s)]
*  and that's what he wanted to do with all the family, he wanted to give people a chance to see both sides, to have the discussion and then talk about it [[00:06:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=374.38s)]
*  and we were a nation of 200 million people at the time and if you wanted to watch the show you had to watch it when it was on [[00:06:22](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=382.38s)]
*  there was no TV, DVR, TVO or anything you had to watch it so that means 40 to 45 million people every week had a shared experience [[00:06:30](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=390.38s)]
*  and we talked about the issues, you know we're so fractured and we don't really get to talk to each other [[00:06:40](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=400.38s)]
*  we have one side, you know I say I disagree with Liz Cheney but I'm on the side of Liz Cheney when we decide we want to save democracy [[00:06:47](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=407.38s)]
*  let's talk, let's argue about the issues once we save democracy but right now you don't have a Republican and a Democrat [[00:06:56](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=416.38s)]
*  you've got Democrats and then you've got, you know it's like I said you want to have an argument about an issue [[00:07:05](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=425.38s)]
*  you have to both agree that 2 plus 2 is 4, then once you agree to that then you can discuss [[00:07:11](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=431.38s)]
*  but we have one party that says 2 plus 2 is 4 and the other party that says 2 plus 2 is Thursday or something [[00:07:17](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=437.38s)]
*  I don't know what it is and that's the way Norman worked, he would get a laugh out of it [[00:07:24](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=444.38s)]
*  and it is the toughest thing in the world to do what he did [[00:07:31](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=451.38s)]
*  An incredible, incredible career and also from every account I've ever heard of the Maya, just a true mensch, just a truly decent dude [[00:07:35](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=455.38s)]
*  Rob Reiner, thank you so much for sharing a little bit of your memories of a great man that we lost, thank you [[00:07:41](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=461.38s)]
*  Yes, thanks Chris [[00:07:48](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=468.38s)]
*  Thank you [[00:07:54](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q21keU__1Ro&t=474.38s)]
